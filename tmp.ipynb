       " 'Black Wolf was taking a walk around his tribe... [SEP] Eyebrows furrowed and lips thinned, Black Wolf held his hand out to catch the white specks drifting down from the sky. The first snow of the year was falling, and earlier than usual.  \\n\\nThe ‘white doe’ tribe of the Northeast had been falling upon hard times in recent years with the advance of white settlements. Skirmishes with them and competition for food continued to dwindle the numbers of the tribe even as it was getting pushed further and further up the barren mountains. Only Black Wolf’s adept leadership and immense ability was keeping the tribe intact at this time, as material shortages and internal conflict threatened to tear it apart altogether. Black Wolf himself was a vastly experienced hunter and forager, and he himself managed to provide much of the tribe’s much needed sustenance. But as his salt and pepper mane of wavy hair evidenced, he was getting old. \\n\\nAs he coughed in the cold, Black Wolf mused to himself that he did not have much time left either. The elders were already pressuring him to step down, and he had to pass on the leadership soon or the tribe could very well disintegrate. To this end, Black Wolf favoured a young and whip-smart brave called ‘Falling Rocks’. While slight of build and not the strongest, Falling Rocks was not only very courageous but also had great general acumen. Known for his astute tactical mind and signature move of jumping off ledges and trees to kill prey and enemies alike, Falling Rocks had Black Wolf’s complete faith. However, a large number favoured his brutish rival, ‘Tall Bear’, who was an absolute physical specimen and formidable warrior but who was however not necessarily the sharpest tool in the shed. Black Wolf knew that he could not possibly just name Falling Rocks as the leader without holding a fair contest, so he called all the aspiring leaders to meet him on a neighbouring plateau the following morning. Dutifully, 5 brave warriors including Falling Rocks and Tall Bear turned up, and Black Wolf addressed the small group.\\n\\n‘Braves of the white doe, I have led this tribe for 32 years and my time is rightfully ending. I now challenge all of you to compete for the leadership and your task is as follows: hike west as far as you can, and the one who goes the furthest while bringing me back something as proof of your travels shall be the new leader.’ \\n\\nHenceforth, Black Wolf returned to the plateau every day from dusk till dawn to wait for any returning warriors. After 1 month, the first brave returned and met the veteran leader. ‘Sir, I hiked westwards as you instructed until I reached a white man settlement that was so densely patrolled that I dared not venture further, and it was there I decided to turn back.’ After handing Black Wolf the head of a decapitated patrol, the first brave was sent back to resume his normal duties.\\n\\nAnother 2 months saw the return of a second brave, who told Black Wolf, ‘Sir, I hiked west so far as to reach a vast lake that seemed endless on every side, that I felt that I could go no further and it was there I decided to turn back.’ Handing Black Wolf a tangle of lake weeds, the second brave was also sent back to continue his life. \\n\\nOnly after 4 months did the third brave return, and he told Black Wolf, ‘Sir, I travelled west all the way to a colossal range of mountains, far taller than the one we have here. Seeing no way around or over it, I felt that I could go no further and it was there I decided to turn back. He passed Black Wolf the horn of a mountain goat and returned to the tribe.\\n\\nA year on from the original challenge, neither Tall Bear nor Falling Rocks had returned, and winter was approaching again. Hungry and angry, the elders and the rest of the tribe were beginning to heap pressure on Black Wolf to end this nonsensical challenge and name the third brave as the new leader. Yet, Black Wolf held out, as he still wanted Falling Rocks to succeed him. But as it got progressively colder and the dissent started boiling over, Black Wolf knew that he could not control the tribe for much longer. On a day where a rebellious and a loyalist faction almost started fighting, Black Wolf intervened with the last vestige of his waning authority. \\n\\n‘Tribe, I will go out one last day tomorrow, and if nobody returns, I will name the third brave as the new leader.’ \\n\\nAnd so, Black Wolf climbed onto the plateau the next morning, and waited till it was almost dark. But just as he was about to resign to fate and head back, a lone figure approached against the backdrop of the last bit of sun. It was Tall Bear! Addressing Black Wolf, Tall Bear recounted, ‘Sir, I went so far as to reach another sea. I knew it was not the same sea as here as the fish were different and the water tasted different, but it was definitely the sea nevertheless. Seeing no end to the shore, I felt that I could go no further and it was there that I decided to turn back.’ \\n\\nThat night, the tribe conducted their age-old handover ritual, and Tall Bear became the new leader. Relieved from his duties and without a sense of purpose anymore, Black Wolf’s health fell off a cliff and he tragically began a steep and terminal decline. Only weeks later, he was on his deathbed. With the entire white doe kneeling and weeping before his bed with Tall Bear at the front, Black Wolf raised his voice to make one last address to the tribe.\\n\\n‘Tribe, I have led you for 33 years and I only have 1 last request. Falling Rocks has not returned but I know he is out there and he will return. The only thing I want you to promise me is that none of you will ever forget him, and you will wait for him until he comes back.’ \\n\\nAnd with that, Black Wolf breathed his last breath. A grieving tribe mourned throughout the night, and they collectively promised to honour Black Wolf’s last wish. That is why till this day\\n\\n&gt;!we still see signs on the mountains that say: look out for Falling Rocks.!&lt;',\n",
