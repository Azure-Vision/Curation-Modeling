2007scape,removed,sure here are some examples
2007scape,removed,well for the same reason emily didnt get perm banned for rwt top streamers are above regular players and other person streamers and its quite apparent you could be a paying member for years straight and you wouldnt compare to the top streamers because they give the game publicity when its the same cancer chat and people watching the streams

2007scape,removed,buddy chuckles holy shit you must be an obese neckbeard to use terminology like that your obesity and accountbuying aside the fact still stands that house parties were dramatically more active than they are now an overexaggerated portrayal simply due to a j mod being there doesnt negate the fact that they were still wildly popular if anything it only further validates the fact that house parties was an active aspect of the community far more than they are now dead the fact youre even contesting that proves you either a bought your account and youre arguing from ignorance or b you never frequented house parties to begin with
2007scape,removed,i really think youre the stubborn one because you still fail to see were not talking about the same thing have you even read what i wrote maybe its time to look in a mirror because not once did i ever comment on the strength of the fog or how balanced it is the item wasnt bugged thats what all i was saying about the gas nothing else if you cant see that then lets just agree to disagree to each their own this is the last time im commenting on this frankly autistic comment chain

2007scape,removed,what the fuck is wrong with some people
2007scape,removed,fucking sad im an alfie sub hope nothing happened
2007scape,removed,psa swatting is not funny or hilarious if you do think it is funny to waste resources like that and potentially get the streamer shot you need to grow up its dangerous
2007scape,removed,yeah these retards who downvoted me are the same ones who go into tourney worlds maging in full ahrims and get banged out by someone who knows what theyre doing in full mystic muh rng total luck
2007scape,removed,maybe if youre an edgy year old faggot absolutely nothing about swatting is funny
2007scape,removed,how does this happen people share personal details and then they guess the approximation of the users house or they get them on teamspeak and steal their ip wtf
2007scape,removed,for the amount of people that bother the guy alfie really is a nice guy though
2007scape,removed,how exactly do they find out where this guy lives arent the phonecalls recorded so they could catch the person
2007scape,removed,legit someone in chat moments before cop comes in ever get swatted before not funny at all hope hes doing okay
2007scape,removed,holy shit what has our world come to poor guy gets swatted over livestreaming rs being a streamer is a risky job if you think about it fucking hell
2007scape,removed,this is really sad a similar thing happened to james varga aka phantomlord who used to be a famous league of legends streamer now streams csgo often if im not mistaken heres his video explaining the situation
2007scape,removed,it takes a special kind of degen to waste the swat teams time just for a laugh
2007scape,removed,honestly not that big of a deal wasting resources like what gas if anything its good training for the swat team the only problem with this is alfie mightve been hurt which is really a problem of police brutality etc
2007scape,removed,thats banter
2007scape,removed,talking shit to people who say dumb things is hardly the same thing says pogchamp once hurrr stop the me mes skillspecs you all sound like fucking tards

2007scape,removed,takes at least a week from bots should never last more than a week the bot detection system is broken and needs to be retuned every time one bot gets detected another one takes its place there are literally like osrs bots out there and apparently theyre lasting longer than a week of straight botting i might get in on this s
2007scape,removed,every single level he has is something you can easily bot apparently woodcutting bots are a little too easy to bot with seems pretty lucrative i should get in on this
2007scape,removed,good point still frustrating when bots have better stats than you it feels like all the time ive spent playing the game is wasted and i couldve just botted myself to whatever level i wanted with no effort at all i guess im just salty that a bot crashed me its just really annoying
2007scape,removed,so where does that put the bot detection system seems like its not working very well
2007scape,removed,also true i guess im just salty that i got crashed after being at a spot for hours by myself dickhead couldnt even look for another world that was free which there are probably of them i told him if he hopped and couldnt find a world id be glad to share the spot with him apparently that was too much to ask for

2007scape,removed,go doesnt exist retard get educated
2007scape,removed,he can build a case with a lawyer and demand investigation you are extremely autistic if you actually believe this
2007scape,removed,because i dont accept money from the british free since yet youre playing a british made game and pay for membership also it just sounds like youre really butthurt that you got fucked out of stay salty faggot hahaha
2007scape,removed,sonic is an idiot so i wouldnt believe him anyways
2007scape,removed,ever heard of remote connection specifically chrome remote desktop pleb
2007scape,removed,he gave to rot but now him and his family have already been doxed and messed with
2007scape,removed,so in other words you made something up to discredit what i said you managed to be both a hypocrite and a liar or just an idiot but ill assume youre smarter than that in a minute conversation thats impressive youd make a great politician
2007scape,removed,kids got autism clearly jealous
2007scape,removed,do they know youre autistic
2007scape,removed,or the retards that can play this game can just accept things arent going to be best in slot for the next years
2007scape,removed,cunt
2007scape,removed,are you trolling or just genuinely retarded they have already confirmed that it doesnt work on pvp
2007scape,removed,if you dont capitalize the word pogchamp properly it doesnt proc my plugin pls be considerate
2007scape,removed,u are a pussy ass bitch ur saying ud let people fuck with ur family u wouldnt make people harassing ur family stop shits a joke to everyone till it happens to u
2007scape,removed,mad
2007scape,removed,eat chicken niqqers
2007scape,removed,they can unless youve worked for them for years which i imagine is unlikely for a runescape player who is likely fairly young
2007scape,removed,toxic cunts like you ruined this community
2007scape,removed,realistically what did you expect him to reply with to that retarded remark you made
2007scape,removed,the fact that tards vote for shit that made the game awful over and over is fucking hilarious knew it would be like this since gwd glad i didnt bother investing time into the game
2007scape,removed,why did you do that nigga he with us nigga he had my three piece nugget nigga
2007scape,removed,you know there actually is a chest there on pvp worlds im sure the stool in fally has the same mechanics as this bush
2007scape,removed,must be pretty autistic to split with strangers on the internet tbh
2007scape,removed,what do you mean random the mods confirmed nature rune has to do with it you dense fucking chimp so going around doing this may actually help fucking idiot
2007scape,removed,im curious as to what degree of autism you need to do that all day everyday on this game i swear some peoples mothers should have had the abortion
2007scape,removed,that is so fucking retarded question im not gonna even answer to that like seriously
2007scape,removed,only poor idiots who cant afford ely vote yes
2007scape,removed,you said it you spent all of seconds to think about something then you get mad because they want to introduce something new into the game it pathetic just because you dont like pvm it means youre going to sulk grow the fuck up you pathetic little man child
2007scape,removed,is that the virgin handbook
2007scape,removed,theyre all cunts let them destroy themselves
2007scape,removed,lmao like it matters youre just going to repoll it next month youre idiots the lot of you working at jagex
2007scape,removed,apparently the only reason people are voting no is because they think the damage reduction will be useful in pvp people need to watch dev blogs before being cunts it does not work in pvp
2007scape,removed,lmao ridiculous that youre getting downvoted for spelling out the pvm meta for these morons good one reddit
2007scape,removed,are you that autistic guy that uses two different reddit accounts to argue with people
2007scape,removed,do you pride yourself on being a faggot
2007scape,removed,autism
2007scape,removed,its already not allowed in pvp can u not read or did u not bother reading or are you retarded
2007scape,removed,youre a retard and have never watched or heard of any competitive sport in history i think youre actually retarded

2007scape,removed,youre an idiot lol
2007scape,removed,dank shitpost
2007scape,removed,its credited in the comment itself with a watermark
2007scape,removed,i use openjdk jre and konduit use whichever jre you want such that the client supports it security issues isnt a big deal unless youre using java within the browser as an applet i suggest trying to use another client like konduit that is a little less intensive on system resources
2007scape,removed,you mean retards like the ones that lose valuable items due to ddos
2007scape,removed,god mate just shut the fuck up

2007scape,removed,if its your first time with your bf take it slow make sure you are both ready dont feel like theres too much pressure as for the best experience light some candles have a nice meal and a glass of wine but dont overdo it foreplay is important remember its called foreplay for a reason have fun with it when it comes to best gp you disgust me you fucking whore

2007scape,removed,c​ould this be an e​​pic new m​eme
2007scape,removed,this beta male needs to get some boom to his voice he was trying to be funny but ended up whimpering like a bitch
2007scape,removed,yea after looking at your comment history ill just tell you that youre clearly depressed as fuck so why dont you go and end it all already nobody would care
2007scape,removed,if you want this kind of shit go to
2007scape,removed,can you please stop posting gay shit on this subreddit man
2007scape,removed,wtf who likes to tank
2007scape,removed,c​ould this be an e​​pic new m​eme
2007scape,removed,fucking youtube it yourself retard
2007scape,removed,everytime you comment you condemn yourself to being a bigger and bigger idiot youre contradicting yourself literally in your own thread shut the hell up and move on stop trying to force people to play your way
2007scape,removed,yeah thts right u fkn downie get back to ur apparently years of runescape
2007scape,removed,i dont like getting crashed obviously but i really dont give a fuck dont think jagex is just going to add two new servers well see on the poll for sure but im sure it will be converting other worlds as for people wasting the best slayer spots they have as much right to play there as you so fuck off with your elitist bullshit and let everyone enjoy the game how they want to im not against rewarding people for having high levels but i think those rewards should be unlocking new content not getting their own elitist circlejerk club on a separate server i completely disagree that players who have put in many hours shouldnt be treated the same as newermore casual players just because i have logged a bunch of hours doesnt make me entitled to not compete for resources
2007scape,removed,ugh fuck off shitty troll getting your acc maxed as an adult vs getting your acc maxed as a kid the first one is more sad period it has nothing to do with me now fuck off
2007scape,removed,i knew players wouldnt be able to handle this lol
2007scape,removed,for the love of god stop posting about this fucking monkey you realise hes dying on purpose because these jad attempts are getting him way more viewers than usual fucking cancer man child viewers of his
2007scape,removed,found one of his autist viewers that is too blind to see that hes manipulating you retards with his fake reactions long periods of silence to bait text to speech donations i feel sorry for you honestly
2007scape,removed,if reading something on the internet makes you sad you really should consider ending your pathetic life
2007scape,removed,you should follow him into the noose
2007scape,removed,id rather watch someone for their honest reactions and personalty not this obvious over the top fake shit
2007scape,removed,and you play you waste of human life
2007scape,removed,if you cant manage to flick between ticks you probably need to seek medical help you fucking retard
2007scape,removed,second guessing a boss mechanic made in that must really sum up your life and the way its going
2007scape,removed,exactly they are gamebreaking changes that ruin the interactiveness of the game overlays that render on top of the world in any way at all for any reason is cheating in my eyes also anything that uses any information from the client that is not already displayed in a menu somewhere in game is also cheating thats why the orbs dont bother me since that is on the line of qol ui modding yet showing the exact amount of hp the enemy has is cheating
2007scape,removed,his viewers are fucking worse than drones posting this cringe worthy pathetic man child to this sub at every opportunity blacks were used to laugh at for entertainment years ago and they still are via twitch fucking apes
2007scape,removed,pages you view in incognito tabs wont stick around in your browsers history cookie store or search history after youve closed all of your incognito tabs any files you download or bookmarks you create will be kept however you arent invisible going incognito doesnt hide your browsing from your employer your internet service provider or the websites you visit

2007scape,removed,this doesnt exist check on google this phrase and apparently a user that deserves to be banned didnt get ban shows up emily jagex mods need to stop thinking with their private parts for these kinda things
2007scape,removed,no this is sparta xd
2007scape,removed,apparently not very carefully because you picked an idiotic word and you are too much of a coward to even provide an opinion to supplement it
2007scape,removed,shed look better if her lips were fuller ps nudes where

2007scape,removed,just a little tip for you guys that enjoy rcing you can get khal aio runecrafter on osbot and enjoy the same exprates you have now with even less effort
2007scape,removed,you dont get bans from using premium osbot scripts like khal scripts after total level as long as you arent using popular goldfarming methods and looking like a bot and botting hours a day if you are botting yews in then yeah say goodbye to your account but if you are using khal aio runecrafter on a main in a normal graceful setup you arent going to get banned unless people see you on the same world hours a day

2007scape,removed,trying to design deadman mode for pkers only is like trying to design an ocean habitat full of sharks its never going to survive what is the problem with that habitat is it that life is too hard being a shark fighting bigger sharks or that there arent enough fish to go around give a reason for the people who dont pk on deadman to spend their time there anyone on deadman already knows that some people are willing to do this to swap gold to but the problem remains that there is no current reason to hold onto seasonal deadman itemsgold find a way to fix that problem and there will be more fish players trying to get rich and a bunch of hungry shark pkers following close behind

2007scape,removed,but mmuh safe space
2007scape,removed,could you imagine how shit fucking garbage ass tastic this world would be if every time somebody said hiter did nothing wrong they lost thousands of hours of their lives what the fuck you asshole give them their accounts back
2007scape,removed,they are sitting on the newest posts page hitting refresh and deleting posts as they wish i even asked what are we allowed to post and they even deleted that as well bunch of nazis making the situation worse than it is
2007scape,removed,nice name dino retard
2007scape,removed,they care more about cancer faking streamer than people ragging in a minigame its fucking ridiculous
2007scape,removed,no they are deleting new posts this is fucking reddit let people decide what they want to see and what they dont theres a voting system for a reason
2007scape,removed,i wish we could concentrate on this rather than unbanning toxic players lets tag umodkieren because hes probably not been spammed by the whole sub
2007scape,removed,that is what i call harassment he was probably wanking it in the office to her
2007scape,removed,emily fakes autism
2007scape,removed,of courshe mod mat kuck refused our offer in favor of emilys so we had to know what favors she offered him
2007scape,removed,fuck you fucking shitheads
2007scape,removed,youre retarded and cant undsrstand something this simple
2007scape,removed,good suggestion jagex should not get away with this
2007scape,removed,it is literally your job to deal with the community you actually get paid for this shit and youre failing to do that over one streamer cuck
2007scape,removed,that is because jagex is being retarded right now
2007scape,removed,jagex did not bad people just for wearing desert robes mystic hat and a noose they were banned because of the spam of racism and how it was organizing large groups of people to circle around saying kill the black monkeys that is not harmless roleplaying how could jagex possibly be in the wrong for that there would have been a difference if they dressed like that but didnt spam hate messages but thats not the case it got out of hand big time so to avoid that which now leads us to this giant shitshow and im willing to bet the two banned knew all along something like this would happen couldnt care less about the game and just wants to see how far this goes people are unsubscribing because they think jagex wrongfully banned people this is getting way out of hand
2007scape,removed,fuck that guy
2007scape,removed,no weve fucking had enough this is too fucking stupid fuck off you dumb british cunts
2007scape,removed,oh fuck off with that they didnt even say shit go fuck yourselves you dumb cunts
2007scape,removed,spamming cry emote at her is just a nonverbal fuck you and yeah i sure know why she is not liked i dont like her either but i dont think she deserves to be bullied constantly while streaming shes just a person after all what does she have to do before people stop harassing her okay maybe the viewbot thing
2007scape,removed,ban emily
2007scape,removed,oh fuck off already
2007scape,removed,muh safe space
2007scape,removed,youre a special kind of tard
2007scape,removed,only the sticky from mod ronan which got fucking slaughtered by downvotes serves the bastard right
2007scape,removed,so some random neckbeard somewhere is annoyed of one particular stream and just decides to ban his twitch account seems about right to me
2007scape,removed,ban her already
2007scape,removed,you fucking useless fat lesbian looking little cunt fuck off with your lol idc attitude you utter piss stain
2007scape,removed,they just banned my main from this sub for asking what we are allowed to post on here because they keep deleting threads yes thank you very much mods
2007scape,removed,we should ban him
2007scape,removed,ban me
2007scape,removed,most emily related posts have over upvotes currently so i find it completely plausible that she gets that many viewers on twitch my god this community is cancer
2007scape,removed,i never faked cancer i was diagnosed
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,she talks about not wanting to be treated like this and doesnt want the hate she says she didnt fake having cancer and she never took any donations for chemotherapy she says she wont prove she didnt fake it because theres no point and either way she will be harassed she doesnt get why we cant all be friends everything before and after is random jibberish overall not worth the watch she didnt really say anything she hasnt said before
2007scape,removed,my issue is that cancer cant just go away she never had chemo so how did it go away was it a misdiagnosis we have proof that she said i was diagnosed with cancer and now she is saying she didnt lie about it so only of things happened she was misdiagnosed and doesnt want to reveal this but that would help clear this up she is lying
2007scape,removed,bikerscx ill post a link to a thread about it when i get off work
2007scape,removed,you are just proving my point lmao youre too stupid to say anything smart so you just play the white knight card oh god how do you not realize how retarded you look in other peoples eyes
2007scape,removed,guess what nobody gives a fuck about you either
2007scape,removed,man it hurts so much to see how many people think its okay to act like racist spastics but thank god theres people like you who arent angry at this like i am
2007scape,removed,is that really it some dude wants the epussy and thats what causes the drama
2007scape,removed,ugh go away keemstar youre a cunt
2007scape,removed,probably because its a shitty meme that died years ago and at this point you are all taking the piss on its grave dancing around it like a bunch of heathens its not funny youre not funny this is gay as fuck and you should all hang from the rafters for spreading such cancer unironically
2007scape,removed,lol no the reason things are the way they are right now is because this is how the runescape community is yo like u mess wit d community u best prepare to get ganked lil nigga tf u thinkin 😂😂 🙏👌👌wit yo bannin ppl for fkn followin 😕😕 like nigga stfu 🤐🤐😡😠 u embarrasin smh smh fkn jagex 👮 more lyk scamflex amirite 💦💦😎
2007scape,removed,wtf yeah im reporting you
2007scape,removed,she likes licking modmatcuck chopsticks
2007scape,removed,emily attracts traffic to their game no it attracts negative traffic its come to the point where people are learning runescape as the game with a girl who faked cancer
2007scape,removed,emily is a female streamer shes like the most hated runescape streamer mainly because she faked cancer for donations anyways this emily was livestreaming and people were harrassing her ingame and this bazinga guy was just following her character not doing anything and a jagex moderator company that owns rs banned the people harrassing including this bazinga guy who did nothing wrong now hes claiming they all deserved to be banned but he wont release any form of evidence chatlogs etc and the community is upset because they dont agree with the bans some of the jagex employees agree with the community and now theres basically a riot going on ingame demanding evidence that the bans were legitimate
2007scape,removed,low energy
2007scape,removed,keemstar is a bigger fucking idiot than emily
2007scape,removed,faking intensifies
2007scape,removed,you had some good info but jesus the last part makes you sound fucking retarded
2007scape,removed,as you all undoubtedly have noticed the front page almost entirely consists of posts relating to the recent harassment bans nazi dictator
2007scape,removed,autist op acts like phish streams dont get removed daily sjw keep trying
2007scape,removed,white knight
2007scape,removed,nice meme
2007scape,removed,are u retarded
2007scape,removed,i dont see what that has to do with me telling you you dont want to be near this shit storm but since you insisted people have been getting banned in game for supposedly harassing a streamer by doing emotes near her while she was live now everyone and their grandmother are claiming to be banned for it including this guy who wants a mod to release his chat log to prove he wasnt saying anything to her
2007scape,removed,build a wall and make mod mat kuck pay for it
2007scape,removed,lol
2007scape,removed,never even played this game but i know white knight faggots when i see them
2007scape,removed,mod ronan is such a faggot for the reply on this thread
2007scape,removed,sack this piece of shit they call mod mat k hes not needed in the jagex community fucking coward
2007scape,removed,she sucks dick well
2007scape,removed,cam whore turned rs streamer whore faked cancer for sympathy and money got caught and tried to pretend it never happened
2007scape,removed,keemstar is a fucking faggot himself but in this particular case even more spotlight on chemily would be great
2007scape,removed,you bunch of moderators are a bunch of cunts who need to focus on development and nothing more get off your high horse you bunch of fucking idiots
2007scape,removed,shut up with your excuses you fucking cunt
2007scape,removed,only one option left need to murder emily anyone know any hitmen
2007scape,removed,someone needs to inform jagex investors that their company is losing money because a old pervert has an obsession with a e whore
2007scape,removed,dont go near emily and dont trust the mods
2007scape,removed,how much sweat have you lost after bashing your keyboard for hours straight defending a girl on the internet
2007scape,removed,lol youre pathetic
2007scape,removed,xp waste
2007scape,removed,she gonna suicide hopefully
2007scape,removed,making a new account on a vpn and going to do the same shit everyone was banned for so we will really see if there are other racist comments being made in order to get banned or simply following mod mat ks favorite streamer
2007scape,removed,already sold my bank for had a great run overwatch four more days to go
2007scape,removed,she faked cancer for donations viewbots on twitch gets people who disrupt her game play and i use the term disrupt very loosely perm banned even if she is pked fairly in the wilderness or crashed this time mod mat k not mod mark he retired miss ya buddy just banned a bunch of people who were standing near her
2007scape,removed,topkek httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzjcgdxwgrs
2007scape,removed,new low from jagex supporting a faker and a liar httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzjcgdxwgrs
2007scape,removed,team mod mat cuck
2007scape,removed,yea man sure see here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzjcgdxwgrs
2007scape,removed,are the mods always like this
2007scape,removed,as someone who has wondered in from rall what is going on
2007scape,removed,ronan is a retard so im not sure why youre trying to white knight him
2007scape,removed,emoting near emily ban wearing my bank and begging no ban
2007scape,removed,release them you prepubescent bowl cut ugly fuck
2007scape,removed,fuck emily tho
2007scape,removed,i cant tell you hard i laughed and coming from a halfjew thats saying something
2007scape,removed,because theyre selectively banning people if they banned all the trolls and shit they would have half the community gone
2007scape,removed,people are quick to forget this is the same faggot that accused ray of being a rapist
2007scape,removed,send me nudes or im banning you bitch mod mat k is a smooth ass man
2007scape,removed,begs jagex to release chat logs assumes theyre gonna be faked before jagex even releases them you people are idiots lol
2007scape,removed,watch this and tell me if its a normal behavior httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwzjcgdxwgrs
2007scape,removed,twitch you idiot
2007scape,removed,bald characters to represent the possible hair loss during chemotherapy you can piece together the picture from here
2007scape,removed,yep the only reason this is finding any backing right now in this subreddit is because of the massive polarisation caused by nonexistent moderating anything thats remotely touching the subject and isnt by jagex means fuck yes and anything jagex supporting or relating is bad come on keemstar is essentially youtube cancer why is it even posted here
2007scape,removed,they would reply more if you autists didnt downvote them hundreds of times when they do
2007scape,removed,hows emilys pussy taste
2007scape,removed,will get downvoted but we jagex other companies never ban people who buy gold and always ban sellers its just the smarter way to do it never hit the buyer but always hit the seller is something blizzard started in or so with wow
2007scape,removed,theres a girl who live streams herself playing runescape with facecam in the corner people do things ingame like kill monsters she is trying to kill trade her goofy items and say things to stir up drama while all of these actions are within the games rules the jagex mods game employees banned a bunch of players taking part in this harassment and it looks like there was some collateral damage
2007scape,removed,shut the fuck up
2007scape,removed,later idiot
2007scape,removed,fuck you ronan
2007scape,removed,are you retarded
2007scape,removed,k bye faggot ur ugly and smell like shit anyways

2007scape,removed,this is not nonsense you idiot
2007scape,removed,which one sucked a mods dick
2007scape,removed,i like how returnofwild is trying to act like hes on our side now after he scammed rwt botted bullied and advertised gambling private servers dudes a cunt
2007scape,removed,people feel entitled in this streamers case attention good
2007scape,removed,if she got cancer i would be happy since if you fake it you deserve it she deserves the real pain those people go through dumb bitch cunt fuck off i hope you die emily
2007scape,removed,jagex is the single most unproffesional notable game dev in recent history in my opinion i was level with several rares and their behavior in recent years is the reason i dropped my shit and stopped playing the way they play favoritism with streamers and other community figureheads but disregard and couldnt care less about the rest of the community try to deny and cover up their mistakes just plain stopped looking at permanent ban appeals altogether except for streamers and yet are still insanely lenient on scammers and doublers and let them run rampant in their game they just plain do not care
2007scape,removed,emily should be gassed
2007scape,removed,ban the emily sub
2007scape,removed,did mod mat k engage in any private activity with a certain female streamer yet or is he still waiting on his payout
2007scape,removed,youre the type of fucking retard that falls for scamsconspiracy theories all it took for you to buy into his idea was some stupid reddit comment get off the internet before you hurt yourself youre too stupid
2007scape,removed,if youre making a post about people quitting over the emily situation and it didnt directly affect you you are retarded
2007scape,removed,mod mat k raped a cat

2007scape,removed,

2007scape,removed,no question just a gl lol
2007scape,removed,will mat k be appearing in this weeks q a
2007scape,removed,enjoy the shitstorm
2007scape,removed,careful with your comments boys this thread will likely be monitored and users will be banned rip
2007scape,removed,waddup with the chat logs
2007scape,removed,why cant jagex ever admit they make a mistake
2007scape,removed,when will mattk take his tongue out of emilys ass and when will ronan take his tongue out of mattks are they making a human centipede on purpose throwawayaccount
2007scape,removed,why is emily not banned yet
2007scape,removed,seriously youre just carrying on as normal your twitch stream is going to be toxic to the maximum i can already see the minute comment you give on it chat logs are too toxic to release therefore we wont to which the obvious response is surely you can let the players you banned see them its sort of how the system works you show them the evidence thats how coarse language and racism bans have always worked
2007scape,removed,whats up with all the favoritism
2007scape,removed,can we have the ability to place cannons in lumbridge this would make riots more accessible for new players
2007scape,removed,where are the chat logs why do you favor one person over the entire health of the community especially when that person faked a serious illness for personal gain had others doxxed etc
2007scape,removed,any plans on actually having customer service in the future
2007scape,removed,will mod mat k please be fired
2007scape,removed,will you guys do the right thing ban emily fire mod mat k and release the chat logs
2007scape,removed,if i pvp in the wilderness will i get banned cheers
2007scape,removed,what are the chances of the chat logs being released
2007scape,removed,when will the chat logs be released
2007scape,removed,why is releasing the chat logs immoral whilst a lot of other popular games like league of legends for example actually have people voting on whether the player was offensive by reading the chat logs
2007scape,removed,any plans on actually showing the evidence oh right you wont because you made that up
2007scape,removed,when will you hire a competent community manager with actual social skills unlike ronan in order to compensate for the consistently terrible decision making on communication
2007scape,removed,lol this stream is going to be chaos
2007scape,removed,dont forget to cancel your subscription on any accounts you dont regularly use and if anyone is subbed to their twitch please unsub
2007scape,removed,i love the fact that there are no serious questions if we keep this up they wont be able to fill hour of random shit
2007scape,removed,can you disable emotes and follow options they seem to make some people uncomfortable
2007scape,removed,can you fire mod matk and hire ramsay bolton as his replacement
2007scape,removed,if i get cancer can i have my own world
2007scape,removed,why cant you guys just admit you were wrong for once
2007scape,removed,guys this is important this is the level of respect they treat us with they dont think were logical humans and they think well just forget or move on in fucking hours jagex you shattered our trust and treating us like idiots is not the way to earn it back

2007scape,removed,does emily like it rough
2007scape,removed,who is getting fired after the recent turn of events
2007scape,removed,question are you going to show evidence are your team going to act like big boys and manage this recent issue professionally
2007scape,removed,get off your high horse jagex show your paying customers some respect by providing solid evidence for the recent bans or simply admit the favoritism
2007scape,removed,what an idiot he is

2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,can we poll banning emily your motto is if the community wants it so let the community decide if we want this rulebreaker in our game
2007scape,removed,whats your opinions on mod mat ks following page on twitch
2007scape,removed,mod mat k sucks emilys dick
2007scape,removed,did emily really kill a dog once
2007scape,removed,what a cunt i really hope he doesnt feel that he is in the right in this situation otherwise i have even less hope for os getting out of this situation

2007scape,removed,chris you cuntehhr
2007scape,removed,i have a few questions when are you going to release the chat logs when are you going to grow up and stop acting like tumblr sjws how does it feel knowing that your colleagues are creepy camgirl stalking wierdos why are you prioritizing banning people who perform in game emotes and not botters what the fuck were you thinking do you really think this will just go away have you ever heard of freedom of speech how does it feel knowing that most of your player base is turning against you how have you not learned from your past mistakes yet youve made enough lets be honest how does it feel knowing that jagex moderators are now some of the least trusted people in the game what is your cut of emilys donations how many jagex employees has emily sucked off
2007scape,removed,can we get a new project manager for osrs the current one is old and stubborn about his opinions
2007scape,removed,can we remove emotes from the game it may be a minor bug so not top priority but im afraid i might click an emote by mistake and get banned
2007scape,removed,when are you going to stop streamer favoritism
2007scape,removed,who dis graham cunt think he is
2007scape,removed,that guy looks like the biggest beta white knight if ive ever seen one neckbeard chubby probably wears a fedora probably plays rs all day long has no friends has to praise jmods for falslely banning players when it comes to protecting streamers disgusting him jmods and that whole lot
2007scape,removed,this is a preemptive question why are you asking questions that were downvoted to hell and not the ones that have the highest points
2007scape,removed,true but i feel like if enough people bring it up it might considering what she did is borderline illegal if they can prove she got money only for the reason she had cancer
2007scape,removed,do you have a vagina did you fuck a jmod and suck their shit covered cock clean no then fuck off retarded white kid jagex
2007scape,removed,yes hes notorious for this and if he gets unbanned itll be a joke one of the scummiest players and most deserved bans issued but reddit is taking exception to this cunt
2007scape,removed,i feel sorry for chris hes just trying to do his menial tasks laid out for the day lets cut the guy some slack
2007scape,removed,stop being such cunts avoiding everything look at how much problem one developer and one streamer causes the whole community open your eyes and get rid of them
2007scape,removed,i have a theory they were part of that year generation of retards huffing on canned air
2007scape,removed,hi chris just wondering what would mod matks wife think if she found out hes been following young female streamers on twitch and showing them favoritism over other players
2007scape,removed,what preschool did mat k graduate from his recent behaviour suggests he needs to go back since hes being such a big baby
2007scape,removed,the bootlicker has a neckbeard expected
2007scape,removed,ban graham dent
2007scape,removed,is it true that emily gave mat k a crusty toothy blowie at runefest and this is all a cover up has mat ks wife filed for divorce yet how would ikellie feel if you were in mat ks shoes she also hasnt accepted my friend request whats going on with that
2007scape,removed,yes because apparantly he is retarded
2007scape,removed,ban emily
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,can you all just chip in a bit so modmadmicrocock laid would stop him being a white knight for that e puss
2007scape,removed,idiots that pay his salary the fucking goon
2007scape,removed,ive lost all my trust in this team hopefully a bunch of players are gonna quit this game so they get what they deserve nothing anymore banning people for doing emotes and legit pking a person guess what next time you habe to be feared to that emily feels your presence insta ban lol tbh im already thinking about it this is the worst bullshit ive seen in years of runescape wilderness removal eoc no banning people for nothing because of a lying streamer cunt yes youve lost it hopefully the games dies out
2007scape,removed,hahahahhaha u must be glad fucking retard
2007scape,removed,im sorry but that offends me im going to call mod may k to have u banned k bye
2007scape,removed,welcome to nazi germany or turkey or saudi arabia or just simply runescape where any criticism is simply deleted heil adolf mat k
2007scape,removed,hey why did u pm me saying u downvoted this post
2007scape,removed,only people yeah right
2007scape,removed,niggers cx
2007scape,removed,what about the lvl guy dressed as who cried next to him at duel arena when was doing rc why he isnt getting banned
2007scape,removed,ubazingacx good fucking job you asshole
2007scape,removed,ni trihard
2007scape,removed,modmatk do you even work at kfc bro
2007scape,removed,but i just dont understand rwt is rwt regardless on how you see it it should be a perm ban youre basically saying im allowed to buy gold and admit it later and basically not have any repercussions
2007scape,removed,are you fucking retarded
2007scape,removed,whats funny is theres a chance he thinks this will get him laid poor old bastard
2007scape,removed,so many cxs autism
2007scape,removed,what specifically made them ban you obscure rules you only need one unwritten rule dont be an asshole by doing whatever you did you just bring in more attention to that person you are giving them the attention that keeps them relevant from what i can gather this emily person is someone who doesnt deserve attention or interest please stop providing it for her
2007scape,removed,youre a moron cx
2007scape,removed,this is the biggest meme in the history of memes i cant wait to see it all unfold
2007scape,removed,releasing one nameless persons chat logs out of people banned without dates is transparency are you retarded
2007scape,removed,fuck off mat
2007scape,removed,you got reported for being a pest that day then the mods took a quick look at the last couple months of your accounts and thats why you got banned
2007scape,removed,obviously all of them are retards from ice poseidons stream expected
2007scape,removed,upvote this if u hate cancer whores
2007scape,removed,how convincing chat bodies with literally no information this could have easily been put together by you which id guess is the case to save your ass gonna need far more proof than this just ban that bitch for lying and selling gold already
2007scape,removed,still avoiding the fucking topic you banned these players once they walked around emily if you were not weak to the victim card emily likes to play all the time none of this would ever of happened it still amazes me that out of all the negative publicity this has caused for jagex you continue to deny and deny emily s disgusting personality is the reason the community reacted in this way no other reason she should of been banned years ago for the rwt regardless of the faking a terminall illness for monetary gain and dont give us that buying is different than selling bs if you actually cared about what the community has to say which is quite clear you dont the community would be a much more positive place without that ugly catface streamer
2007scape,removed,what a surprise most were ice poseidon fans
2007scape,removed,nsfw tag yet censoredwow are jagex pussies
2007scape,removed,emily faked canser but only once emily killed a dog but only once emily rwt but only once
2007scape,removed,oh look an autistic kid
2007scape,removed,mod mat k loves emily emily cried that people are doing emotes near her character mod mat k bans these people reddit in an uproar mod mat k pulls out some random chat logs that could be from anyone at any time in history reddit sucks his cock and all is forgiven in a nutshell
2007scape,removed,its about ice poseidon and his teenage fanboys who are his buttlicker not sure why someone in ther mid would watch this downy doing whatever hes saying cuz hes their daddy
2007scape,removed,wait so saying niggers is a bannable offense now niggers
2007scape,removed,can all you witch hunting faggots shut the fuck up now and play the game unbelievable how many commenters in this sub act like bitchy year old girls
2007scape,removed,if given the chance would you suck dick to have a chance of sniffing emilys feet
2007scape,removed,would prefer if you killed yourself
2007scape,removed,shut the fuck up
2007scape,removed,what a surprise rawktail trying to beat a dead horse and whore karma go back to transcribing qna sessions kiddo
2007scape,removed,when will emily be banned for all the shit she has done
2007scape,removed,its none of that was really offensive and it was an obvious troll if you get offended by something as dumb as that dont turn on your computer dont use the internet its simple
2007scape,removed,lol and now everyone turns to other side and starts dickriding modmatk let the cursed circle continue for me im still sceptical because these could logs could still be forged also did you ban the guy who was making fun and mocking the death of a person who was in his rival clan or are you just being selective here
2007scape,removed,the mods are a bunch of cunts
2007scape,removed,atleast youre not stimulating tumor growth kek
2007scape,removed,i have a tip dont go near a player called or you will be banned
2007scape,removed,yes they all wear ancient d hide on every single fucking world holy fucking shit fuck emily do something jagex
2007scape,removed,pretending to have a disease which kills many people every year is good enough for me
2007scape,removed,dont take this guy serious op hes been sucking jagex their dick all day
2007scape,removed,so cherry picking whatever you want to hear theres a word for people like youcunt now fuck off back to school
2007scape,removed,is this autism
2007scape,removed,you dont speak for the community get off the high horse
2007scape,removed,ayy lmao xd
2007scape,removed,the amount of dick sucking since he posted that thread is hilarious
2007scape,removed,u retarded if u refresh the page it goes back to normal
2007scape,removed,you speak for no one
2007scape,removed,dude what the fuck are you talking about the him i was referring to was mod mat k mind your business and go fuck yourself
2007scape,removed,there is no witch hunt stop sympathising with cancer fakers
2007scape,removed,you aint speaking for me fam
2007scape,removed,you do not speak for the purple army cx
2007scape,removed,screenshots and all have something in common absolute mindless idiots from a certain stream hes probably the biggest contributor to this but he cant do anything about it
2007scape,removed,lol
2007scape,removed,so youre using this as leverage because you know you already screwed up if this meant anything you wouldve banned them on the spot and not wait until they stood around emily you look at of runescapes chat log your sure as hell gonna find something offensive
2007scape,removed,sit down you fucking idiots love these little liars getting exposedcalled out nothing makes me happier
2007scape,removed,not all of write like were uneducated idiots
2007scape,removed,and youve most likely served him fries
2007scape,removed,how the fuck do you get banned for that amount of trashtalk i dont even play runescape but ive been following this retarded piece of drama and i cant understand how people are banned for this amount of toxicity i play league of legends and the shit here could be compared to as being like a of what you need to do there to get banned the only banworthy stuff here maybe is saying the nword over and over then again if youre offended by that either grow a pair of balls or use the fucking mute button this is pathetic sjw jagex
2007scape,removed,social justice watch out for those mean words the pc police are here im being harassed by naughty words please help me
2007scape,removed,fuck off you useless little cunt
2007scape,removed,nice reading comprehension go back to school kid how did you manage to translate he banned them for doing emotes around emily the chat logs were used to justify this into chatlogs arent his lmao retard he banned them for doing emotes around emily then searched through their cc chatlogs to cover his unjust ban they deserve to be banned for racism but thats not the reason that they were banned the emotes around emily are
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,yes but i wouldnt be the fan of a girl who faked a serious disease for donations
2007scape,removed,go back to where you came from peasant
2007scape,removed,so you banned a player from your game that dressed as a member of the kkk do you know how stupid that sounds you developed the armors and clothing and now we cant wear certain combinations of white wow disgusting dictating devs
2007scape,removed,ya maybe if streamers werent already getting special treatment from jagex either way they are getting special treatment and either way youre retarded for white knighting for said streamers
2007scape,removed,and youre part of the retardation in this community
2007scape,removed,youre the cancer thats killing it
2007scape,removed,people are perfectly entitled not to have any respect for her after faking an illness which kills many people every year what she does in real life matters to me more than in game if she is streaming it
2007scape,removed,you call this harassed lol fuck off
2007scape,removed,keemstar is a total scumbag but he is no moron
2007scape,removed,i mean if the logs showing all that racist shit is true then thats fucked up and fuck you op too but even without those logs exposing you that probably still would count as harassment dressing up as characters models like emilys but bald to mock the cancer thing like i get it i really hate emily too but to follow her around and mock her like that probably should just count as harassment on its own i do not think you should get banned for it or maybe even muted except you should based off of your racist logs lmao but they should force a character change for you or something lol either way youre guilty as fuck and i hate emily too just my thoughts
2007scape,removed,i have no idea what happened really but apparently she lied about having cancer for twitch donations so some people copied the clothes she wears became bald and just kept doing the cry emote near her while she was streaming
2007scape,removed,cx
2007scape,removed,ahh finally some memes on this sub today
2007scape,removed,he already did you gremlinlooking twat
2007scape,removed,you smell like fisheggs you ugly twat
2007scape,removed,a month of entertainment is worth paying dollars for dont be a fuckin jew
2007scape,removed,didnt emily suck ur dick at runefest cx
2007scape,removed,apparently buying gp rwting is less punishing than selling lol thats actually a really good rule of which the idea behind it
2007scape,removed,why are all jmods such cunts to the people who pay them
2007scape,removed,your mother broke the rules by stopping her monthly rag system after your deadbeat father shot his grimy load into her
2007scape,removed,stfu faggot youre old news
2007scape,removed,proof mod mat k is telling the truth for once pics of him on skype admitting to scamming and over logs should ip ban this kid from runescape
2007scape,removed,you cant run away forever faggot you been doing it all your life and making online accounts to feel superior to others all those people banned but that girl still doesnt love or even like or even know of your existence xd or it doesnt change what was done to you when you were young
2007scape,removed,get lost down syndrome how much of an attentionwhore do you have to be they showed logs and more and youre still acting as if you did nothing wrong fucking ice poseidon fags
2007scape,removed,this is a test comment
2007scape,removed,lol the best part is there is no such thing as lympnotic leukemia its chronic lymphocytic leukemia
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,how to spot every retarded person in this community cx
2007scape,removed,could we ever see something similar to duel tournaments implemented in the future maybe even something external like a runescape weekly cup players enter with a gp buyin say the players are capped at which is rounds winner would get this provides a gp sink but also a competitive avenue for players each of these cups could also have specific classifications like hybriding with basic setup only fullout any gear tribrid defence category etc i have already setup something like this externally offering cashprizes wwwrunecupcom but couldnt bring advertisement to the cups is this something the community would be interested in

2007scape,removed,im not sure how you can stomach being bffs with a girl who is like years younger than you who fakes having a terminal illness if you care so much about cancer research
2007scape,removed,ya know the another way to show respect to actual cancer patients and people who are struggling is to remove cancer fakers from your game its a slap to the face to people who have lost loved ones too bad you dont see it that way and you wonder why so many people are pissed a lady in australia got exposed and is facing legal troubles
2007scape,removed,this pj timer is a fucking awful joke and thats for the retards on reddit whining about clanman mode
2007scape,removed,fuck of back to tumblr
2007scape,removed,gielinor is the whole world u idiot zeah is part of gielinor
2007scape,removed,i cant tell whether youre joking or not you sound like the guys in school who thought they were badass for going on
2007scape,removed,just remove her from the game fraud is illegal by the very nature of the activity
2007scape,removed,because you can do something doesnt mean its not absolutely idiotic you can stick your penis in an infant does mean its the smartest thing to do
2007scape,removed,ps im writing to raceforlife and cancer research uk to explain the situation on how jagex allow fraudsters to fake terminal illnesses its likely they will not accept the donations from this stream until the matter has been resolved
2007scape,removed,i think killed these fags in the fight caves one time
2007scape,removed,ha gaayyyyyyyyy
2007scape,removed,you graduated in which makes you and you speak like a year old btard im sorry lad that must be tough
2007scape,removed,no its not stop calling her a witch witch hunting a witchhunt is a search for people labelled witches or evidence of witchcraft often involving moral panic or mass hysteria fraud wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain
2007scape,removed,witchhunting is baseless emilys situation is not
2007scape,removed,holy shit this is the most pointless suggestion i have ever heard of does it really matter ffs waste of dev time
2007scape,removed,after i take my wife to work i will decompile and look through the code and i will let you guys know if its safe or not if its not i will post my findings
2007scape,removed,ahh emily got cured by toxic twitch chat
2007scape,removed,no point censoring when youre using osbuddy
2007scape,removed,not using osbuddy is a smart move
2007scape,removed,hey ill get banned for this but further proof this games run by a team of autist trying to keep the act afloat as long as possible or until they can make it after theyve faked it posers
2007scape,removed,to be fair she faked the cword its not a funny meme its a serious problem that twitch and jagex allows her to continue its fraud and fucked up
2007scape,removed,thats what they get paid to do dickface if time could be spent better elsewhere let the supervisor dictate that who are you
2007scape,removed,osbuddy thanks you for the visages
2007scape,removed,watch kids claim its cuz of bots bots probably also the reason this subreddit has more subs then ayy stay mad fags
2007scape,removed,well first things first add osbuddy to your firewall after that id suggest raising your stats so you can complete httpwwwrunehqcomoldschoolquestrecipefordisaster

2007scape,removed,it doesnt matter to you because you likely live in a place where circumcision is commonplace us and its all youve ever known why would you care since you dont know any different im uncut thanks to my mothers sanity my dad wanted me to be cut and honestly the idea of somebody taking my foreskin away from me is abhorrent have some facts a cut dick is less sensitive when not erect a penis foreskin covers the glans head keeping it moist and since thats the default for most of your life maintains a level of sensitivity proven health benefits for the average male isnt cleaner unless you dont shower but that shouldnt be something to consider how on earth is it ok to cut part of a babies sexual organ off at birth for essentially purely cosmeticreligious purposes we frown upon that for girls some fgm variants are tamer than others but not fof boys short of doagnosed medical reasons it should be an illegal procedure to have performed on males under i say all this as an uncut man in the uk ergo i dont miss my foreskin and i dont live in a country which even cares about circumcision
2007scape,removed,im a tad late to the party but we you literally said important benefits in your comment corrected to be more accurate ive listed them all over this damn thread a survey of the scientific literature on the topic published in by mayo clinic proceedings reviewed about studies published since the analysis concluded that the health benefits of male circumcision outweigh the costs specifically the study found that the chances of contracting urinary tract infections human papillomavirus hiv and other diseases were significantly reduced with circumcision httpwwwjewishjournalcomhealtharticlehealthbenefitsofcircumcisionreinforced

2007scape,removed,did you autoclick the implings
2007scape,removed,you cant hide from your auto clicking bot
2007scape,removed,why would you autoclick them
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,you didnt take into account your actual mage level since thats what void mage actually increases with its boost while we dont know the exact accuracy formula osrs uses the best approximation i can find is an increase of mage level will increase by your total mage bonus with each increase there for lets assume youre using magic potions magic lvl cause im too cheap for imbued heart using mystic might for magic accuracy and using the equipment you supplied your maximum attack role with void would be mystic att bonus maxiumum attack role with ahrims would be mystic att bonus from first blue is ahrims red is void ahrims is pretty much objectively better and it is by about but you made it sound like it was vs which is an increase of but the gap of reduces more in situations like zulrah which have high magic defence zulrah range has an effective magic defence of which means it has a maximum defence roll of so taking that into account the accuracy of void mage at mage is and accuracy of ahrims at mage is so ahrims ends up only being better but thats to be expected to a higher tier armor plus being degradable its not vs but vs note i didnt factor in the increase in max hit with the equipment setup but i think my point got across tldr ahrims is better but only by which is understandable for its extra cost
2007scape,removed,all these auto clicking comments make me giggle

2007scape,removed,nigga values scamming over his youtube reputation lol
2007scape,removed,oh im glad you actually want to have a logical discussion lets first address your point that if one man rapes his wife times its crimes for the statistic in this regard the statistics logically would show that swedish men would be overly represented as rapists because the majority of the population is swedish and according to you muslims are less likely or the same chance to commit rape there goes that one going on to your point about the death penalty for rape the quran states clearly that a womans testimony is worth half of that of a mans in court and that a man has unlimited access to sex with his wife whenever he wants so unless you are accepting the fact muslims who follow their own religion commit rape repeatedly your point i addressed above makes no sense so now onto your point that swedish has had the highest rates for years how is this relevant to the fact that in the past few years the chances for a swedish woman to be raped increased over fold does this negate the fact that the of the muslim population are total muslims its conservative to say are men especially considering refugees are usually women and children commits of the rape in of course they are labeled as non swedish because the swedish government coincidentally stopped recording nationality in i wonder why you can explain that one to me so now that ive laid out all my points i would love to hear your response obviously there will not be one as there is no answer to the truth of the matter which is that everyone in the world is not friendly and equal and culture religion affect people in a violent and negative way
2007scape,removed,dragon spear was balanced most of u never even go to the wilderness ur just babies that does the oposite of rot

2007scape,removed,youre just jealous he gets to slay mad epussy or sniff seats on the bus or something
2007scape,removed,here you go
2007scape,removed,if you cant justify a ban saying you have no interest basically means you have none then dont fucking ban you have to make up bullshit because you think streamers are going to advertise your game because its not like the good new content is going to do that for you its really pathetic how you jmods often cry about not having a large enough team yet can focus on shit like this normally when people are bullied they kinda do something about it for a streamer to be harassed or bullied maybe they should kind of stop wait no the person in question is a girl and bumps up the views on twitch thanks to her controversy since she lied about having cancer i hope your cancerous interactions with the community gives you actual cancer dropsmicimout
2007scape,removed,tfw you read a reddit post about community issues and on the list is your name with no explanation
2007scape,removed,youre a retard
2007scape,removed,or maybe and hear me out on this one but just maybe we should just ban emily
2007scape,removed,nword this nword that just say nigger you pussies
2007scape,removed,the real nigger is you ronan
2007scape,removed,there is a tendency for this subreddit to quickly become an angry mob looking for a scapegoat and they dont care if the evidence isnt fully there matt k showing a creepy favoritism towards emily is the first thing that pops into their heads to explain things so they go with it they asked for chat logs and jagex actually gave them to prove themselves oh well they could be faked give me a fucking break lol its almost cringy to see how blinded some people are by their delusions i absolutely despise emily with a passion but when you pull stupid shit around her ingame get banned and then come to the subreddit and lie to get everyone fired upthats an even bigger problem than emily
2007scape,removed,giiiiiiiimp
2007scape,removed,try eve online you wont banned for lying stealing scamming stream sniping following streamers and offensive language
2007scape,removed,fucking idiots you all know this shit is happening so you use your flawed logic to do what people are getting banned for then make posts crying about being banned fuuuuck man the logic of of this sub lmfao complete goons
2007scape,removed,look how much has to be done for them to even consider responding or you can just be a female streamer and anyone that walks by has the last years of their chat log checked retarded
2007scape,removed,fuck you racism isnt a ban you fucking cunt fucking hell you sjw piece of shit fuck the uk im seriously tired of this

2007scape,removed,fuck off you pouting drama queen
2007scape,removed,dude shut the fuck up and let it go jesus christ
2007scape,removed,better yet if he decides to ban him or whatever he should just put all of these youtube videos for the evidence httpimgurcomiecbcxg
2007scape,removed,wow i havent played rs in over a year and this all news to me you guys are morons
2007scape,removed,yeah im kind of worried that if i chop down a streamers tree theyre gonna go through my chatlogs and find chatlogs of me and my friends dungeoneering upon release and just calling eachother the n word faggot etc because we were dumb kids
2007scape,removed,youre absolutely delusional banning people for being on the same screen as this stupid bitch and then sniffing through their yearsold chat logs looking for a scapegoat reason why they got banned
2007scape,removed,ahh so were only allowed to use the most efficient methods possible is that somewhere in the rules hey stop trying to have fun only way to play this game lol nice meme dude
2007scape,removed,shut the fuck up honestly you guys are so annoying i cant imagine how you guys act in real life when a teacher tells you guys to shut the hell up because youre distracting the class do you troll them too do you think its funny yes well the rest of your class doesnt and i wont be too surprised when you decide to shoot up the school due to them not wanting to associate with you
2007scape,removed,hows my boy dardan doing retard lost his pmod for muting people hunting him rofl

2007scape,removed,shutup mod ronan you retard
2007scape,removed,the cancer is not emily not mods its you most of this community if you dont like streamer just dont go watch them and do not try to hit them in your childish why you spend your time keep hating you are the retarded idiots
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,youre fucking retarded
2007scape,removed,youre still a fucking retard lmao
2007scape,removed,youre an idiot who just admitted to every reason were outraged lol
2007scape,removed,fuck you nigger mad
2007scape,removed,reach turned gay and now does meth
2007scape,removed,rot leada nigga
2007scape,removed,how is it not runescape related u cheeky cunt ice poseidon is runescape
2007scape,removed,why didnt you do anything before he made a largely upvoted reddit post bitch
2007scape,removed,and let me guess youre one of the enlightened few who isnt mentally right
2007scape,removed,wtf do you even mean by that
2007scape,removed,twitch has no way of proving that it is her viewbotting if they were to ban her for viewbotting then people would grief top streamers with view bots to get them banned
2007scape,removed,youre talking to me like you have some preconceived idea of my opinions i literally didnt say anything on the topic youre discussing yes i agree with what youre saying they play to protect emily and its disgusting like i said i despise her and the personal attention she gets youre just another player shes a streamer that for some reason the jmods care way too much about it sounds like a joke but i genuinely believe she did something at runefest and now the jmods got her forever or at the very least mmk either way youre unimportant to jagex they only enforce the rules if it hurts their princess
2007scape,removed,why wouldnt i it takes half a minute and im able to gauge the type of person you are if i dont find that out theres no point to even reading your reply your opinion would just be worthless i was actually surprised i didnt see any meme shitposting so good on you for that at the very least you dont spread the apex of verbal autism around subreddits
2007scape,removed,i agree show us the specific racism not some random person saying nigger over and over again with the name blurred out
2007scape,removed,its not cringe to be well articulated and to write your points in an educated and coherent manner grow the fuck up
2007scape,removed,what legal trouble i really doubt that they have any case jagex can ban anyone for any reason they blurred out the names as well so the comments arent tied to any account publicly there is no way that we as players can prove whether they are or arent fake but judging by the fact that jagex banned them for bug abuse minor and refused to provide real evidence in the ban im inclined to believe that they are in fact fake chat logs jagex was already dealing with a huge pr issue so why would it be surprising that they lied to get out of it
2007scape,removed,every aspect of this is weak the kids were banned because theyre too weak to keep their online presence in check and cant handle consequences when they catch up to them mod mat k is weak for overreacting and not admitting to the obvious streamer favouritismwhich in my eyes isnt as big of a deal as people make it emily is weak for faking an extremely serious illness that has affected myself and many others and not understanding that she is a target for being a streamer but the weakest cunts of all are these fucking drama sponges that are only here to cause more shit
2007scape,removed,idiots really need to get their story together joke of a moderator team
2007scape,removed,well i know id just spank that guilty button as fast as i could so i could get back to muh gainz also i hope this wouldnt apply to macro offences cuz wed all be in the courthouse
2007scape,removed,assume it does he was telling everyone to vote no to the update cause itll hurt his income reminds me of that retarded streamer that was telling people to vote no on fightcaves and banned anyone who disagreed with him
2007scape,removed,can we get a definitive answer on what the fuck to do like i hate being spoonfed information on the internet but this is s relatively new update and as much as id like like to spend hours of my time growing and suiciding fully grown cats for the pure thrill of it id prefer someone tell me hey use this food use it on the curtain on the car dont do this rather than huh use it on the curtain bro itll help maybe fucking cafs
2007scape,removed,wow fuck jagex pile of shit favortist pieces of shit mods
2007scape,removed,get fucked fucking retard memer
2007scape,removed,stfu all the bans are well deserved if you read the chat logs who giv a fuck if they diggin thru they chat history its the same as accusing a nigga who kill someonee and finding out dey fuckin did it
2007scape,removed,stfu before i knock u out nigga none of this shit matters its a video game play yo fuckin game and dont be stupid n u wont get fuckin banned simple as shit
2007scape,removed,ex if someone broke the rule year ago they would do nothing ex if some broke the rule fucking today the same day minutes before they saw them they would be banned first offense rwt results in a temp ban spreading the most hateful racist slurs over and over results in a perm ban this means first offense rwt is less severely enforced than being the most toxic piece of shit by my calculations this post is retarded and this is some nice mental gymnastics
2007scape,removed,man keep swearing and ima have to ban you
2007scape,removed,coming from a guy named niggerorgasm lmfaooooo
2007scape,removed,nigga leave mat k alone who giv a fuck about emily you bitch ass the one that wanna fuck emily all day anyway cuz u wont stfu about her nigga play runescape and stfu before i knock u ass out
2007scape,removed,i called some kid a nigger for tbing me outside of kbd cave when i went to loot bag my stuff i then proceeded to kill him for
2007scape,removed,severe language can result in a perm ban
2007scape,removed,cos no more money from thirsty virgins
2007scape,removed,falsely lol they straight permed him because he was angry at them it wasnt an accident they banned him but once they saw how pissed people were they thought oh shit probably should unban him huh
2007scape,removed,if you look into someone history and theyve been scamming and luring people should you ban them or just say oh darn its been a month i guess youre good
2007scape,removed,she is definitely sucking at least one jmod dick
2007scape,removed,holds up mirror yall are the pathetic ones
2007scape,removed,shut the fuck up you iguana lookin motherfucker
2007scape,removed,fuck you mod pussyass ronan im so glad i dont play rs besides everybody uses racial slur to some extent
2007scape,removed,sometimes when im skilling and theres nobody about ill say some weird ass distasteful things not fuck the niggers to death more wondering out loud why my daddy touches my nono occasionally seeing what words are filtered and what arent my point is though if you just looked through my chat log at parts it could look pretty terrible and i dont think you can see how many players are around in chat logs but if nobody reported me for it then how can you argue someone has been hurt as a part of me saying those things
2007scape,removed,no fuck you dude were sick of this shit the bitch needs to get banned and youre too much of a pussy to do it
2007scape,removed,y are people pretending those people got banned for breaking the rule ages ago they literally said they were saying those things before they went by emily
2007scape,removed,nah im done already wasted enough time on this game only to get streamer favouritism ruin it and the mods be absolute retards its only going downhill so gl with it mate
2007scape,removed,well its a tough situation on the one hand people shouldnt give her attention because she is an attention whore not even an exaggeration here on the other hand if you dont give dumb people attention and call them out on their bullshit they might infect the minds of people that dont know how much of a terrible person they are you dont want a second hitler do you
2007scape,removed,this meak sense muh niga fck jaex and matkkk
2007scape,removed,all this time ive spent on my account have been fun im going to quit now i just tried deleting the other account from my authenticator but it is not letting me fun run this game gave me im going to kill myself now
2007scape,removed,not to mention the spontaneous outbursts of autism by these cx kiddies earning them reports from people around them
2007scape,removed,minor flaw kill niggers kill niggers isnt exactly minor lmfao
2007scape,removed,the fact is that ronans work at covering mmks blunder will do more harm than good were fast approaching the stage where players have to decide how pc this game can be and still be desirable to play the fact is that if you looked at the chat logs for almost any player youll find a comment that can be out of contextually used to make them look racist homophobic etc are these players actually bigots probably not its and this type of banter isnt taken as seriously as theyre making it out to be especially when the game itself has a filter if were making comparisons to other games it is tolerable for a game like league to ban you for being toxic ya it sucks to lose your account but it takes a few days to grind back to max level to play ranked this is not the case with runescape players with thousands of hours can not comfortably play with the fear of losing their accounts over out of context banter ronan is trying to qualm one fire while he simultaneously stokes another much larger one
2007scape,removed,im gay
2007scape,removed,memers picking up day bans for saying nigger in game and reddit blow up weyy its funny to see people rally behind actual toxic players just because they hate emily more
2007scape,removed,yes it is ban this faggot
2007scape,removed,cya idiot
2007scape,removed,go up to a black policemen and call him a nigger youll be instantly arrested so yes its breaking the law it can be considered as a public disturbance verbal harassment verbal abuse and is a hate crime which is most definitely illegal and you will end up in court
2007scape,removed,grow up they dont need to show evidence of every idiot they ban just to prove to the other idiots that they were rightfully banned just accept it and move on with your life do you honestly give a shit about what people do i very much doubt youd be asking your local police station why x was arrested and demand evidence it was a rightful arrest so just move on and stop fueling the hate
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,what a dumbass retard have a downvote moron
2007scape,removed,youre a fucking moron youre not entitled to a privates companies evidence this isnt a court room its their game and you have zero power they can and will ban you for whatever reason they want to if you dont like it vote with your wallet

2007scape,removed,not emily obviously faked such cancer
2007scape,removed,but muh circlejerk karma
2007scape,removed,is this really more important than me not having the freedom to spam nigger
2007scape,removed,man the cringe on the comments section almost sounds like reddit cry babies
2007scape,removed,idiot boy
2007scape,removed,jesus i hope you dont speak english as your first language its fine to make a mistake but fucking correcting people and getting wrong
2007scape,removed,that was shit fuck off
2007scape,removed,i dont care if they admit they follow her and cry because of the cancer thing that it such a tame harassment that she would be better off playing offline games instead of mmos i mean look at nearly any other mmo like wow you can kill some guy levels lower than you over and over and over literally making the game unplayable for that guy and its part of the game i wont even mention the survival games where you can destroy hours and hours of work toughen up or play single player games if emotes and words hurt her feelings so much ill let you in on a secret she doesnt really give a shit this stuff brings in money and views and she laughs at a lot of offensive shit in twitch chat along side her pussy army
2007scape,removed,put down the pitchforks you guys need lives coming from someone on the you should really think about that
2007scape,removed,the money isnt an issue its the fact that if i was a streamer jagex would be on their hands and knees sucking my dick giving me my shit back
2007scape,removed,get over yourselves only pure filth has been banned
2007scape,removed,whats good my nigger
2007scape,removed,lmfao faggot
2007scape,removed,this seriously shouldnt be punishable these people are just dressing up for fun if you think they look like the kkk then thats your problem unless they spam kill niggers these people should be free to do what they want
2007scape,removed,both of thes jmod realises seem extremely reasonable to me i would love to see emily banned but you guys need to stop nitpicking over nothing omg these two jmods said different things about the same topic omg report stfu and stop crying over nothing
2007scape,removed,lmfao fucking jagex shitters
2007scape,removed,jagex are retards my advice is just dont go maxing ur acc theyll ban it with no thought or care about how much work you put in
2007scape,removed,his account history is literally filled with luring and scamming ban this man
2007scape,removed,just being in a yard radius of that cunt gets big brother looking at everything you said since the games been out
2007scape,removed,kill yourself nigger
2007scape,removed,youre getting down votes because youre fucking retarded
2007scape,removed,are everyone on this sub children i know most of my runescape playing was when i was a child so all the ranting would make sense
2007scape,removed,nobody knows lmao but certainly not recent as i was in the cc and everyone was busy discussing emilys location and typing when something funny happened the chat logs were old irrelevant to the scenario and just an excuse to ban the people harrasing emily
2007scape,removed,rofl you said nigger as an example of disrespectful and offensive its used so much nowadays that it isnt either of those
2007scape,removed,whiteknight im sick of this sub reddit filled with shit about emily shes a cunt were all well aware of that but go make an emilybanned subreddit or something and fap there
2007scape,removed,do none of you have anything better to do than to fucking complain all day can we just drop this shit about false bans and emily stream sniping and let this subreddit be used for new content suggestions and questions instead of a circlejerky group of edge teenagers complaining at every little fucking thing they can find im pretty ashamed of the community and how its acted over the last few days can we all grow up a little bit
2007scape,removed,i feel that people who say if you want moorehehe stoof you gotta are ignorant i was for a longtime now and i feel that deserves an update to game content every now and then just because they dont doesnt mean they dont deserve anything dont be a tard some people may not have the money to actually pay this was the exact mind set of people that caused me not to pay for a long time people are stupid
2007scape,removed,people keep to themselves because of how toxic a lot of people can be in the community like ive made some great friends skilling bank standing or whatever by exchanging banter but ive also had complete idiots try and ruin my day so at the same time some people just dont want to put up with the bad stuff even if there is good to come out of it
2007scape,removed,please start deleting threads and banning the retards who are still going on about this shit you guys had your minute in the spotlight to whine about literally everything and now wed appreciate it if youd fuck off
2007scape,removed,lurenation

2007scape,removed,stfu faggot
2007scape,removed,had they been smart and listened to the right people first deadman mode would still be alive and running but as always they were too slow to fix things which led to the inevitable death of their best idea they need to add something to do for the high levels single is dead bh pking is boring if you want to make money you go to zulrah once you are maxed out combat wise and stacked with money the only goal is to level up their less relevant skills in a single boring way they need to add more minigames that are actually fun profitable and onpar with the best xp else maxed people are forced to quit eventually which endorses rwt if they just brought dungeoneering back and released sailing and a couple of minigames from itd be a great beginning but muh game engine
2007scape,removed,dude are you retarded literally every person has said stupid shit in years of playing
2007scape,removed,are you trying to be funny or are you retarded
2007scape,removed,jesus christ you guys really reach far to justify racism ive seen a lot of but muh free speech comments but people dont realize your freedom of speech isnt being taken away you have the freedom to say and do racist things in game but realize you have to pay the consequences for being a piece of shit
2007scape,removed,wow this community is full of pussies

2007scape,removed,lirik is a retard though
2007scape,removed,you also like being a retard
2007scape,removed,now they gotta search all his chatlogs untill they find something offensive he said years ago so they can ban him
2007scape,removed,no fuck off
2007scape,removed,people are fucking retarded unfortunately we have to deal with this drama bs until something happens
2007scape,removed,everyone who thinks that people got banned just for being near streamer is an idiot
2007scape,removed,just fly a plane into the jagex hq

2007scape,removed,are you kidding me youre a fucking white male
2007scape,removed,why dont we just go to cambridge and have a coup against jagex we can chop ronans head off and start an anarchosyndicalist company where we cant update anything until every single player has had a vote jagex bootlicker
2007scape,removed,the people trying to defend what theyre doing is retarded but this counterargument is even more retarded
2007scape,removed,so were not allowed have a bit of fun on rs no ones allowed play unless they play with perfect ethics the bazinga idiot got banned for being a racist piece of shit on multiple occasions and playing heavily on the cancer thing what he did on multiple occasions was legit harassment and then he cried innocent and all you mob fools got your knickers in a twist
2007scape,removed,so they should just ignore the stuff i did earlier and not do anything jesus youre not a very bright one let the actual report for that offense get processed and dealt with accordingly when did i say nothing should be done about the racist remarks i said dont use unrelated chat logs as a means to carry out bogus offenses against streamers if he was banned for harassing streamers then use evidence of him harassing the streamer chopping logs harassment stop with your retarded logic now please
2007scape,removed,once i called a kid for being a jew due to him hitting my bandos boss as ironman will i get banned now if i happend to be on the same world as emily
2007scape,removed,a ban is not always a permban so no
2007scape,removed,retarded as fuck
2007scape,removed,also top tier pussy slayer probably
2007scape,removed,they are kids school just got out what else are they going to do enjoy it for the next months fuck our lives
2007scape,removed,that is literally the job of a moderator no it isnt the job of a moderator is to enforce the rules with as little of their own subjective input as possible offensive languages which doesnt endanger the real life safety of any given player should only be punished at maximum with a permanent mute
2007scape,removed,she faked a disease that kills people every year if you dont think that deserves hate i dont know what to tell you

2007scape,removed,some of the j mods dont want whats best for the game theyre willing to shit on the community if it means a chance at some epussy
2007scape,removed,ive never liked the guy since he banned me on the official forums years ago when i played got some bullshit reason hes always sucked up to whatever players are famous it used to be the general cc people when he modded the forums a lot and now its streamers its pathetic to me that he cant do his job and he needs validation by players so much he fucks other players over to get it fuck mmk and fuck all the jagex mods who defend him and the shitty work they do
2007scape,removed,who cares the entire fucking sub for the past days idiot and it was to please emily lmao thats a fact idiot

2007scape,removed,autism
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,lmao they havent addressed shit and my conspiracy your theory is more of a conspiracy because it has less evidence is irrelevant because the issue is mat k being emilys personal bitch and finding a reason to ban people for simply doing emotes this shouldnt be allowed and the mods agreed idiot also im not assuming the mods are lieing im assuming that mat k isbased off of evidence whilst admitting nobody knows the truth again the evidence strongly points towards me being correct and thats all we have to go off in a court of law i would be correct and you would be incorrect there is a reason the shitstorm happened and there is a reason you are in the minority you are an idiot and simply adamant on defending jagex no matter what to the point where you will ignore evidence lmao its pathetic
2007scape,removed,its like youre retarded
2007scape,removed,why not
2007scape,removed,holy shit youre just saying what i said in a different way thats the problem they only got looked into because of that which shouldnt fucking happen you shouldnt get looked into because a jmod has a boner for a girl streamer they should have been banned before from being reported legit from players they actually harassed what about this do you not understand youre probably the dumbest retard ive ever seen reply on a comment thinking your hot shit when you have no idea what im talking about
2007scape,removed,why is it that every topic i go to theres always idiots like you that have to nutride jagex fyi they only care about your money princess
2007scape,removed,can we ban this prick already
2007scape,removed,because not everyone is sucha newfag like u
2007scape,removed,this method is only used in unison with specific runescape streamers if you dont log into the same world and area as some specific streamers then your chat logs will not be meticulously picked apart for damning evidence to ban you d hope this helped
2007scape,removed,guy is a douchebag no doubt but he shouldnt be banned

2007scape,removed,emily is a streamer who is known for viewbotting and faking have cancer this subreddit always hates on her note im not supporting her either
2007scape,removed,she is just a shitty streamer i wouldnt say she has power basically her stream is pretty cringe and people want her to be perm banned for having a cringey stream even though that isnt a bannable offense she also rwted once and received a two week ban which is supposedly the normal punishment for buying gold but people want her to be punished more she really doesnt have an impact on anyone who doesnt watch her streams but people just really dislike her for no good reason the other problem is that some people have harassed her in game and gotten perm banned even though most people who bother others dont get banned so people complain about streamer favoritism jmods wanting booty tldr she is a really shitty streamer people think she should be banned for that even though it doesnt make sense
2007scape,removed,the people who do this like streamers are some kind of ascended godlike beings are morons the only proof ive seen in this thread a link to another post in this sub is faker than the advertisements i get to get a cheap loan
2007scape,removed,you are retarded is it coincidence that everyone else who was banned today had the exact same thing

2007scape,removed,oh yeah lol i forgot to mention the lying about cancer deal i agree that she is a cancerous metaphorically not literally and shitty streamer it is just that idk how her being a cunt in real life is a bannable offense im not trying to defend her at all she is cancer i just think she should be completely irrelevant to of rs players
2007scape,removed,burn her
2007scape,removed,i will try to keep this as brief as i can i went to the ge to resupply and i was met with a lurer i knew i was being lured and i wanted to go along with it and get him ban like what a friend did with the scammer while we were still the ge someone named poo dragon came to me and was trying to tell me i was being lured but i already knew he told me to look up fast coins in short time on youtube for the antilure little did i know he was the lurers friend and i was social engineered into believing that poo dragon was trying to help me eventually i got lured and lost my bank which was my tassets and i learned my lesson to never try to antilure as chances are i will still get fucked in the end nbsp i know i was stupid for this and i am hoping people can learn from my mistake and hopefully these two get what they deserve in the mean time dont try to antilure its not worth it chances are youre being played oh another thing this lure is not patched dont fall for it as i did
2007scape,removed,they shud not get anything done to them just for messing with some retarded streamer jagex is in the wrong if this is real
2007scape,removed,transfer your items asap matty k wakes up at am and will rush into jag hq to ban you once he finds out you harassed one of the many female streamers he follows seriously check his twitch to see who he follows its kinda funny

2007scape,removed,rwt and abusing her position with the mods to ban other players from the game most noble of all her deeds would be when she faked cancer for attentiondonations and then proceeded to delete and deny everything
2007scape,removed,yes it is i am just learning now as well maybe its her in game but apparently this happens all the time she whines to jmods who ban for her immediately i guess she also lied and said she had cancer just for donations sounds like a cunt from what ive heard but again im just learning this all now as well
2007scape,removed,if this is legit then thats fucking stupid jagex is a bunch of downys sometimes i will kill anyone in wilderness how am i supposed to know if its a streamer or not and who doesnt flame when they kill someone its a game and people get a little competitive our players dont have to be so sensitive now on the other hand if he was constantly finding them and steam sniping and constantly flaming then thats different and if thats the case i love you jagex
2007scape,removed,mat k gets emotional when his e gf gets bulied

2007scape,removed,she actually draws cat whiskers in her face jesus fucking christ is he really that desperate for below average pussy
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,i honestly think this is going too far harassing mmk like that
2007scape,removed,horrible streamer that faked cancers moderators of runescape permanently ban players that harass her hence is making fun of both of them
2007scape,removed,their shouldnt be any politically correct bs bans in the game whatsoever this is why there are things like the ignore optionfucking idiots
2007scape,removed,doesnt like ice poseidon what he literally has said multiple times he wishes he streamed in uk time because he loves the streams fucking idiot lol
2007scape,removed,so is being bald in runescape banned

2007scape,removed,i sincerely hope mod mat k would get cancer so they could cry it out together with the uglyfuck am not kidding
2007scape,removed,damn white knights everywhere but theyll always be virgins bro
2007scape,removed,it was return of wilderness but the cunt got banned you out of luck unless someone saved it
2007scape,removed,i think youre handicapped mentally my friend
2007scape,removed,e pussy rs player base
2007scape,removed,my girlfriend was messing around with my game on me when i was walking from the catherby fishing spot to the bank she said jew by itself along with some gibberish beforehand it got me a mute that i could not appeal i also got a mute back in because i told someone they could swear after they took the filter out
2007scape,removed,i honestly hope this is fake if not i have lost all hope for the fuck boy jmods that are running the show they are shitting on us
2007scape,removed,thats a pretty fucking absurd implication you pulled out of nowhere i dont see how kek translates to that
2007scape,removed,nice meme cx
2007scape,removed,you sure got him good retard
2007scape,removed,umodmatk if this isnt an abuse of your power with evidence included i dont know what is extremely disappointed in you mate been an alltime favorite moderator by many a people including me whats going on
2007scape,removed,can umodmatk be stripped of his jagex moderator privileges hes obviously abusing them for his perverted fantasies for a cancer faker that still has not been banned mods dont delete this youll only be adding fuel to the fire
2007scape,removed,he puts the pussy on the pedal stool
2007scape,removed,the osrs team is bringing me back to the days when private servers were ran and dominated by power hungry year olds and they would ban you for even killing them
2007scape,removed,if you had blond hair and a flat chest which you call boobs then yes you can get mat k to ban them
2007scape,removed,ive called mat k an idiot since day and i used to get mass downvoted for it now finally everyone knows what an idiot he truly is
2007scape,removed,doesnt take a genius to figure out what people are trying to do by copying her character and having a bald head though they are tying to harass her
2007scape,removed,i totally agree silent did nothing wrong by killing that ragger they are literally the most cancerous thing on this game nothing of value would be lost if they were gone that being said why do people feel the need to keep giving this attention whore exactly what she wants like we all know its silly to ban someone for simply standing next to someone doing an emote but at the end of the day its probably some cancerous little twitch memer anyway so nothing of value was lost
2007scape,removed,mad at the cuntery idjit
2007scape,removed,just look at the list of streams that he follows httpswwwtwitchtvmodmatkprofilefollowing the man is a deranged pervert and is taking it out on innocent players
2007scape,removed,game gonna get ruined for some stinky pussy lol
2007scape,removed,youre a fucking moron
2007scape,removed,mmks daughter is named emily spread the word
2007scape,removed,if they just banned her for all her wrong doing everything would be fine
2007scape,removed,i dont get why youre being down voted to warrant a perm ban op must have done so much more than hes leading on despite what the idiots in this subreddit think
2007scape,removed,imagine if she was attractive that modmat guy would lose his fuckin virgin mind really hope he dies too be sure to text him in the morning hopefully he reads it and drifts into traffic
2007scape,removed,how do you figure i can call her a whore here all i want she wont get any views or money from me seems like a winlose
2007scape,removed,shes a streamer with cancer
2007scape,removed,its pathetic in cases like this years of work down the drain because some jmod has their priorities wrong the pic pretty much proved streamer favouritism harrasing streamers not players
2007scape,removed,hope his kids dont find out their dads an edating pussy cant ever groud them again
2007scape,removed,lol do it pussy
2007scape,removed,mod mat k is a pedophile piece of shit he needs to be shoved off a bridge
2007scape,removed,gimme dat e pussy
2007scape,removed,dont mind me testing if shadowbanned or just the post was removed
2007scape,removed,dude that tranny streamer is better looking than emily lmfao
2007scape,removed,truthfully i havent played this game in years and just felt like shitposting a bit because you guys managed to hit the front page kind of sad about the game though cant believe you idiots play a game that will get you banned for following a stupid whore who lied about getting cancer
2007scape,removed,are you autistic
2007scape,removed,this entire circlejerk is honestly fucking pathetic if people just ignored this fucking cancer faking piece of cunt shit none of this shit would happen
2007scape,removed,geiger counters are useless for cats though they should instead make a quest that makes of chip the account of that certain streamer and have us upgrade the catspeak amulet e to a catspeak amulet ccl where ccl stands for chronic lymphocytic leukemia this amulet will autotele you to the stray dog in varrock for safety when you get too close to the chipped account anywhere on gielinor after the quest requirements crafting slayer hitpoints a tail of two cats
2007scape,removed,too bad little cat bitch is above all rules
2007scape,removed,hes a product manager they are all idiots who are so far up their own asses that they actually believe what they do is worth what they get paid for they are talentless hacks with a god complex for the most part
2007scape,removed,never trade anything to anyone that you wouldnt be willing to give to them for free
2007scape,removed,til op is a cunt
2007scape,removed,mfw
2007scape,removed,mods starting banning players for harassing streamers the harassment consisted of killing streamers in the wild following streamers around with questionable outfit choices ie dressed similarly but bald to denote said player hasis cancer and crashing streamers at gwd
2007scape,removed,they can censor my thread but theyll never censor the overall feeling of the community emily is a cunt
2007scape,removed,get a fucking life honestly
2007scape,removed,fuck the mods
2007scape,removed,its a post on a subreddit not an english exam writing it hastily isnt gonna kill me
2007scape,removed,he said jagex are lil dick virgin cuckolds thats wives prob got slammed by bbc right before their eyes
2007scape,removed,lol this awful subreddit isnt supposed to be some bastion of free speech mods just want the place looking somewhat respectable despite the hoards of cancerous virgins smearing shit all over the walls all the clever posts made it through anyway
2007scape,removed,ooh that girl how did twitch not ban her already if all these things are right about modmatk then he is one desperate pathetic neckbeard im gonna google him now really curious about what he and his wife look like
2007scape,removed,stop complaining pussy exp waste
2007scape,removed,yeah the better alternative is to just ignore the problem and allow the jmods to ban anybody who comes close to harassing their little ewhore
2007scape,removed,no sorry its like a full moon i occasionally act stupid when autistic children reply to my posts really got out of hand this time you must be something special
2007scape,removed,fucking old cunt
2007scape,removed,start streaming and then go scam ppl and if ppl call you out for it just ask mod matk to ban them for you problem solved
2007scape,removed,you will mate bug abuse minor
2007scape,removed,we aint obsessed with her you goddam moron do you actually know anything the ugly fuck mmk is the obsessed one noone gives a flying fuck about her until people start getting banned for doing absolutly nothing idiot
2007scape,removed,cant login if we are banned for walking near another player in a mother fucking mmorpg do you even know what that stands for idiot
2007scape,removed,pls maek it hapen i dun wana risk my acunt i invest many minutes in support
2007scape,removed,please leave your sjw bull shit out of this nigger
2007scape,removed,mod mat k wants to get that pussy bruh
2007scape,removed,someone just needs to doxx her and go do what needs be done
2007scape,removed,god what a dumb bitch boohoo muh feelings nobody cares about your feelings
2007scape,removed,recently there seem to be a lot of posts about an streamer emily in the top posts of all anybody give me the tldr of the situation thanks in advance
2007scape,removed,im with you man ill ride these downvotes with you just so you know youre not alone
2007scape,removed,fuck you nigga better to be proactive rather than reactive the system has flaws and its not perfect voicing that doesnt make you a pussy it just makes you aware now kindly go fuck yourself
2007scape,removed,lil gay boi
2007scape,removed,aw boohoo a girl dislikes being followed in an mmo thats her problem not anyone elses
2007scape,removed,thats the jist emily is notoriously disliked because she took the cam whoring to another level as one person said her stream is normally cam game and mods have banned people for treating her just like any other player by killing her in pvp areas or by using the same boss area as herthis is rude but not against the rules
2007scape,removed,is this a bot no its not do u even know what a bot is or how they work youre a fucking idiot
2007scape,removed,then youre a fucking retard
2007scape,removed,good thing we dont have to go to prison when we kill someone in runescape idiot
2007scape,removed,i mean i dont tell emily to go die or anything but if she broke a in game rule and its bannable they should have banned her considering other players did and faux is staking for other people yet they didnt do anything about that yet if a average player did that insta ban emily knew the risks but i guess she also knew mat was her dog
2007scape,removed,yes they do people join her channel and troll fuck around with her ingame just ignore the dumb bitch and let her become irrelevant
2007scape,removed,please this is for real im so disgusted by the fact this animal is a mod in my fov game look at who he follows in twitch its disgusting how fucking desperate he is for young girls attention a slave has more dignity i cant believe im playing osrs for years and i might lose my account and all it has for a stupid fucking reason like by a mod that abuses his power i swear to god this is just disgusting if i see him in the street i honestly might just start a fight with him so fucking disgusted by this old pussy slave peace of shit
2007scape,removed,are you brain dead i commented here calling the lying now deleted op a douchebag for ragging people this has nothing to do with me or the way i play i enjoy the fact that you spend your time looking through low traffic comments trying to start shit blocked so i wont see any responses not that your words are of any value to anybody on the sub til there are actually imbred humans that gear up to do clue steps
2007scape,removed,no matter how much u defend emily she aint gonna suck yo dick bro
2007scape,removed,lol
2007scape,removed,u suck
2007scape,removed,yeah right and i am donald duck i also know mod ronan likes boys however i simply cant cant bring myself to publicise something so horrendous
2007scape,removed,riot on the discord invite link
2007scape,removed,nice damage control you pathetic cuck
2007scape,removed,httpsiimgurcomcggyiszjpg
2007scape,removed,you suck
2007scape,removed,permenant ban tho i mean really i dont give a fuck if he was cursing god you dont ban him like that mute him perm maybe but make that much of an account go byebye because we are a very not toxic community yeah right better ban around half the community perm then this is a game not a fucking church a perm ban you say look at mod mat k twitch channel and who he follows motherfucker is a pussy slave
2007scape,removed,i usually try to stay out of this whole emily stuff because its the largest circlejerk that this sub has ever seen but i do have one question you claim that you ban users who are toxic spread racism hatred and abuse throughout the game yet you have this streamer who lied publicly about having a disease for attention donations etc who is still allowed to play your game she has certain moderators wrapped around her finger with her notepad and i assume forwards that list to you and action is taken emily is probably one of the most toxic players in this community and she absolutely knows what power she has and openly abuses it
2007scape,removed,but we simply cant bring ourselves to publicise something so horrendous bullshit dont be a fucking pussy and post it as proof
2007scape,removed,mat is a creepy old pervert who has no place on the oldschool team this response is the biggest pile of bullshit ive ever read if you have proof then show us dont use we cant bring ourselves to post it as an excuse thats pathetic
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,with his personal twitch are all you retards blind he has extra interest in her
2007scape,removed,then why do you welcome scumbags who fâkς cåncér to the community and comply to their every demand you want the community to get better then deal with the bitch and take your heads out your asses you are only lessening the communitys opinion of you by ignoring the issue and giving her special treatment
2007scape,removed,yet at the same time all this was happening the single team known as brap was caught ddosing their own member for an ags max mage on video all those people in that video arent banned yet if that was a streamer being ddosed they would be perm banned instantly with that video going live sort it out jagex these people in brap are ddosing and getting away with it because wiggled is a part of their team and protecting them
2007scape,removed,imagine defending someone who faked cancer
2007scape,removed,just done the same fuck modmatkuck
2007scape,removed,then why do you welcome scumbags who an infections disease sorry cucks on this reddit filter the phrase to the community and comply to their every demand you want the community to get better then deal with the bitch and take your heads out your asses you are only lessening the communitys opinion of you by ignoring the issue and giving her special treatment
2007scape,removed,holy shit this just shows how fucking stupid you guys are
2007scape,removed,aka emily brings in fellow grills lets not cuck her
2007scape,removed,then why do you welcome scumbags who sorry cucks on this reddit filter the phrase to the community and comply to their every demand you want the community to get better then deal with the bitch and take your heads out your asses you are only lessening the communitys opinion of you by ignoring the issue and giving her what she wants
2007scape,removed,without concrete evidence and showing the public what was actually said in the chat logs you guys are no better than nazi germanys gestapo throwing people in jail for accused crimes without evidence
2007scape,removed,that kind of faggotry is what made me leave runescape in the first place theyre just words
2007scape,removed,chemo squad assemble
2007scape,removed,the thing i hate about this fucking situation is that you the moderators spend your time banning people for being toxic on stream yet you do nothing about people scamming botting or luring around runescape fuck you and fuck your white knight bitch of a co worker
2007scape,removed,wont be long before someone who naturally has his hair bald is doing a clue scroll near emily that requires him to use the cry emote and hes instabanned by mod prat k
2007scape,removed,this is filtered info they lie to get you to believe what you want retard
2007scape,removed,can you please address why emilys history of rule breaking was not taken as seriously as people disrupting her gameplay shes had a pretty toxic impact on the community shes confessed her intent to fake being hacked for gold donations and rwt
2007scape,removed,youre an actual moron
2007scape,removed,are you fucking kidding me youre a moron
2007scape,removed,post the chat logs you morons youre just trying to cover mmk cause you guys know he fucked up
2007scape,removed,youre a fucking moron then grown the fuck up and stop complaining
2007scape,removed,cuckronan
2007scape,removed,cucks
2007scape,removed,ye kill all the nonautists who can make friends
2007scape,removed,what is this emily business thats going on is she a streamer whos dating a jmod has jäger said anything
2007scape,removed,shove that gay ass bear meme up your anus and go back to
2007scape,removed,i honestly feel bad for mmk what type of a creepy lonely spastic do you have to be to be so hopelessly retarded when it comes to a soft
2007scape,removed,if she didnt want to be followed by people then dont become a fucking streamer you moron
2007scape,removed,bald heads and cry emotes at the ready boys
2007scape,removed,i dont like emily or mat k but youre a fucking spastic kid
2007scape,removed,beating sense into retarded year olds like yourself white knighting okay buddy

2007scape,removed,bullshit no deal show chatlogs as matter of fact the so called accused should have the chat logs but you idiots didnt include them why hmmmmm i smell mod mat ks big fuck up
2007scape,removed,and you seem like a beta male faggot cy
2007scape,removed,heil mods
2007scape,removed,she was diagnosed cx
2007scape,removed,no im thinking critically and using logic i dont like emily and i dont support her in any way but to any given retard on this sub lately not mindlessly hating emily and jagex sjw cuck this sub has reached thedonald levels of down syndrome the past couple days
2007scape,removed,i want to know if mod matt k gets something in return for being emilys pet does she send him her dirty undies or something
2007scape,removed,gay zyzz fuarkkkkk brah
2007scape,removed,thatll only get rid of verbal harassment people were raggingintentionally crashing emily multiple times also pking her which is apparently also under the harassment rule i think what the pkers fucked up on was the verbal abuse if repeatedly crashing a person isnt something that warrants a ban then its normally the verbal abuse that follows it yes they can use the ignore list but realistically all that does is shut down conversation until white knight mat k comes and bans them for harassment
2007scape,removed,stop trying youre embarrassing yourself mister white knight
2007scape,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if it turns out the be just like all the other times this has happened and it turns out the victim has been abusingtrolling for people for months and not just what they decide to show
2007scape,removed,i have created a subreddit that is uncensored if anyone is interested httpswwwredditcomrfreeosrs
2007scape,removed,never created an r before but if you want uncensored this may interest some of you httpswwwredditcomrfreeosrs
2007scape,removed,just show the evidence you fucking pussy
2007scape,removed,fuck you ronan kys we arent babies post the fucking chat logs or this looks like complete bullshit
2007scape,removed,based on posts on this retarded sub ive formed the opinion that youre all retarded
2007scape,removed,the bitch literally lied for donations and wasnt banned then now normal people can get banned doing nothing around her what happens when a player who doesnt watch streams crashes her or kills her in the wildy or god forbid does an emote near her fuck mod matt
2007scape,removed,dunno if youre interested but ive created an uncensored r httpswwwredditcomrfreeosrs
2007scape,removed,mod mat k how old are you honestly late early and there you are sitting on twitch making sure your little dream girlfriend doesnt get harassed by players she has falsely led on with her bullshit what are you getting out of it other then hate do you enjoy being a fucking beta white knight lil cunt do you realise what you are promoting what you are sticking up for some sadistic bitch who has rwted not been perm banned made some bullshit excuse for that one has faked a disease lets not forget about that zomoor shit where he exposed her with his teamspeak recording of her saying shes going to scamhussle players for gp what point are you trying to prove here harassment is not okay quick little google search of the definition of harassment covers a wide range of behaviours of an offensive nature it is commonly understood as behaviour which disturbs or upsets and it is characteristically repetitive in the legal sense it is behaviour which appears to be disturbing or threatening so her behaviour toward the community isnt harassment itself grow the fuck up do something about her give the players the justice they want instead of giving us excuses of why she hasnt been banned yet at the end of the day youre some pathetic little white knight fantasizing over shit that is never going to happen oh but shes a girl get over it do something and watch the players stop the more you beat around the bush the worse it gets

2007scape,removed,lol youre retarded the fact that they had to wait for these players to do something to emily to ban them is beyond me and i doubt majority of it is true its just mod ronan helping mat k justify his white knight
2007scape,removed,theyre funny to watch they think theyre so smart but theyre actually being completely retarded theyre like a little kid youre letting win hide n seek even though they suck just letting them have their moment and laughing at them
2007scape,removed,this is what happens when the cucks take control
2007scape,removed,what the fuck is wrong with people like you why is it that every person who takes the rational and nonbiased standpoint is called a white knight around here is it because youre too fucking retarded to actually make a proper counterargument or what
2007scape,removed,you can choose not to play the game hes a jmod on the game i too would like to see proof but at the same time the tos explicitly states accounts are sole property of jagex and if you are abusing the privilege of being allowed to play he doesnt owe you shit

2007scape,removed,ronan doesnt help emily cause he can get pussy better than hers

2007scape,removed,we dont want to post something so horrendous aka we have fuck all evidence
2007scape,removed,just perm ban the cancerous whore and everything will be fine
2007scape,removed,lol ive only just gotten back into osrs and the entire community is cancer this emily person is just an outright bitch she reported someone because she was mad grow the fuck up the amount of scammers ingame is disgusting the amount of bots ingame is disgusting im getting private messages if my private chat is on from spammers trying to sell me gold what the fuck happened and why is jagex not on top of these rule breakers seems to me like they just dont care i even had a scammer ask me to join his scam group because he has been successful he told me he has been reported before and hasnt been banned he admitted to scamming yet nothing has happened something needs to happen real soon about all this bullshit thats going on or im out fuck this corruption and lack of moderation in the time ive been playing since i got back to rs ive seen pmods both on world never seen a jmod clearly you guys jagex are understaffed and you need to start promoting players who follow the rules because its getting out of hand im at the point where i have public chat off because you cant have a decent conversation without someone trying to scam insult or generally harass you oh and streamer favoritism is fucked
2007scape,removed,weve been banning players for harassing others for years this is nothing new it has allowed us to remove a lot of truly toxic individuals from the community when will you start banning people for wishing cancer and rape upon others this i believe should be your main priority not protecting a certain streamer
2007scape,removed,ok either mod mat k is a year old virgin hoping emily will fuck him if he babysits her like this or hes a year old virgin hoping emily will flash her tits for him if he babysits her like this either way mod mat k is a sad cunt if you dont want people using emotes dont put emotes into the game in the first place jesus fucking christ
2007scape,removed,what is this the worldwide virgin meet up
2007scape,removed,change your characters to bald women and cry en masse in falador we cannot get mod microdiks attention if we dont have a cancer faking vagina
2007scape,removed,you ban people on runescape for party evidence she also harasses players over her livestream shes incredibly rude and slanders the names of other streamers also shes tried to dox me which would be asking for real life details and threatened to sue people or get them banned reallife threats also rwted do something shes tearing this entire community apart its of the community that wants her gone even in your terms is passing how easy and less toxic would this game just be if person who has caused all this was banned idiots i love u jed cx

2007scape,removed,ive never even played runescape and i came here from rall but even i can tell that this is a fucking bullshit canned answer response if youre going to spout pandering bullshit at least make it convincing
2007scape,removed,there is one way to solve this just like the joker said all we have to do is kill the batman its simple ban the streamer would say name but afraid of getting banned
2007scape,removed,you literally showed facts in this post absolutely fucking ridiculous display of customer interaction by jagex i think a lot of people here thinking along the same line the people we saw get banned for doing emotes next to emily have not done these offences you are claiming they have and simply were banned because mmk seems to have an overprotective infatuation with the girl
2007scape,removed,ive been playing osrs for about month now and this is like my second time being on this subreddit quick question though is there any examples of emily trying to get some easy money out of horny guys i mean examples of girls just using the cam for money exists like legendarylea celeste etc but those girls always have revealing clothing even having numerous accidents on stream from what ive seen from emily i have only seen her stream times shes not one of those that just wear a tshirt smaller than her bra and does yoga infront of the camera i mean the most ive seen from her is the nose and whiskers painted on but thats not even close to the thing youre accusing her of now im not saying youre wrong im just ignorant cause ive never seen any of her stream and would like some proof because women have it hard enough trying to play games without year old virgins calling them trash because the girl streamer wont fuck them its really disgusting to call a girl something like cam whore etc just because they wear a top they think is cute or because they dont actively try to look like a bag of shit then again its a honest question because i really dont know anything about her or her streams
2007scape,removed,stay away from a streamer called emily if u value ur account
2007scape,removed,dont go near female streamers or you might get banned cx
2007scape,removed,angry at op want to join the mob ive got you covered come on down to rpitchforkemporium i got em all traditionalleft handedfancy eǝ i even have discounted clearance forks offmanufacturers defect fle new in stock directly from liechtenstein european models the eurothe poundthe lira €£₤ happy lynching some assembly required
2007scape,removed,beware of the streamer
2007scape,removed,keep twitch open on the side and avoid female streamers
2007scape,removed,dont watch emilys stream or contact it ingame you will get brutally banned
2007scape,removed,thats not what a pedophile is lmao
2007scape,removed,something like that the trolling in this case is doing emote next to the streamer absolutely harmless and in no way interruptive also there was a video of a player that was a fan of the say streamer who have donated to say streamer getting banned for doing literally nothing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzwyeuxvbbpk then you have this pr post that say the players were banned for racist remark and not for doing emote next to the streamer then why are the ban report say the player are banned for harassing streamer and not racist remark and they are not going to release the chatlog that can backup jagexs racisthatred accusation statement in this post because its too horrendous for the players most of the player are adults so shit have really hit the fan
2007scape,removed,wow careful lad shes jewish remember that could really offend someone
2007scape,removed,nah hes just a creepy old man
2007scape,removed,following a female on on a streaming website who is nowhere near a minor doesnt make you a pedophile
2007scape,removed,yes
2007scape,removed,too far
2007scape,removed,you seriously cant make these accusations and im pretty sure you can even get sued for this well now you did it anonymously online its gonna be almost impossible of course
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,nah hes just a white knight
2007scape,removed,op is obviously not serious chill out people
2007scape,removed,u retarded
2007scape,removed,mat banned them for doing emotes around emily shitstorm occurred scanned their chatlogs to cover his ass very very unprofessional
2007scape,removed,first they came for the communists and i did not speak out because i was not a communist then they came for the socialists and i did not speak out because i was not a socialist then they came for the trade unionists and i did not speak out because i was not a trade unionist then they came for the jews and i did not speak out because i was not a jew then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me
2007scape,removed,tldr thank you jagex for banning innocent people who harrased cancer faker
2007scape,removed,shes pure cancer she has no remorse for her past actions shes a pathological liar and a crybaby she view bots with no negative consequence and shes treated better than the average player by jagex mods

2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,she committed theft against rs players thats directly affecting the game people have been arrested for making threats on this game before that werent directly related to any content youd think itd be in the best interest of the company to ban her
2007scape,removed,ronan you are just as pathetic as mat now to me
2007scape,removed,recently several players were banned for repeatedly harassing a number of people within the community we want to make one thing clear in this post the actions of these players were completely unacceptable and we will not tolerate racism or harassment in old school runescape fuck you and your joke of a company you all are fucking cucks
2007scape,removed,if you play old school runescape youll get falsely banned if you play youll get a hole in your wallet

2007scape,removed,fyi open in incognito browser if your blocked by the cunt
2007scape,removed,when you lack skill socially like he does because of a condition aspergerautismlack of confidence a reallllllly hot girl or many hot girls could tell you that you are insanely hot and you would still question it its not about being humble or not being aware of the fact that hes liked by the community but more of a mental problem that leaves him with a lack of self confidence
2007scape,removed,youre an idiot oldschool was never meant to stay it was intended to go a different route then the disaster that eoc was if you honestly think is better then thats fine youre wrong but its fine youll find the same amount of scammersspammers website sellers there as you would here thats an undeniable fact
2007scape,removed,no you are retarded

2007scape,removed,why havent i been banned yet ban me please
2007scape,removed,wanted a membership paid with my bucks ran into emily banned by mod mat kuck
2007scape,removed,yes also we need a forcefield around every streamer which bans anyone that comes in range this is the only logical choice as it follows with jagexs own logic
2007scape,removed,exactly even if he did say harassing things at one point thats not why he was banned people run around saying harassing things all over the game jagex is just using it as an excuse so they can ban people
2007scape,removed,one less idiot to worry about

2007scape,removed,ban the witch
2007scape,removed,everything you have posted here is severely retarded yes things happen in circlejerk cycles here on this sub but this topic has be around for awhile and needed to be addressed the last time there was a huge circlejerk about emily was the rwt week ban where other users clearly would have been perm banned or had a longer ban and now this criticismcirclejerk is completely justified as well ive never gone into emilys streams and talked shit ive been in there like times and never said anything bad to her but you just cant go around and fucking write names into your handydandy notebook from blues clues and get people banned and perm banned thats fucking retarded shes not even that big of a streamer and she allegedly viewbots her numbers too plenty of other streamers who are bigger in other games do not get that special treatment and power to affect other players thats bombastically retarded
2007scape,removed,this degenerate twat thinks shes almighty
2007scape,removed,f that cx
2007scape,removed,yeah yeah yeah fagex can do whatever the fuck they want because its their game except if they expect players to continue to support their decisions they should probably consider not acting like the staff of a runescape private server and show some restraint
2007scape,removed,bug abuse ban for offensive language the facts they werent even banned in the right category the facts there are no facts or evidence in here its just your word emily had been getting away for pretending to have cance there is countless evidence and she has yet to be banned
2007scape,removed,yeahhh you downvote me then delete your account and thread pussy
2007scape,removed,catering to the only female that plays their game virgins
2007scape,removed,another baseless comment from you nice so fucking ironic you say this while you comment meaningless things with zero content just delete you fucking account lol
2007scape,removed,why is there a kkk outfit then fagex
2007scape,removed,op was banned lmfao fuck you mods
2007scape,removed,its really sad that the mods still continue to cater to someone who is keenly aware of her special treatment to the point of joking about it with the notepad and taunting people who dont like her because she has the power to erase them from the game mat must be very lonely or just a moron to religiously ban people whom she does not like
2007scape,removed,would fit right in rpunchablefaces
2007scape,removed,in the words of rthedonald pathetic
2007scape,removed,mod mat k looks like the goblin he has as his avatar
2007scape,removed,apparently white mystic robes are also kkk robes this guy is a fucking idiot and hes trying to save face
2007scape,removed,yeah its so cute lol xd if you actually think jagex would get away with doing something like that or that its cringe xd to take legal action over a gaming company for doing illegal shit youre retarded
2007scape,removed,she literally knows she has mmk wrapped around her little finger pretty disgraceful
2007scape,removed,emilyisrwt cx
2007scape,removed,umodmatk has pampered her too much now look at the spoilt bitch thinking she is better than everyone if this is the sort of people you are going to protect then we are entitled to be mad

2007scape,removed,modmatk best white knight
2007scape,removed,then just dont vote on the poll you spastic
2007scape,removed,are you retarded
2007scape,removed,jagex you want this to stop do as op says and also ban that fucking bitch you honestly want a person to advertise your game that has made fun of a disease and broken your own rules your rules allow you to ban her rwt
2007scape,removed,be glad you dont have one youd get hacked faster than mods can ban you for making this status
2007scape,removed,oh look mods shadow removed my comment

2007scape,removed,lad douchebag if youre a neckbeard
2007scape,removed,i wasnt youre a condescending ass why would i want to keep talking to you
2007scape,removed,can you be any more of a meme first of all jagex arent a fucking government but you dont understand government anyway jagex privately own this game they do what they want the government works for us the government works for all not just some group with the same interests as you if someone you dont like is getting harassed they step in for that person whether you like it or not they arent there to please your whims if enough of us warrant interest they have to oblige to our demands not necessarily the government is meant to do whats fair not meet the demands of peasants at the expense of others even if that other is just one again they arent there to please your whims theyre there to instill fairness in society question everything your life must suck if you do this there are many things that are so obvious they dont need questioned question the government question why they are or arent doing things this is how we keep the government in check by not questioning them or protesting them were allowing them power and making us seem like pushovers of course you should be skeptcal of things but they way you morons say shit like this is retarded as if the government is just out to get you for some insipid reason the only thing that needs questioned is if theres a brain under your skull

2007scape,removed,he answered that in the fucking post idiot
2007scape,removed,holy fuck this subreddit is retarded
2007scape,removed,dude he is a fucking clown good observation
2007scape,removed,assuming hours
2007scape,removed,defending people just being retarded on stream like this guy httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzwyeuxvbbpk
2007scape,removed,youre full of shit ronan do me a favor and drink some fucking bleach the osrs team only needs ash you know the guy who basically does fucking everything
2007scape,removed,hello newish to this sub who is this emily person everyone keeps taking about
2007scape,removed,oh shut the fuck up youre just like emily
2007scape,removed,i would have to hop about every half hour trying to backlight due to people flowering me people pk me when im making nats for the only purpose of deriving enjoyment from inconveniencing me people crash me when i slay just to be a cunt when i did black sallys i got pked multiple times there for fucks sakes ignore if you have to and hop you cant remove crashing from the game or even make harassment banable because the line for what constitutes that changes depending on your perspective players have plenty of options to address the situation and deal with it the community ultimately needs to regulate itself which it does for the most part and thats fine as much as i hate the people who crash me id be pissed if they were banned for it maybe emily gets a little extra of this than most that is a reflection of the shitty way she has acted and continues to act maybe if she had a bit of humility and formally apologized to the community for doing something almost everyone would think is truly reprehensible it wouldnt be as bad but regardless the standards shouldnt change just because someone streams a game they especially shouldnt change to cater to someone that is objectively human garbage because a jmod very unprofessionally pervs on female streamers
2007scape,removed,you are an attention whore and you like drama you said so he or he she might not say it but youre a complete waste of space jack ass honestly go back to lol and rot and i see you pussy edited your posts the false shit that comes out your mouth why did you feel need to resort to racism what did that have to do with anything cunt

2007scape,removed,ive never really had an opinion of emily but all this shit going on recently really makes me resent her not only is she a whiny bitch but shes entitled her voice is worse than nails on a chalk board and those fucking cat whiskers just simply are stupid and childish she needs to grow the fuck up has she ever thought that people crashing and harassing her those that actually qualify is a result of her own actions thousands of people dont hate you and want to make you suffer for no reason if you ask me she has had this coming and all this is under the bullshit preface that is the fact her account should be permanently banned as it is not even considering recent events
2007scape,removed,fuck you ronan do something useful
2007scape,removed,what a fucking idiot
2007scape,removed,mod mat cuck
2007scape,removed,you might find it interesting when the logs show up and they say that you said get cancer bald btch even if you have no memory of saying that
2007scape,removed,because mod mat is a white knight faggot who probably tries to slide in the pms
2007scape,removed,no shit that the community is ass afbrap are also shit and is a downie hypocrite
2007scape,removed,raid the official forums with ban emily threads

2007scape,removed,scroll though her daily viewer any time there is a spike when she starts streaming its a viewbot you just need to compare her daily viewer growth to any other channel to see that she has a viewbot on
2007scape,removed,summoned by here is a word cloud of every comment in this thread as of this time httpsgithubcomwinneonmakeswordclouds httpsredditcomuserwinneonsword
2007scape,removed,nigger cunt pussy jew kike gook ass fuck shit can we now stop pretending that these words actually offend anybody if it does than they need to grow up
2007scape,removed,if you cant see the levels of magnitude in difference between waitress flirting and taking cancer you need to seriously reevaluate either that or you are one of her lackeys that is just as far gone as the idiots that help cry wolf every time something bad happens
2007scape,removed,they were not banned for trying to act like the kkk its a fucking poor excuse mate they were obviously banned for standing near emily and we all know how thirsty that goblin lookin ass nigga mat k and his fuckboy ronan are for some sweet chemo filled pussy
2007scape,removed,what a waste of human life what the fuck
2007scape,removed,enjoy your fucking downvote faggot

2007scape,removed,poor nothing the man is an idiot for his creepy obsession with female streamers
2007scape,removed,i dont wish cancer on anybody but if emily actually got cancer thats probably the first time ive felt it being justified awful but justified
2007scape,removed,i bet you say cxxxx what arm thing xd irl aswell fucking downy

2007scape,removed,multiple people got permad fucking idiot
2007scape,removed,no facts to bee seen here wow fuck you guys and your incredibly unprofessional behavior
2007scape,removed,look i really dont like her either and i share the opinion that shes a money hungry cunt manipulating desperate people following somebody to world after world and crashing only them at bosses is harassment not part of the game that should be a bannable offense you cant have it both ways wanting everybody to be treated equally when it comes to bansmutes includes actually punishing players who harass somebody you hate
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,remove desert robes too racist seriously fuck you ronan
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,i was unaware crashing players was against the rules now how do we hire jmods to follow us around and ban anybody who crashes us fuck off you white knight fedora wearing little bitch
2007scape,removed,hello my friend decided to start playing osrs but hes scared that his account will be banned from the game for standing next to twitch streamers could you please post a list of people that he should avoid
2007scape,removed,dont make contact with female streamers ingame they have special privileges and can get you banned
2007scape,removed,dont use the emotes in a bad way dont pk the streamers dont crash a streamer and stay away from all players and mods turn off all chat and never say a word you should be alright and enjoy it
2007scape,removed,the first link is the early iteration of the log the second is the later one which i think has more screenshots i will disclaim to say that some kicks probably arent that offensive but it should act as an indication of the volume of stuff dealt with there may well be a current kicklog in use but i doubt current mods will disclose details
2007scape,removed,umodronan is literally shaking after reading letters mashed together when ever he sees a word that rhymes with triggered he gets triggered guys come on not everyone here has been on the internet before not everyone here lives in the real world where we hear the word nigger on the news every night this is really hard for some people let runescape be a safe space
2007scape,removed,who cares what emily thinks she gets special crap so she gets special treatment to whitewash the crap from the eyes of the public who cares what category the ban was under it was clearly stated for harassing other streamers in the evidence category the category is absolutely irrelevant an utter smoke screen
2007scape,removed,well alone we are weak as a stick but together our voice is as strong as a mighty faggot
2007scape,removed,you are a faggot for even hanging around streamers have you seriously got nothing better to do than be around a streamer on a fantasy game get a life ffs

2007scape,removed,if you cant find a pserver to try killing jad on what i did to help prepare me was put up a video in the background of someone else killing jad and only listening to the audio while pray flicking ingame it also helps studying all the potential jad spawns and i believe that one of the mages that spawn on wave will also indicate where jad will spawn additionally the way i killed jad was to lure him in such a way that the healers get stuck behind him i believe you achieve this by luring him to the northern rock while you stand on the east side of that rock aka dragon rock apparently
2007scape,removed,pretty sure there is a website if you google jad simulation or something similar for practicing pray flicking no suggestions for moving and healers but its easy once switching is down always pray mage switch if you hear mage spell range spell is silent
2007scape,removed,just get slayer you whiny cunts

2007scape,removed,jagex is fucking retarded if they think its the same as fucking botting botting is where a computer controls hundreds of accounts at one time for hours on end and repeats it farming gold into the game ahk just allows players to skill more efficiently on a single account jagex youre fucking retarded for banning this

2007scape,removed,reddit isnt the community and just because reddit is unhappy doesnt mean they have to do anything about it get over yourself the biggest thread with the most gold ever and youre advocating its dismissal you really think the masses were happy with that hideous square are you happy it was clearly rushed out simply untrue their shady silence and pathetic handling of that situation that week makes me doubt that qas fault do you expect mat to individually test everything they fucked up blame them its his job to manage the team and their projects you cretin there was a massive thread telling them not to release it its his job as project manager to ensure shit like this doesnt happen yethe threw it out anyway
2007scape,removed,can you stop sucking jagex dick every time they update jesus christ
2007scape,removed,like i said earlier dmm dies out as it progresses so you really think limiting the combat bracket to levels below and above you would really keep the game mode alive it might spark some players into playing at first like all new updates but itll die out faster than anything and no theres nothing wrong with pures theres a reason why they dominate in pvp but to start one from scratch and lose stats every single time you die is ludacris not to mention youd just get outplayed by range tanks in early levels like the current dmm oh what a surprise you obviously dont have any experience in any kind of pvp hence why you would suggest something so ludacris not to mention if you did actually play dmm why would you want to limit the combat bracket at all in the first place oh right because you do actually probably just pvm and skill and have no experience in pvp so in a game mode that dies out when you can attack anybody almost anywhere you now have to only attack people levels below and higher than you lmfao and im sure you play dmm because you wrote a tiny paragraph that you thought would solve dmm have you ever read any other serious posts that addresses the issues of dmm do you know how long those posts are they actually address the issues that arise in dmm and the possible flaws your post is legit autism you must be like to think that making dmm turn into pvp worlds would aid an already doomed game mode
2007scape,removed,good point he should use chain for this but he should still do dragon slayer
2007scape,removed,gratz kill yourself

2007scape,removed,i would say money and power is the root of all evil and religion is used to convince people to fight for their leader i actually think there are more reasons than religion behind isis terrorists are told the western world are the real terrorists and if your village got bombed by the us some people will join isis

2007scape,removed,i dont know how this isent already a thing copypastas are pretty much the bane of shitposters it speeds up memespamming autists alot and it should be alot easier to detect a poster thats actually shitposting compared to a average level shitposter lets do it
2007scape,removed,wtf thats weird as hell
2007scape,removed,everyone votes like a selfish cunt why are you people even discussing the obvious
2007scape,removed,yes they were the later ones
2007scape,removed,totally get that how many people actually will quit if a graphical update gets implemented though your iq would have to be around if someone offered you two tvs a one and a one and you select the second option osbuddy update looks pretty damn nice imo without changing the game the point of a graphical update would be to make the game look more crisp such as the call of duty remastered i saw my friend playing it and was pretty impressed my whole point is is dying and will frankly continue to do so the trend i have saw the past months is osrs player count increasing while is decreasing as a company jagex needs to sustain and in order to do so osrs looks like the answer a graphical update would most certainly attract new players and nobody would quit the game in all honesty so long as they dont go full retard mode with it
2007scape,removed,well deserved upvote jagex needs to focus all dev time on clerical errors fuck real updates
2007scape,removed,well i love how its so rare i rape pvp in deep wildy smited few agss with rig alrdy love it op

2007scape,removed,bogla gold

2007scape,removed,leaking your info is usually not the cause now i know youre actually an idiot if you keep up with people getting hacked in this game at all you would know thats the main cause they dont leak their info on purpose its found from datadumps getting doxd if you had the intelligence to understand im sure you would but its hard to explain this to people who cant comprehend simple things so ill dumb it down for you to rat someone takes a large amount of time effort you need to trick or convince someone to download a rat which is very hard to do youre not going to see someone with a bank say hey download this for me and they will do it it just doesnt happen so please explain how all these streamers youtubers are getting hacked i would love to hear your side also counterproductive for i linked the main rs site that gives proven tips that will improve your account security all my tips make it literally impossible for someone to doxddos you which is a big issue for many players in this game if they cant get your ip in the first place youre unable to get recovered to begin with so what youre saying is false do some research before leaving retarded comments k thanks

2007scape,removed,in the postcomment made by the jmod about this they said they banned him because of their own evidence gathering not by parties
2007scape,removed,its because the jmods are banning people under pressure from reddit they would never take the initiative to go out and ban him based on reports purely banned because of the rs social justice warriors thats the point idgaf if that kid loses his bank or not he would never be banned without making a video but i guess half the retards on here cant think for themselves and have to have someone make them feel better because of their broke ass

2007scape,removed,through being heavily involved in runescapes black market scene over the past few years i have made a new discovery regarding a somewhat wellknown individual in the community sythe is a massive if not the largest rwtblackmarket runescape community on september the sythe user divicasales the owner of a major goldselling website posted a personal photo of herself and her boyfriend now ex on a thread entitled faces of the donor lounge a specific thread on sythe for users to share photos on themselves if you are a donor on sythe and would like to view the post i have linked it in this pastebin as reddit blocks most offsite urls i was recently browsing awwsmiles twitter and as i was browsing nothing really stood out the next day as i accidentally came back to it again the profile picture seemed familiar to me for a certain reason i scoured all of my gyazo history and found that awwsmile looks exactly like the girl in the picture that divicasales posted httpstwittercomawwsmile next i decided to do some more digging as i was fairly certain that there was no way this could be possible i took a look at her twitch channel and this was where i became certain that there was no way they were different people she claims that her nationality is australian and that she recently moved from aus to the uk her old boyfriend david aka divica is from aus this recent change perfectly matches what has recently happened in jesss life at this time i was still very slightly unsure if it was the same person but this next part was the nail in the coffin the sythe user divicasales is referred to by herself and many other individuals and members of sythe as jess or jessica which is completely fitting as awwsmile does claim her name is that there are many more examples but these are just a few this pastebin includes links to the posts if you dont want to view the links here are the images after confirming my suspicions i was honestly shocked how someone who was so involved in the runescape community could also be so heavily involved in realworldtrading and not have been caught for this amount of time it honestly baffles me as to how this is even possible if jess is so involved in the real world trading and runescape livestreaming scene whats to say she isnt secretly helping twitch streamers such as afro george ianspam emilyispro skillspecs etc realworldtrade without being caught surely it isnt too unreasonable to consider it a possibility im very curious as to how many of you have bought or sold her gold in the past the numbers are probably shocking credit goes to this guy
2007scape,removed,spending thousands upon thousands of hours in a year old video game doing the same thing over and over some sort of combination of mental illnessdisorder physical illnessdisorder social functioning disorder exists in those people the majority of the time its as simple as that youre most likely just in some form of denial

2007scape,removed,i didnt have a candidate the system is still broken because it disregards the majority vote it may not be broken but it is absolutely flawed an election is supposed to be about determining what the people want who they trust not about determining who the people that matter trust not to mention the fact that theyre not even required to choose the candidate that the majority voted for you cant reasonably state that not having to count every vote is a good thing because any system that disregards your vote on the basis that the guy whose vote dose matter disagrees with it is not only flawed but totally immoral and while electors may usually go with the popular vote their role is still completely unacceptable nbsp just because counting every vote has downsides does not in any way justify shelving it when doing the right thing is hard you dont just give up on it and do the wrong thing instead you figure out how to deal with it and make it easier if possible nbsp it shouldnt matter that its hard elections are hard something being hard is not an excuse not to do that thing especially when that thing is the most important facet of democracy which should be important given that we like to call it a democratic election nbsp tldr its not really democratic if you disregard genuine votes
2007scape,removed,seems like op is just one of the losers who supported clinton

2007scape,removed,this went from a funny meme to really creepy
2007scape,removed,what you retards dont get is these stream whores blatently break twitch rules and get away with it because of either ties with admins or twitch white knights the same twitch whores you are white knighting for are the ones showing nudity on stream and not even getting a day ban meanwhile other streamers nonbooby streamers get permd after offenses

2007scape,removed,the fuck why are you linking that sub lmao its true shit is mad creepy and he should have some humility dude has a wife a child he should not be chit chatting with female streamers whose webcam takes up of the screen especially not after recent events he is the head of the osrs team i do not think he should be mingling with titty streamers he should be mingling with other streamers ie streamers without ulterior motives

2007scape,removed,yep theyre suddenly going to change their policy on account sharing to ban a player that they could easily justify banning for harassment that makes a lot of sense youre truly an intellectual mastermind at this point youre disregarding of my comment to nitpick on your poor understanding of the english language and your terrible common sense they wouldnt be changing any policy theyve never said you will never get banned for account sharing months before he said no one has been banned for account sharing on osrs and what is your point youre aware that using the terms unlikely and probably dont automatically mean that its possible to be banned for account sharing right im aware hence why mat k said nobody on osrs has been banned and hence why this dude received a locked account and a warning instead you are aware that doesnt mean nobody will ever be banned for it correct the average account sharer is never going to get banned the reason they use those uncertain terms is to cover their backs in case they need to call on that rule to ban somebody in a very special circumstance which is usually more than just account sharing except like you just said they wouldnt be banned for account sharing then itd be harassment again youre putting words into mat k and infinitys mouth dont just say it do it it would be pretty funny knowing that youre going to be wasting a couple of hours of your life searching google for quotes from random companies to try and win an argument youve already lost about comments ago ok then microsoft in they issued out a pr statement and advertised it in videos that that xbox was the only system with every top best selling games released in tell me right now when you read that what do you make of that and when you tell me your answer im going to tell you why youre wrong and why you should always read exactly what these companies say in public

2007scape,removed,i had to make a reddit acount just to reply to this you really think from reading someones post on reddit you can determine if theyve consumed a substance do you think only gangsters and people in movies take drugs youd be fucking surprised and youll learn when you grow up a bit that people from all walks of life consume drugs and most are not addicts there are multiple studies on this jesus christ you are naive just because someone plays osrs doesnt mean they havent done drugs i have no clue where that notion even makes any logical sense in your brain

2007scape,removed,the problem with the dragon shortsword being a special attack weapon is that its very hard to compete with the dragon dagger dragon warhammer granite maul and arguably the dragon mace all max hits and accuracy are calculated with the max straccuracy bonus of a defense zerk dragon dagger max hit stab bonus special bar dragon warhammer max hit crush bonus special bar lowers targets current defense by making it the best special attack weapon for pvm granite maul max hit crush bonus special bar can be used for instantaneous combos with a variety of weapons dragon mace max hit crush bonus special bar now compare all of those with your proposed dragon shortsword max hit stab bonus special bar obviously it falls incredibly short however this does not mean it needs to have a stronger special attack it could be a mainhand weapon instead eg dragon scimitar the problem there is do people want a stronger andor more accurate mainhand weapon for attack my feeling is that people initially wouldnt want the dragon scimitar being out competed at the very least in its str bonus so why not make the dragon shortswords stats nearly identical to the scimitar same str bonus but perhaps something like stab bonus compared to the scimitars slash bonus to make up for the fact that most monsters and armor are more weak to slash than stab the best way to make it distinctive from the scimitar other than in appearance is its special attack now mainhand weapons special attacks are traditionally niche and i would strongly suggest keeping it that way my suggestion ignores targets protect from melee prayer the possibility to hit a remains special bar i think this would be a nice special attack that fits the theme for mainhand weapons while not being overpowered

2007scape,removed,i read through your comment and am interested into how clinical she was initially in her handjobs if i for whatever reason had to masturbate a male friend or family member of mine i would try to make my technique as uniform and devoid of personality as possible it sounds like your mother initially framed her offer as just fulfilling a basic physical need and things escalated gradually over time did she vary speed and pressure focus on different parts of the penis switch to just stroking your head or testicles etc are you circumcised was it purely a pumping closed hand thing or would she ever just stroke one finger up and down the shaft and whatnot i guess i mostly want to know how much personality and sensuality she initially put into your handjobs versus a purely clinical robotic approach and how much of her technique involved communication between the both of you beyond the pure physical aspects beyond the pure physical sensation of being masturbated was there anything she did initially that was a particular turnon for you i guess since you were too incapacitated to masturbate yourself this wouldnt have initially been the case but did she ever encourage you to grope her was she ever topless or nude during the handjob stage did any handjobs ever take place in the shower or bathtub would she increase the speed and instensity to get you to cum how hard would you say you came compared to when you normally masturbated any vocal encouragement to cum after saying just relax and let go the first time after cumming would she continue to masturbate you for a few seconds did she ever comment on your ejaculations in a way meant to turn you on did her handjobs start off clinically and gradually get more sensual after a period of weeks before progressing to oral you said there was no dirty talk but she was clinical in her descriptions of what she was doing in a way that got you off could you give any examples how turned on were you by the communication did either of you ever laugh just cause of the absurdity of the situation did you look at each other at all during this if you did did she try to turn you on with her facial expressions a warm maternal smile meant to get you to relax and release or a dirtier sultry eyebrow raised expressions i can only imagine how your face looked initially the first few times do you think she was turned on by this if you did look at each other would she maintain eye contact as you ejaculated and would she smile when you finally came this is kind of dumb but my own personal fantasy surrounding your situation is me wearing pajama pants or sweats getting a large and obvious erection and then walking to your mom reading on the couch and just kind of motioning at the situation and she puts her book down smiles and says ok did anything remotely similar to this ever happen i think it is clear by how this progressed that your mother must have had some level of attraction to you could you initially tell this was the case

2007scape,removed,yes
2007scape,removed,there was a legitimate reason for it jagex continued to power creep the game until they were unable to add any more content reasonably that is why the jmods in osrs keep trying to slow down the addition of stronger armorweapons that is also why everything they make has multiple attack styles or can hit through prayer or both everything in could be defeated with prayer and a whip eoc made it so prayer only blocks half damage and the combat triangle was required to kill bosses they also rescaled all the armor and weapons so you would always have to use the highest tier available to you for the maximum dps however the huge mistake wasnt any of that but it was the implementation of the action bar

2007scape,removed,hi one of the new old school pmods here ill try to explain what happened and some other things pmod management and leadership is shared between community management ronan merchant and customer support in this case mod stevew mod ash was simply giving his opinion as a content developer he technically didnt have jurisdiction or knowhow to give an official answer as the player who tweeted him was expecting as to merchants tweet he was mistaken about ironmen being allowed pmod we player mods already knew this and merchants tweet was brought up in our forums with follow up confirming that it was a misspoke on merchants part merchant is still new to the role so he wasnt aware of the precedent set around irons not being allowed pmod on their iron account anyway merchant didnt follow up on it after being corrected on the issue which left the idea around unfortunately that ironmen were or were ever eligible for pmod selection the person who was running the checks on pmod candidates note doesnt play old school really and therefore missed the name giveaway didnt check for iron status which led to iron cub getting his invite reasons why irons cant be pmods mods need to be identifiable if you have an ironman chatsymbol no one can identify you as a pmod say what you will about incognito mods etc but we need to be identifiable in our role especially due to pmod phishing attempts that go conusing ironman icons any ironman could claim to be a pmod and you wouldnt know phishers actively use ironman chat symbols to phish other players as is the whole issue could be solved through creating a pmod specific ironman icon but that would take development time and resources that the pmod team has no control over

2007scape,removed,are you retarded the initial ban was most likely because they assumed it was hacked then botted on they can ban for whatever they want maybe he decided that was more appropriate at the time to ban for then youre coming in and saying you willingly gave access to the account to your friend who proceeded to bot on it your friend also could have been hacking accounts you admitted that your friend must be the one botting the accounts however the ban is applied to the account not to your so any actions done on the account should condone the appropriate punishment its not getting unbanned shouldnt have let him on an account you cared about

2007scape,removed,people like you give me cancer its a good change for people that dont want to wait a month get over it idiot
2007scape,removed,what kinda weeabo fag eats shark pies and manta ray pizza
2007scape,removed,ok essentially for what you have said with only needing to run runescape instances take these an or higher is fine stick with intel cpu and unless you want to explain why just take my word for it stick with or higher ram granted is most likely enough times but with you will prob never hit the peak the hdd is good but if theres an ssd option take that this is storage hdd is a mechanical storage while ssd is not mechanical so ssd is a lot faster but it cost more for the same amount of storage so unless you download a ton ill take a ssd over a hdd focus on the ram and pricing really everything else will fall into place since you are not customizing it
2007scape,removed,isnt that what hes trying to push for though like hell send woox his own money but hell try to get jagex to put a prize for him in the budget if that were me i would have absolutely accepted depending on how much he was talking about if it was something large like of his salary like you say i would politely decline something lower that he wont have to budget around sure gimme dat shit though if jagex did come through id send ash his money back and then some just for being so generous he didnt have to do this but he realizes somebody feels like they were wronged and wants to make up for that i totally get that
2007scape,removed,i agree you dont make an offer unless youre serious especially when it comes to money i didnt lose respect for anyone as i never had any for them in the first place but i absolutely would not accept from somebody whos salary is maybe something smaller like sure id take it if it turned out jagex was able to add it to the budget i would give ash whatever he gave me back with a little extra just because im not in the greatest of situations irl but i have morals and have a lot of respect for people who work hard for their money even more respect for someone willing to admit a mistake might have been made and do whatever it takes to fix that mistake even if it means doing so in his own time with his own money
2007scape,removed,meh whatever you call it i respect ash for admitting there may have been a mistake made and offering his own money in order to right that wrong
2007scape,removed,i really have no idea how much they make over at jagex and i dont know personally who ash is it was just a guess to make my point but apparently youd rather get caught up in semantics ah love this community
2007scape,removed,really had no idea who he was or what he did for jagex honestly just threw out a number so i could get my point across
2007scape,removed,i dont participate in the community events or streams really have been pretty disconnected from jagex staff since first came out before that i would occasionally chat with paul mod mark good people especially paul he was extremely kind and would answer almost any question i had didnt know ash has been with them for so long thanks for the info kind stranger
2007scape,removed,before your post gets deleted just wanted to say fuck off
2007scape,removed,completely agree the top part just looks weird other than that its perfect
2007scape,removed,lets just end this right here man unless you can bring up something new i guess we can agree to disagree xd im not actually sure if you have been contradicting yourself as much as i think you have because in any of the cases you havent really explained what you specifically meant or why it wasnt a contradiction when you said some of these things so i just assumed you were contradicting yourself assuming things isnt a retarded action by default it depends on what you assume really assumptions are videly used in mathematical and philosophical logic and youd be amazed if you knew how accurate some assumptions that even seem to come out of nowhere actually can be but yes i agree some assuptions are retarded like for instance assuming something is wrong because its poorly argued another logical fallacy dont feel too bad about the contradictions anyway i used to do it a bit back in the day when i was more retarded and every single time i would notice it or someone else would point it out i would feel like a stupid fuck for probably hours i would always try to learn from the situation i would think about what i actually meant to say etc it definitely comes down to nurture and not nature so thats good with a poor upbringing no real education and no training anyone can really contradict themselves not sure if any of this is the case for you but i wouldnt be surprised
2007scape,removed,my upset my upset what sounds like youre the one talking out of their ass if youre going to try and insult someone at least try to use correct grammar english has been in its current form for hundreds of years and you still dont know the difference between your which denotes possession and youre which is short for you are id kill myself if i was that fucking inept i bet you use their there and theyre incorrectly too and you probably say should of instead of shouldve meaning should have fuck off with your nonsense at least pass middle school english class before you try to act high and mighty
2007scape,removed,not exactly talking about rocket science or anything im sorry you dropped out of highschool but that isnt my fault nor is it my problem enjoy life as a dropout edgelord ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°

2007scape,removed,ok the most valuable skill you can learn for kq is staggering whenever you need to eat you stand underneath her thats pretty much it she does such a huge amount of damage because both her mage and range attacks have accuracy the way you cut this down is by not letting her initiate an attack which means standing underneath her this doesnt work when there are more than person in the room experiment with your right click options and see which one is more effective for you default was better for me but some people prefer to have npc attack options on always right click because it lets them move under her easier without making mistakes

2007scape,removed,the difference between lol and osrs is that you get a multiple warnings no matter how big a piece of shit you are chat restriction for games then then etc you dont get banned unless if you stream while you do it or piss off the wrong person even then the ban sometimes only lasts for a bit a couple of weeks at most this nigga got banned for whatever the fuckidgaf who you are or what you said with no warning like if youre going to ban someone build up to that shit especially if its communication sure if someone is doing something that is literally violating the rules of the game and twisting code or whatever making it easier to play for their advantage in an unethical way of course ban them with no regrets but if its player harassmentjust in this case really a ban if youre going to be quite precise on who gets banned for harassing a viplol vip my ass gtfo only vip are the people who moderate this game then how about you stop cherry picking people and ban others who actually deserved to be banned just because some bitchanyone in particular couldnt take a few jabs at the chest doesnt mean you shoot them dead because they were joking but instead you break their wrists and make it so that they have time to recover to make sure if they do something similar in nature that they think twice before acting rant

2007scape,removed,yeah and its not just doing it to random people either he picks a target like op and stays on them forever its clear harassment and jmods arent doing anything about it even after the stream today where they promised they would deal with harassment better also thanks for the downvotes random reddit cunt
2007scape,removed,driving like an idiot is illegal making it through a yellow isnt thats the difference doing tongue in cheek emotes at someone who did something really stupid isnt anything worth looking into an account for

2007scape,removed,lesson learned i guess not in a bad way i mean it could have been way worse there could have been a secret undercover jmod lurking and saw you did that and ip banned you then called the cops because it was a front for a black market website meanwhile they think youre some war criminal so they end up sending a swat team and before you know it youre in maximum security prison in guam
2007scape,removed,you have a splasher and a cooker i made a reddit account just to tell you to piss off you basically did the hello world of runescape scripts lmao attention whore
2007scape,removed,did he ask about his accounts stats no he didnt you fucking troglodyte op is obviously capable of doing zulrah maybe shit players like you need to grind out to kill a joke of a boss
2007scape,removed,you are clearly retarded its like a small business owner paying a protection fee to a local gang you dont have pay but there are consequences if you that you shouldnt have to deal with in this case op is the business owner and hes now going to the police
2007scape,removed,im pretty sure osrs has more active members than so i would assume that means were getting a decent amount of new players and not just ones that are returning could be wrong though i guess
2007scape,removed,if you dont mind me asking i notice you have some sort of autism or mental handicap

2007scape,removed,rwted or got hacked by friends surrounded on all sides by the most vile racism on the internet beyond levels of autism
2007scape,removed,hop worlds retard
2007scape,removed,basically there have been multiple situations where people acting fully within the rules of the game have been banned for training next to her or killing her in the wildy or simply following her around and doing emotes this mostly seems to be done by one mod mat k the mods claim that all the people are being banned because of different offenses on their account from years ago but even if thats true i think its wrong that slightly inconveniencing a streamer can result in a complete investigation of your account
2007scape,removed,this is the type of thing you shouldnt avoid you shouldnt make bets and run away you owe me ill only accept bitcoin since you seem like the type of guy to refund via paypal
2007scape,removed,u retarded or what
2007scape,removed,well rip those idiots lmao

2007scape,removed,emily said she loves my vids in my newest vid go watch it to find out lol jk that was more clickbait than roman atwoodleafyother clickbait youubers
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,we need to not make a big fuss about it on reddit because it brings her attention and that isnt what we want is it she will get whats coming to her in the long run and unless its game breaking which it isnt in this case because theres chance she wins the tourny we really need to let it go and stop with this zero tolerance bullshit i wouldnt be surprised if someone made a post complaining about something as small as her saying fuck you in game to someone some of us on this subreddit just need to chill the fuck out and stop watching her streams and paying attention to her since we all fucking hate the cunt so much
2007scape,removed,because shes sucked too much jmod cock to ever get banned for anything she could literally anally fist chris archie dry and get away with it at this point
2007scape,removed,bit out of the loop isnt there a video of her saying she has leukaemia or was that a fake or something
2007scape,removed,how autistic can someone be hey did u get my msg cx xdddddd
2007scape,removed,since this is the one thread that hasnt been deleted so far heres a summary emily is streaming the dmm invitational on some account named adrenti that shes never played before after she got killed on stream she logged out and started playing csgo while she was playing csgo adrenti logged back into rs trained some and then got killed again evidence httpimgurcomauwciy now the only people who can prove that adrenti was training while emily was playing csgo are jmods someone actually got ahold of mod mat k via twitch whisper and he didnt seem very interested in investigating the situation this thread is just asking the question why do they not care
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,i dont use the word literally much but she literally sounds like a year old boy

2007scape,removed,people have tried to be nice and it has gotten us nowhere at all the only way anything will get done about this lying bitch is by a massive uproar
2007scape,removed,ice poseidon deserves to have his flightshotel paid the rest of you are boring aspie retards who should get real jobs only ice has the potential to make an actual career out of streaming the rest of you have personality the only thing in your favour is youre too autistic to go outside and play rs all day

2007scape,removed,rot has not been banned and will not be banned because there is nothing directly in the tos that prevents what theyre doing so directly banning them would be a horrible pr decision thats wrong first of all there was a rot member yesterday who said they were banned so you are literally talking out of your ass second of all it absolutely is against the rules and jagex have explicitly said so when the streamer favortism only exists within the minds of children who arent presented with the instant gratification they constantly whine for yet at the same time those same people are the majority of the democracy shit like this is what happens what the fuck instant gratification are you talking about this isnt call of duty you cant just throw in fancy buzzwords and expect it to make sense thats not how this works youre literally talking about some pseudointellectual shit that nobody cares about and isnt even true to begin with i am telling you facts and you are pulling shit out of your ass then trying to sound smart by using words you dont even understand
2007scape,removed,dead man mode and a streamer who faked cancer and constantly breaks the rules and avoids being banned by dickriding the mods

2007scape,removed,since when is account sharing allowed anywhere in game i am aware of the multilogging rule being changed but never account sharing could you please link me to a jagex moderator confirming this

2007scape,removed,the rule is a myth and you can still get banned correct but no one has been banned for solely using so far modmatk our approach to ahk has not changed so if you have been using it for a long time and have not been banned you are probably safe to assume what you are doing is okay labelling ahkmousekeys as cheats in
2007scape,removed,i guess those eyes made it hard to see
2007scape,removed,when ice is on if he finishes his stream people raid emilys stream if shes on they spam it and often get banned

2007scape,removed,fuck off nigger
2007scape,removed,in grade i watched inception without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i understood more of the concept than the average person using it to make memes about things being repeated in my subreddit a movie trivia quiz has shown me to be in the percentile for cinematography knowledge this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an astronomer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand intersteller better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding exposition hes not particularly successful as an astronomer but ive met lots of other astronomers who arent as good as me at understanding the movie so im guessing thats not just a result of him being a pleb im also pretty good at science i dont have a degree and other than intersteller i dont have a better understanding of any scifi movie than any actual scientist but i have lots of ingenuity for disecting movie science for example i independently fact checked gravity before watching neil degrasse tysons videos and i was only seven or eight years old when i started watching star wars my first idea being to use a powerful infrared lightsaber to keep george lucas away from the franchise admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every plot of a marvel movie ive come across every aspect of story which ive seen in captain america or iron man or thor or anywhere else the plots havent been new to me marvel studios has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered watching not a movie but daredevil to see how predictible it is to me tarantino i actually understand better than people with movie review websites unlike sci fi theres no aspect of tarantino which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even rfantheories theories im a good enough writer that im writing a screenplay and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have directed by tarantino and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture michael bay at the end of tranformers i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of movie preference whatsoever short of physically going to see an adam sandler movie tyler perry films or other movies which are pretentious oscar bait but i dont care what a persons preferences consist of as long as they recognize the difference between underated gems and crap and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of comicbook universe they like or cosplay they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness spike lee is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive watched a hobbit movie without fighting back or seeking retribution because the projectionist stopped playing it after that the only time ill fight back is if the person showing me the film shows no signs of stopping if i dont attack my childhood will be ruined in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to watch overated movies has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to give a one star review i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after nolans library even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting nolans legacy if someone reccomends a cgi filled movie like avatar to me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women the same way mad max treated furiousa in mad max fury road and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women in mad max fury road and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome like melissa mccarthy that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit movie community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are mindfucked or upset about leo being snubbed and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments and uh im a pretty good moderator all that and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think now that you at least slightly know me

2007scape,removed,i dont understand why shes mad becuz she is in fact a nigger sigh we have video evidence of this
2007scape,removed,boooooooooooooooooooring af
2007scape,removed,heres one way to look at it pros low magic level requirement high max hit low rune cost cons requires completion of underground pass have to recharge it near the end of the tunnel to be able to use it frequently one time payment of coins to make it optimal for reliability on the other hand with trident pros faster attack speed more dps not having to reselect autocast when unequipped no inventory slots for runes cons high magic requirement less max hit until near max magic level higher upkeep cost to continue using each one has its own benefits for what you pour into it but the trident is meant for a much higher leveled person than ibans blast which is ideally used at a lower level you trade off convenience for a very hard hitting spell at a low level
2007scape,removed,exactly i think osrs designs are better because to me runescape that had medieval theme to it that the armors captured perfectly it has nothing to do with nostalgia
2007scape,removed,tfw youre going down is playing on his spotify too
2007scape,removed,im calling you a moron because your argument that the new con update would devalue and make your desert amulet redundant is stupid when there is already a way people use to restore spechealth without desert ammy by your logic you shouldve complained when they released the desert dairys that the nardah altar is pointless because dueling rings existmoron

2007scape,removed,r u a nigger
2007scape,removed,why do i get the feeling that before you made this post you were smoking crack out of a fucking bamboo stick you are the exact definition of a braindead autist that should be gunned down in the streets like the degenerate you are
2007scape,removed,those people most likely arent mentally stable either this is the result of bad parenting of an autistic child lynx could have put thousands of hours into something else and it actually have been useful instead you have a kid who is scared to leave his room is scared to eat anything but lasagnaand is scared to deviate from his own set schedule when you have an autistic child you expose them to circumstances that arent ideal to them to show them that everythings ok when you are minutes late for something to get them comfortable around strangers and settings that are unfamiliar with them the truth is people who have aspergers autism or wherever they are on the spectrum can perfectly integrate with the rest of the world and be normal human beings you could marry someone whos deemed autistic and not even know it because people can learn whats normal people can learn that things are ok and they can learn to use their autism as a gift instead of a crux to your everyday life but sure who am i to say whats right and wrong blah blah but i can assure you lynx titan probably wishes he wasnt wasting away his life on a video game because hes afraid of whats outside the comfort of his own bedroom
2007scape,removed,just buy gold

2007scape,removed,yes its hard for him to find a world and he wants to cannon for more xphr retard
2007scape,removed,im not a lawyer but suing takes a long time and the defence is normally considered free to continue doing what theyre doing until the case is closed pretty sure if the sites are hosted by servers abroad then they will have to take them down according to the law in those countries and some countries have laws that protect the sites sometimes its worth going after the internet service providers forcing them to block the websites but that still costs a lot of money and involves many empty threats many of the sites are owned by people who arent rich and cant pay for damages after losing a case jagex would indefinitely lose a lot of money on each case sellers normally operate on multiple websites if they finally manage to successfully sue and take the website down nothing stops the owner by instantly making another one under a new url
2007scape,removed,ill get hate for this and its most certainly going to get downvoted the clip ends with him saying some people are just born retarded hes absolute right some people are he now chooses to call this person a retard to insult him thereby saying that people who are actually born with mental disabilities are low enough to be considered an insult alfie is a scummy person frankly so is anyone who will call someone else autistic retarded or anything of that manner in a derogative way
2007scape,removed,just dont be retarded
2007scape,removed,jesus christ youre actually retarded arent you i complain on reddit because people crash others just to be a dick the room was already filled up and then someone places down a cannon so were forced to hop or move to another area anyone would be annoyed by that

2007scape,removed,i mean maybe if you didnt base a business model out of a social media outlet and instead made a platform on your own website maybe this type of shit wont happen maybe if jagex wasnt retarded you wouldnt see retards getting the best of them

2007scape,removed,are you a white knight i dont care about her brother or that he got hacked for having terrible account security the point is that shes attention whoring by using her siblings misfortunes and posting shit that should be kept in private without consent as for me i attend university you seem like some triggered high school dropout who wants to be a baker for a living and got triggered by me making fun of it the least important part of that post yes baking cakes for years is much worse than spending a portion of your time playing a game for especially true if this guy indeed has some mental health problem and even if he didnt have a medical condition using your siblings misfortunes making them public for everyone to see just so you can get viewsfollowers makes you a fucking cunt saying these ridiculous things go bake another cake youre defending this attention whoring cunt because you identify with her cake baking lmfao
2007scape,removed,this pastebin was posted by the user who said he found it on the dark web where hijackers abused it to hijack ppl

2007scape,removed,i think it depends on how old the account is if its a fresh off tutorial island bot youre getting permed i botted accs at once when i started classes again to make up for not having a full time job of them were level with like hunter ea the account id had for some time only got weeks though i think if you have a legitimate account that you started botting on youll get weeks and keep all items if youre a gold farming account then youll get permed otherwise all the items would be sold after the weeks

2007scape,removed,ok this is absolute fucking bullshit i went to see cars in the theater yesterday and when lightning mcqueen got hot with sally in radiator springs my boner engaged when lightning mcqueen said kachow i couldnt help it i closed my eyes and i tore my dick to shreds using whip like motions and pulled with great force that was one of the best nuts i ever had just thinking about it now gets me riled up thing is i nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me and his mom got all pissed at me screaming at me for jacking off on her son i told that bitch to shut the fuck up and that jacking off is a natural artistic and beautiful process you should be happy that my semen is all over your son maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off however the movie theater managers didnt agree with me they kicked me out of the movie theater and i didnt even finish watching the cars movie not only that but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats thats torture do you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out you clean semen after its fresh out of your cock not an hour after you fucking nutted this is a fucking outrage do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a hot sex scene in a movie either dont ban sex scenes in movies or let me jack off in your theater assholes

2007scape,removed,when i was my mom had this one cleaning lady marie who would cleaned once a month she was in her early by the looks of it and she didnt speak much english whenever i walked by it was generally just a smile and a quick hi as time went on my mother trusted her more and more and she would allow marie to come in and clean the house even when mother wasnt present one day i had returned home from school and i needed to study for a spanish exam so i sat down on the couch and started reading aloud my flashcards marie started cleaning around my area and chuckled under her breath at my myriad mispronunciations she rested her lemon pledge on the floor and picked up the next flashcard palahbra she read from the card enunciating so i would get the correct pronunciation marie was a very good teacher and we served a mutual benefit for each other she could help me with spanish and i taught her conversational english phrases in our all time together i couldnt help but notice how beautiful she was brown hair a thin face with almond shaped eyes amazing curves from her chest to her legs on her frame i loved the way she bit her lip when she thought the way she would turn her head down when she laughed was this lust or more one day i was stepping out of the shower and realized i had forgotten my towel my room is adjacent to the bathroom so i saw no harm in just walking naked there little did i know that marie was on the other side cleaning she turned around and gasped and quickly covered her eyes im so sorry she yelled however i was not i walked closer to her and said dont be i put my hands on her hips and slowly pulled her in towards me she turned to me and gazed at my young supple year old body glistening from the recent shower in her eyes she knew it was wrong but she couldnt resist her carnal desire she pushed me onto the bed and slowly took her top off taking her time to tease me as much as possible she got on top of me and rested her beautiful breasts on my chest i put my hands on her back and moved them down to her thick ass i spanked her ass and she giggled ever so slightly she whispered in my ear i have to tell you something anything i told her desperate to fulfill my fantasies necessito acerca de tree fiddy it was at this point i realized that marie was stories tall and a crustacean

2007scape,removed,chain mail was especially strong vs edged blades slash and arrows ranged especially because you could realistically cover more body area with it while not hindering fighting ability nope this is not true at all you could cover more area for a sword but it didnt matter because the chainmail would break within a couple of hits full knight armor was still way better for sword fighting especially since they used horses to plow through retards like yourself trying to fight with chainmail on the ground
2007scape,removed,mail was very durable and a near impossible to cut through with a sword nope theres a reason why knights never used it and the spaniards later opted for platebodies rather than chainmails fuck off retard
2007scape,removed,chain mail was garbage and nobody used it now fuck off retard
2007scape,removed,platemail was never the prominent armour in combat look at this retard lmao just look at the spaniard conquistadors my nigga

2007scape,removed,do you have any reading comprehension or are you simply retarded you said its insane how you had to hunt chins for a whip when whips were extremely rare only a complete moron would not see that it is actually completely normal that you had to work that hard for a whip in the early stages of this game i played in the real and i started osrs on the day it was released youre clearly a newfag good thing i can block idiots from you and filter your autism from my inbox what a waste of time youve been
2007scape,removed,i made a thread similar to this no one cared so i took it to mod weath on twitter the next day every bot i reported to him was banned i suggest you do the same make a note of all the players you suspect botting and pass them onto weath hell look into it and ban the players actually botting
2007scape,removed,you might have looted an extra chromosome too be careful what you pick up from other players
2007scape,removed,you cant be this retarded we all just got baited by some bored nerd

2007scape,removed,hi heres a summary of the term strawman a httprationalwikiorgwikistrawman is logical fallacy that occurs when a debater httprationalwikiorgwikiredherring their opponents argument as a weaker version and rebuts that weak fake version rather than their opponents genuine argument intentional strawmanning usually has the goal of avoiding real debate against their opponents real argument because the misrepresenter risks losing in a fair debate or making the opponents position appear ridiculous and thus win over bystanders unintentional misrepresentations are also possible but in this case the misrepresenter would only be guilty of simple ignorance while their argument would still be fallacious they can be at least

2007scape,removed,pure or zerker zerker initiates are a dead build both of them add more variety to my gameplay mixing solo playing and pking well or should i try making a pure again that depends on you you can do almost anything on any account if you want to put in the effort its just easier with higher stats defence being one of those there any good zerk clans compared to the all famous pure defense pure clans im a little biased here but httpwwwtastevengeancecom is pretty good as a whole though the zerkertank clan scene isnt thriving nearly as well as it used to be there are only a few around anymore zerks good at low levels will i be able to brid successfully at around combat id say theyre arguably the best between maybe and combat lower than that and you wont really have the stats to do much if youre looking for low pking youll want to stay prayer love combo pking rangeddsgmaulandotherspecweapons i dont want to be stuck meleeing only is that possible on a zerk very on the higher end of the spectrum ags zerkers usually run msb to ags for a cheap and effective setup it easier to make cash on a zerk again depends on you id say in general it probably is but things like zulrah can be done on a pure just as well as on a zerk

2007scape,removed,poor guy you must have autism you might as well also own up to the fact youve been defending someone who cheated if you can find where they said specifically tanking through the fog is not a legitimate way to win the tournament then i will admit i am wrong jagex made it clear abusing stalls is a disqualification woox abused the npc dialogue to stall several ticks worth of damage to heal ahead of the fog

2007scape,removed,hahahahahahahahahahaha
2007scape,removed,we were are on weekends
2007scape,removed,theres a lot more than just cosmetic armour in this picture yes im not particularly happy about the art design in the game either
2007scape,removed,i dont have a phone so fuck off give everyone same security or dont
2007scape,removed,why not introdcute eyetechnology then why not have your webcam open up and scan your fingerprints to actually log in why not have an option to only log in if you got the right blood type why not support that fucking losers just because you cant secure your account or stay away from double xp doesnt need devs need to waste their fucking time updating security because the average rs player is a fucking moron
2007scape,removed,its almost as if some people dont want to be spied on and have a tracker in their pockets go back to ur apps
2007scape,removed,auth is already completely useless smd
2007scape,removed,fucking incredible
2007scape,removed,bikers is aids and retarded hes not funny at all keep him cleared
2007scape,removed,successful at being the most hated person by this community hell im pretty sure more people hate him more than emily faking cancer
2007scape,removed,when is steameryoutuber boomepickill rsn stimulant going to be banned he uses dozens upon dozens of peoples accounts all the time i have no idea how he convinces so many people to share or give their accounts to him boomepickill is constantly account sharing with who knows how many people he pks on tons of other peoples accounts and blocks the names so no one can report it i have no idea how he is able to get this many people to share accounts with him this is just one of many many examples on his youtube jagex should look into this and see if he is rwt on a massive scale
2007scape,removed,tldr op is an idiot and bikers is an absolute piece of human garbage thats what you get for being friends with losers i laugh at this op you played yourself
2007scape,removed,stfu you twat woox won fair and square he didnt abuse any bugs he didnt cheat death he ate food he deserves the for being the smartest one first winner tick ate still paid him second used prayer to stay alive both then against the rules all woox did was eat food he didnt cheat he was the smartest and won
2007scape,removed,the fuck u talkin bout nigger
2007scape,removed,i played lms with bikers i can tell hes a faggot and understand why people wouldnt like him u shared your account thats against the rules furthermore they can do whatever they want with any account and dont need to explain why jagex owns your account
2007scape,removed,no jmod commnet i am sure they read this but it seems like its one of those issues they will sweep under the rug i sold my account i rwtd it and i dont play the game anymore and im glad im not this company is retarded
2007scape,removed,this isnt funny and no one cares you obese americans leave your stupid politics out of runescape
2007scape,removed,i think theres a big amount of people who dont support either purespam or bikers but breaking the exact same rule should be punished equally and not a perm ban in one case and not even a warning in the other case
2007scape,removed,good riddance less cancer in the game
2007scape,removed,well no fucking shit that you cant imagine yourself doing all do actually realize how much autism wasted hours that takes
2007scape,removed,jagex doesnt owe you shit cunt
2007scape,removed,just gonna leave this here
2007scape,removed,not to be the jackass that goes against the circlejerk have you ever thought about it this way jagex has been known to look the other way for not only streamers but also other players for account sharing and giving my rs friend did it with another friend and everything went fine maybe perhaps the reason why the banned it is because they have severe hatred towards you i dont intend to be rude or make any remarks but lets be real here bikers as well as the majority of purple army is a bunch of drooling retards that add to the cancer of this game you say to push the fact that i am part of the purple army aside when it is a main reason to consider no offense but bikers is a complete cancerous and intoxicating member to this community so perhaps there is reason in that
2007scape,removed,could this be an epic new meme
2007scape,removed,
2007scape,removed,bikers is such an attention whore
2007scape,removed,could this be an epic new meme

2007scape,removed,please dont if you dont know what youre doing you may stumble upon a server that will capitalise on clueless osrs players just to get their private details and whatever else they can get their hands on however if you even consider playing any of these servers and i dont condone you do do not use your existing usernamesemailspasswords for any of the registration details they tend to get leaked and if you absolutely have to pick the most popular server to minimise the chance to get targeted and for extra security you could use the httpwwwsandboxiecom program to run the client in a safe environment where it cannot install anything malicious on your computer
2007scape,removed,jesus this isnt even remotely in the same galaxy as being close to how fucking dumb are you lol
2007scape,removed,you put up with this fine specimen of autism longer than i could have how do you do it

2007scape,removed,it amazes me how many people come here to ask braindead level questions instead of googling it and finding an archived retard asking the same braindead question or maybe even figuring it out themselves the only thing you achieve is looking like a complete clown
2007scape,removed,holy shit he wasnt trolling hes actually a fucking retard so happy you got hacked bro rip to your you spent on that haha

2007scape,removed,how would that even prove anything since we know this is definitely voice we can go ahead and ban him
2007scape,removed,alfie doesnt deserve a hcim with how stupid he is with them hafez should just ban him from making hcim

2007scape,removed,do you mean like a model from what ive read about it its very difficult to get the actual models from the games cache due to the format and programs jagex uses and even if you did get it you probably wouldnt be able to view it in a modern program like blender weirdly enough though utottty created a unity webpage that lets you view any ingame model it only lets you rotatezoom and idk about downloading it if you need the actual model hes the only person ive seen that might be able to help
2007scape,removed,great to the see happiness come from the more special area of our community warms my heart to see a man with autism and stage downsyndrome can enjoy this game just like everyone else

2007scape,removed,for the part where you need to blow up the airship drink a lot beforehand youll need it to dull the pain for the gorillas in the cave i found it best to kill one of the nonwinged ones first then immediately kill the winged one that drops down that way you only have to tank one nonwinged at all times and focus on praying the rest killing both nonwinged means you have to tank at least one winged gorilla which i found much harder personally for glough bring super restores sara brews sharks or better and optional last slot being an rcbacb you can safespot his first form quite easily by getting him stuck on the i think north wall entering the passageway the wall to the right as you face him the second form can also be safespotted though a little more tricky pray range while luring him to these spots one after another until he stops moving in the final spot he will stop attacking will include pics soon in an edit you can safespot the first two forms with a blowpipe on longrange for form or your optional crossbow your blowpipe is for the final kill shoutouts to will include namelink in an edit shortly for showing me this method but essentially you do the following enable autoretaliate blowpipe on rapid pray protect frombmage and eagle eye run into the room and glough will pull you towards him straight after you recover your character will automatically attack instantly after that attack walk one square from glough and quickly click him again you should get two attacks in and take under damage in the two ticks you attack you can replace attacking with drinking one restorebrew or eatingcomboeating only do one action per tick and dont get ahead of yourself try not to go below if i explained the method badly ill have a video linked soon showing it off best of luck

2007scape,removed,i think its about the scuffed pj mechanics in the game atm if you are fighting someone and all he does is run away he will eventually run past aggresive mobs these wont aggro to him since hes already under attack by you but they will aggro to you the pker since you arent being attacked back once you are under attack by the mob you are unable to attack your target anymore this allows him to gain free distance on you without being freezed or he chooses to box a mob close his client and force a logout on his character in seconds for an easy escape its retarded and is what ruins a lot of potential kills for example green dragons is a really popular spot for people to train ranged and make big amounts of money when a pker comes here they will run to the graveyard where there are aggresive skeletons this is pretty much a escape if you manage to survive the second run to the place which is pretty damn easy with protection prayers

2007scape,removed,when i check the sub and constantly see this annoying childmans clips theyre rarely labeled in such an obvious fashion of being his and im sick of having to waste time avoiding his shit his content is not worthy enough to be seen by my eyes
2007scape,removed,he acts like a man version of the wiggles or some other bs overblown dramatic childrens show constantly poisons his streams with complete bullshit like singinggetting up from his fucking chair to do stupid shit in his cam dont know how anyone thats an adult can actually tolerate watching him through all that bullshit wtfs the point of watching a runescape stream when runescape seems to a not be the center of his stream singing and dancing and gallavanting about and b not being played well bc his personal limitations
2007scape,removed,yes because quantifying an actual reason is clearly just crying fucking idiot
2007scape,removed,a i have given him like chances and i would not stand up and watch him b the reason why people watch him is the exact reason that i hate seeing his shit then its the exact opposite of what i find entertaining and i know others who also think that way and thats the type of people i hang around
2007scape,removed,how people find him to be entertainment is literally incomprehensible when streaming goes from gameplay to lets focus on entertaining people with me instead of with my gameplay is a very good way for me to hate a streamer

2007scape,removed,generalizations are usually based on truth and obviously exceptions always exist for example if people say all niggers are dumb its obviously a generalization but statistically black people are less educated than white people due to being born in poverty more often than white and then having worse acces to education etc and obviously that doesnt mean that obama is stupid just because he is black

2007scape,removed,because you called one the n word and you wrote out the word faggot there is literally a famous john mulaney joke about this when you call nigger the n word youre part of what youre questioning

2007scape,removed,keep saying that to yourself as you watch the player counter slowly fall into oblivion im sure it will help
2007scape,removed,the way it is setup is this mousemove x y being the fastest and being the slowest speed httpsautohotkeycomdocscommandsmousemovehtmparameters most ahk scripts are setup as but im not sure if mousekeys themselves are instant speed for ahk so i dont know how going up speed would make any difference

2007scape,removed,youre actually an idiot
2007scape,removed,are you a fucking idiot you dont make your security more secure because then less people would use it what is the point of security if you can just bypass it its like locking your car door with the windows down holy shit
2007scape,removed,lmao a y
2007scape,removed,you have literally zero idea what a data subset for a image is dont even reply if youre this stupid
2007scape,removed,and since youre a no life fanboy who doesnt go outside go fuck yourself
2007scape,not_removed,i wouldnt say that raids failed at longevity players just got burnt out with them you can say the same about most bosses or similar content like sire or cerberus at first it was everywhere and now it is less common with raids i think it is especially so due to the amount of time between drops which makes it less entertaining to watch still players do still do and stream raids but it just isnt the popular thing now anyway i dont really think longevity is much of a concern but hopefully will see prif or menaphos
2007scape,not_removed,rewards are too rare one rare drop in ish hours is just too lowassuming you do a points run every
2007scape,not_removed,ill write a bigass post about why raids dropped off like a cliff and how to make raiding last for a really long time ive just been waiting until everybody has been thoroughly burnt out with the monotony of raiding
2007scape,not_removed,id say they were much too repetitive unlike dungeoneering where there was more of a progression that you could build upon raids along with most of osrs these days is mainly based on grinding as said recently by a few bigger streamers you need to do tons of raids to be rewarded i know people who have gone raids dry thats minutes of doing something that is pretty fun times over and over even if you do really well points per player you run a high risk of getting a couple hundred k for an hours work i think osrs needs some tiered content in the near future i know this risks going in the direction of but lets be honest preeoc was a lot of fun the early days of dungeoneering were the peak of rs there isnt any endgame content right now where you can advance up a leader board or invest hours in something in order to unlock new content a shift towards this would do osrs good
2007scape,not_removed,theres a long downtime between drops and the average loots isnt as good its like gwd mediocre average drops but the length for each kill before a profitable drop basically it has a huge time investment that most ppl would rather do zulrah instead
2007scape,not_removed,people want instant gratification because zulrah ruined the game same reason why corp is not really that popular
2007scape,not_removed,simply for me it was just not beneficial enough i sunk plus hours into raids and maybe maybe only setting eyes on one rare drop almost all other bosses in osrs would have yielded more gp granted i could have been unlucky but im not spending another hours to find out coz i coukd get that d harpoon and then id be upset
2007scape,not_removed,because the best rewards that would have been worth billions were voted down by a tiny minority twisted armor and elder armor that is the root cause of raids not being worth doing therefore less people are interested in them
2007scape,not_removed,most my friends stopped because were around dry considering our trios took around minutes before the box and other qol updates thats a huge amount of time spent with nothing to show for it i just want drop rates released
2007scape,not_removed,i was really irritated the community voted no to the other armours
2007scape,not_removed,karamja store you mean the place that has an npc specifically for unnoting items
2007scape,not_removed,cya mate
2007scape,not_removed,because that is easily abuseable
2007scape,not_removed,i would highly suggest to make cosmic runes instead for battlestaves and just buy nature runes from shops until you can use the abyss or have a quick teleport to fairy rings slayer ringquest cape
2007scape,not_removed,brb kms
2007scape,not_removed,not if its your own stock really ironman should be able to buy and sell their own items
2007scape,not_removed,i hate when i buy a wyvern bot and they reclaim it
2007scape,not_removed,sounds more like you bought an acc if theyre already killing wyverns on it
2007scape,not_removed,my cc has been tracking the account for the last hour i tryd to sign in today and it said that my user and pass was invalid both my accounts have been hacked please help
2007scape,not_removed,can confirm i found it killing wyverns in only void
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt jagex support fuck off

2007scape,not_removed,cam firmed is con can
2007scape,not_removed,conker is firm fam
2007scape,not_removed,why does it feel like this guy is level everytime i see a screenshot of him lol training in both the recent pics too
2007scape,not_removed,messaging frinds asking how to screen shot this is adorable
2007scape,not_removed,zezima slaying basilisks with a rune med oo what even
2007scape,not_removed,did you fucking talk to him op
2007scape,not_removed,i got a crush on zezima who member berries this song
2007scape,not_removed,a shill of his former self
2007scape,not_removed,the legend has finally left lumbridge
2007scape,not_removed,dont let this distract you from the fact that in the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted feet through an announcers table
2007scape,not_removed,had no clue he had picked up osrs i thought he said he would never play it
2007scape,not_removed,i messaged him earlier but he didnt respond
2007scape,not_removed,who
2007scape,not_removed,definitely a great friend of yours whats up my nerds afk wcing that sounds like a blast
2007scape,not_removed,who
2007scape,not_removed,how old is this pic he is combat currently
2007scape,not_removed,no idea but theres nothing like seeing your childhood hero slay with an addy med helm addy chain and steel boots it was surreal haha
2007scape,not_removed,i heard somewhere that the person using that account isnt actually zezima but its still interesting
2007scape,not_removed,much prefer he learns than another phone picture show up here
2007scape,not_removed,at least he knows who zezima is i guess
2007scape,not_removed,its actually an addy med i think
2007scape,not_removed,wot n zezimanation
2007scape,not_removed,addy med you filthy casual
2007scape,not_removed,you know whats funny i didnt even notice it was him till like minutes later cause nobody expects the most famous scaper to be doing slayer with addy armor lmao when i found out i flipped but didnt bother him too much
2007scape,not_removed,please dont say that
2007scape,not_removed,or the zezima song from the barrows brothers rap video
2007scape,not_removed,rcomedycemetery
2007scape,not_removed,zezima im into you not in that way but the other way dude
2007scape,not_removed,i can not wait for this brand new update
2007scape,not_removed,i member
2007scape,not_removed,honestly i think hes just playing casual and enjoying himself something most of us forget to do
2007scape,not_removed,wait are you serious
2007scape,not_removed,delet this
2007scape,not_removed,no hes not i just looked him up and hes combat legit curious how you managed to think hes
2007scape,not_removed,rcutenoobs
2007scape,not_removed,nah its for sure zezima high profile accounts like this would not last long at all under a hackers or thieves hands
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,shouldve talked to him you never know he couldve became your best friend and then youd become famous for being friends with zezima but you didnt talk to him so now that is a fantasy good job op
2007scape,not_removed,me too t hanks
2007scape,not_removed,if you watch his streams at all thats exactly what he says hes doing he has no plans of playing competitively anymore like he did on
2007scape,not_removed,yeah when it released he said the fun of it was gone and he didnt want to redo everything hed already done once
2007scape,not_removed,prob mixed osrs and hasnt seen progress in years years
2007scape,not_removed,lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,lold at work
2007scape,not_removed,oh nooo
2007scape,not_removed,i did talk to him he said hi and never talked again
2007scape,not_removed,thats an impossible mix to make since hes kinda famous for maxing
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,hes a man of few words i found him once and told him a joke and all i got was a lol
2007scape,not_removed,technically hes right because hasnt existed for years and hes hardly played
2007scape,not_removed,should read his ama shortest answers ever and pretty vague dude really likes playing the mysterious type of player and its always suited was never known for talking much but didnt ignore
2007scape,not_removed,hes got on
2007scape,not_removed,hes been streaming for months recently
2007scape,not_removed,he literally maxed on and he still plays it now he plays osrs sometimes as well to mix up his streams a bit
2007scape,not_removed,huh he loves
2007scape,not_removed,no bullshit he actually streams
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,yeah httpstwitchtvzezimarunescape
2007scape,not_removed,yeah quite a bit he plays osrs for fun and he plays seriously
2007scape,not_removed,probably pking and making bank from the dcs tbh
2007scape,not_removed,yes this has actually been confirmed to be the case
2007scape,not_removed,its probably fishy salty kid gets banned on sight
2007scape,not_removed,probably the same kids who mass hacked people today
2007scape,not_removed,source
2007scape,not_removed,that whip in my invy was kills before also got monkey tail crystal and light balista in gorilla kills tonight crazy
2007scape,not_removed,le boys
2007scape,not_removed,why dint you pick up the first abysally dagger but let it be on the ground
2007scape,not_removed,its every
2007scape,not_removed,ive heard a couple times from unreliable sources that your run restore rate is effectively doubled at
2007scape,not_removed,lvl full gracefull
2007scape,not_removed,check the runescape agility wikipedia
2007scape,not_removed,source
2007scape,not_removed,you have no proof but ive heard its every
2007scape,not_removed,tomato please
2007scape,not_removed,i have read forum post where some one did the math couldnt find it any more from rs forums it said also this could be easily tested thou by someone who has low agility
2007scape,not_removed,he doesnt have a proof and neither do i but ive heard its
2007scape,not_removed,random dude started singing the lyrics i figured id join in
2007scape,not_removed,its a cool place and they say it gets colder
2007scape,not_removed,he stopped literally at the chorus
2007scape,not_removed,was that at barb fishing
2007scape,not_removed,monkfish i think as he says in the title
2007scape,not_removed,shrimp in lumbridge obviously
2007scape,not_removed,thats just how the boulder wants to play
2007scape,not_removed,basically the boulder attack will appear behind the wall and you wont be able to see it until its too late
2007scape,not_removed,does this happen only when you tilt your camera in a certain way a lot of things clip through wallsobjects at certain camera angles
2007scape,not_removed,surprise motherfucker
2007scape,not_removed,i know this is a question but i just wanna say that i really like this picture for some reason
2007scape,not_removed,the whole north side of the gorilla cave is completely fucked so many clipping issues not just with the boulder attacks
2007scape,not_removed,wait did i just see that gorilla praying or is there a player beneath him
2007scape,not_removed,i just move step every time gorilla beats his chest to be safe
2007scape,not_removed,also happens undernear the archway between the entrance room and the first multi way room annoying but easily avoidable really
2007scape,not_removed,whatever is going on with the crash site walls is the same issues that occur in zeah catacombs the walls just dont behave nicely with objects in front of them sometimes
2007scape,not_removed,and please increase the click radius
2007scape,not_removed,doubt it been like that since release and probs will take too much engine work
2007scape,not_removed,engine work doubt they will
2007scape,not_removed,why tassets
2007scape,not_removed,its a second fix they just gotta change the zindex
2007scape,not_removed,lmao where did this meme start
2007scape,not_removed,its how the camera is angled and where you are jn the game unfortunately it would require engine work
2007scape,not_removed,yes id you have your camera angled down on the player you can see it fall makes gorillas annoying if you rotate your camera weirdly
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,you seen the gorilla playing theyre like tormented demons from preeoc pretty much
2007scape,not_removed,hes praying for harambe to come back
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,what else would you use afaik everyone uses tassets
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,people complained about ragging archie said thats just how they want to pk
2007scape,not_removed,yea i remember hearing some explanation about how wall kits in that area just do that kind of was hoping there was some progress since the quest came out if there hasnt been then a good alternative might be if your character suddenly appeared a few shades darker as if theyre under the shadow of the boulder however im not sure if thats possible in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,vskirt is arguably better for the pray bonus
2007scape,not_removed,its not just there iirc there are also bugs at poh redwood trees just to list a pair most likely this is a large engine job work otherwise it would have been corrected for poh update
2007scape,not_removed,that close to a bank theres no way a small extra prayer bonus is better than the extra dps not to mention they drop fairly frequent prayer potions
2007scape,not_removed,like the str bonus is better than range att from blessed d hide ditch the top too and take blessed d hide
2007scape,not_removed,its all fun and games until u slash yourself in the face
2007scape,not_removed,would of been better if you didnt add the cx in it
2007scape,not_removed,fucking stupid
2007scape,not_removed,cx ruins it
2007scape,not_removed,upvotes but comments something fishy going on
2007scape,not_removed,seriously still not handled name changing is ready
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,op what the name of the accounts you never told us in any of the threads im curious
2007scape,not_removed,how do you get a name from the release ive tried making an account but i dont know what names are being released if someone can link me a list
2007scape,not_removed,ty for the discussion we had gl
2007scape,not_removed,is a desired name therefore ban him
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think you should have got banned or your names revoked but i dont think you should have had all those names seems like you got a little greedy with good names and jagex probably saw all the name change requests from one ip and just said narrrr
2007scape,not_removed,give up elite dust u aint getting ur stakers back
2007scape,not_removed,you know i get youre mad but quit reposting this same shit with no edits its spam at this point
2007scape,not_removed,i saw this being advertised in a twitch stream
2007scape,not_removed,i reported him to reddit admins his account for suspended for vote manipulation
2007scape,not_removed,what stream was this posted on
2007scape,not_removed,wow good job you are amazing reddit should hire you to become an admin
2007scape,not_removed,i really liked the robes of subjugation from zammy gwd on id support something similar
2007scape,not_removed,i think it would make more sense to come from a new boss behind the frozen door or all of it from zamorak we really dont need another magic amulet either also i wouldnt expect this to get magic damage if kodai doesnt magic damage would make this easily outclass kodai
2007scape,not_removed,ahrims is tier mage adding another set would be pointless
2007scape,not_removed,yes i get dced and it says login limit exceeded i cant even play the game atm cause its so bad
2007scape,not_removed,i have no idea im from new zealand tho using osbuddy client
2007scape,not_removed,if youre not questing early level farming what are you doing
2007scape,not_removed,est
2007scape,not_removed,thank you very much
2007scape,not_removed,thats when the final hour livestream starts the next season starts around bst est
2007scape,not_removed,train my account for me and ill recover it back when youre done
2007scape,not_removed,hammy down handme down
2007scape,not_removed,are you actually that dumb that you think people will fall for this shit give me your account so i can release your pet and drop all your untradeables
2007scape,not_removed,dont know what stupider you asking people to email you when they can send you a private message on reddit or you actually thinking this scam would work
2007scape,not_removed,account with those stats is worth like what dollars obvious scam
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,dumb people posts would love this
2007scape,not_removed,lol just looked it up i guess hammy down is the slang for it never seen anyone use it that way though but thats coming from a guy who says crick instead of creek
2007scape,not_removed,but do you also vape
2007scape,not_removed,your whole crew we will wake the fuck up
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,go to falador mine coal spot and usually no bots
2007scape,not_removed,less bots maybe but still plenty of player competition there shouldnt be a designated bot zone
2007scape,not_removed,sadly all of ftp is a designated bot zone
2007scape,not_removed,proof
2007scape,not_removed,proof of what dude
2007scape,not_removed,ive gotten smouldering stones
2007scape,not_removed,do waterfall quest gnomes quest theres fight arena from great combat xp then you can quest more or to make money you can go kill some chaos druids for herbs something i did when i first go member i made a schedule like days gonna train my accounts stats quest slayer or anything and then the last week gonna focus on making money because if you only focus on making money at low level you will never get higher lvl where the money is easier to make
2007scape,not_removed,how the f fdid u make mill and only got these stats
2007scape,not_removed,i would do most or all of the quests before cashing in your bond you will have to do most of them later anyway you could make money through combat killing choas druids they are really easy to kill and drop lots of herbs at peak efficiency you can make over but you will probably start at around you want to find something that you can make with and at low requirements for your first skill to train smithing iron bars at blast furnace is around and is pretty easy to get the levels for check out the on the wiki for other options for making money runecrafting and hunter make good money but require lots of time investment before they become profitable as well as being tedious
2007scape,not_removed,use your money to get higher cooking first cooking can be a good member skill to make money as the higher tier stuff like sharks or kawarms can be bought raw and sold cooked for profit easily do an hour very afk for more active money maker runecrafting is very good for a solo skill requirement although for abyss running youd want higher mining and agility that said you really should get all of your starts to atleast first cooking to if you wanna ez method for money and magiccombat skills to youll get more out of membership that way also do agility first thing as a member great to get run energy back faster also works when your again
2007scape,not_removed,tbh i reckon you gotta focus on making bonds first then you can have ages of no worries and just enjoying members secure your membership first just in case its harder than you expect to make a bond or in case you have a change of circumstances and cant spend time getting a bond at the end of the week
2007scape,not_removed,you could do blast furnace for sweet profits tood with steel bars
2007scape,not_removed,i think it hasnt been mentioned but train your farming from lvl when you can farm ranarr weeds you nake over per run of minutes which you can make every hour and a half so logging minutes times a day makes you some really easy cash
2007scape,not_removed,do quests for farming then do ranarr runs per run and it takes like mins to grow
2007scape,not_removed,agility is a good one to get out of the way since its benefits carry into
2007scape,not_removed,this is almost exactly what you need to do the first days should be questingskillingcombat training the rest of it should be spent making the next bond or two
2007scape,not_removed,thanks ideally what combat levels should i go for and then what should i specifically do for money making
2007scape,not_removed,anyone got a spare rune scim or random drop parties and ge magic
2007scape,not_removed,awesome thanks for that ill make sure to do all those quests
2007scape,not_removed,thanks man awesome i will give it a crack
2007scape,not_removed,thanks victory i might pass just as it takes ages in to save up for the bond worse case it would be more time efficient for me to buy one irl
2007scape,not_removed,ill have a look at that thanks fangs
2007scape,not_removed,or do that and fit something else in there
2007scape,not_removed,to add to this fairy tale part i is a huge mobility boost in fairy rings when you start ft ii and a big farming level boost from level
2007scape,not_removed,farming
2007scape,not_removed,ill definitely do that thanks man
2007scape,not_removed,good tip ill make sure to boost it some thanks
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,damn you are really lazy
2007scape,not_removed,of course but i meant he doesnt need to play hard to aford a bond just logging for farming runs times a day nets him a bond in under days
2007scape,not_removed,awesome ill add it to my todo list thank you
2007scape,not_removed,shit yeah
2007scape,not_removed,thats probably how he did it without any stats
2007scape,not_removed,i really like that farming idea thanks you i will totally look into it more
2007scape,not_removed,sorry i didnt know you werent op please accept my apologies sorry
2007scape,not_removed,a lot of it was drop parties but i did manage to loot a lot when i was lvl i know these stats are pretty crap but i dont beg haha
2007scape,not_removed,ring of recoil charges are attached on player side thats why you get fully charged ring if someone dies in wildy with that it requires engine work for that
2007scape,not_removed,or how about make rune pouches tradable that way it would have worth some kind of value risk in pvp and its really the only thing people buy emblems for
2007scape,not_removed,i chose a book for reading
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i believe this would fix the issue with gold farmers who multi log with a rare cmb lvl like cmb and kill their other accounts made a video about this issue and discussed it more in depth
2007scape,not_removed,uh oh player interaction cant have that
2007scape,not_removed,interesting how emblems go up steadily over time they were ea i think when i bought a pouch
2007scape,not_removed,are you guys dumb go grind out bounty for that shit lets make void tradeable too then as well as torso and all fighter equipment
2007scape,not_removed,engine work
2007scape,not_removed,no that will devalue you emblem collection which took year
2007scape,not_removed,please
2007scape,not_removed,uh remember the mass inflation due to statuettes no support
2007scape,not_removed,locking pvm content behind a pvp minigame oh jagex
2007scape,not_removed,bobos g maul very credible cc where i got my pouch from
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,while were at it make all tiers tradeable its silly that tier is more expensive than tier when you count the gp tier gets you in alchables
2007scape,not_removed,they should just be untradeable tbh
2007scape,not_removed,id prefer the thing where it breaks if you get killed and then pay a certain amount to repair it and of that payment goes to the person who killed you
2007scape,not_removed,im actually against it having them be only tradeable player to player means that they are traded somewhere which is edge bank on which gets more people are there which supports the mini game in of itself
2007scape,not_removed,people that buy are hilarious saps anyway
2007scape,not_removed,they would crash really hard theres tons of people who have of medhigh tier emblems if half of them cash their emblems out the pouches will be a few in the first day not saying this is bad or good just pointing it out d
2007scape,not_removed,this is a brilliant solution if the puches were tradable then you could use your embelms and pretty much sell on g e
2007scape,not_removed,e n g i n e w o r k
2007scape,not_removed,i agree with this guy
2007scape,not_removed,problem is that you can have only one pouch at time they would have to allow have multiple pouches idk is that good idea
2007scape,not_removed,they cant be noted
2007scape,not_removed,it was something to do with the nature of the emblems code they couldnt just add it to the ge item table like a normal item because its scripted as something else if i remember correctly
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt encourage anybody its not like if a pvmer wants it he is gonna be like okay maybe i should get it myself he is pretty much gonna buy it guarnteed
2007scape,not_removed,httpstwittercomjagexash ajosrs to encourage people to get the rewards by playing bh themselves rather than trading emblems in bulk this message was created by a bot
2007scape,not_removed,with that logic embles should just be non tradable
2007scape,not_removed,yeah im the one who told him about it shame his video is completely misinformed as he doesnt even have a basic understanding of the tier system
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i got them for ea on my main then like a month later i was spending ea on my pure
2007scape,not_removed,this wouldnt have the same affect specifically because it doesnt change the amount of gp being brought into the game if i trade an emblem to another player they can buy alchables but its the same alchables id be buying if anything less alchables will be bought short term on release as players buy emblemsrune pouches
2007scape,not_removed,no already enough tier scammers
2007scape,not_removed,nothing wrong with buying tier nearly everyone who does has probably affiliation with pvp and just wants a rune pouch as safely and quickly as possible
2007scape,not_removed,well tell me how can you directly sell a higher tier to anyone
2007scape,not_removed,they will crash but they would be capped at around due to the alch price of other items in the store
2007scape,not_removed,yeh thats true but thats a good thing as the price can be accurately represented
2007scape,not_removed,runepouches wouldnt be able to crash below like each
2007scape,not_removed,why would it be a bad idea
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,it does encourage people to abuse the bounty hunter system get a lot of tiers and they can sell them on the ge yeah they cost a piece by these flippers but you can sit there and wait and buy them at or if you have patient you just dont like to wait
2007scape,not_removed,easier to buy from ge than in person
2007scape,not_removed,if only bhpking wasnt god awful in this game community and game mechanics both being contributing factors
2007scape,not_removed,how can you scam an untradeable item
2007scape,not_removed,its only too well worth it for that pouch carrying blood barrages in one slot worth
2007scape,not_removed,same with me except i bought a tier for much less than tier and had points to spend on other things took about minutes in a credible cc basically there are way too many in the game for them to cost seeing as theyre farmed and they come of the time from each target kill
2007scape,not_removed,dont be a scamming douche and eventually make a name for yourself so people know youre trusted to buy tiers from
2007scape,not_removed,well they would if theyre dropped on death and people oversaturate the market the first few days imagine if everyday pkers collectively buy more rune pouches than there are players who will buy one even at
2007scape,not_removed,if you need runes suddenly it goes from slots to slots if you can have more than one pouch
2007scape,not_removed,i dunno if its if its been a meme for more than a year
2007scape,not_removed,yea i mean having it outside of ge is just an inconvenience since it doesnt actually make more ppl go pking also people will be risking them in wildy when they can be bought from ge so it adds more risk
2007scape,not_removed,community yes mechanics no pking is a lot more skill based than people think
2007scape,not_removed,tradeable on death only so someone has to go first
2007scape,not_removed,why are you commenting on something you have no idea what it is about and making a statement instead of asking what it is
2007scape,not_removed,u can also just try to match ur friend as a targ after buying a attempts per really isnt bad odds get enough points for rune pouches and some change
2007scape,not_removed,what cc did you use im looking to get a too
2007scape,not_removed,directly but this isnt directly
2007scape,not_removed,yeah this works
2007scape,not_removed,they cost bh points equiv to like in rune alchables
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure they could come to a solution for that eg every rune pouch shares one instance of storage so no matter which you open they all contain the same runes
2007scape,not_removed,price will go down a bit for sure though
2007scape,not_removed,it does make more people go pking
2007scape,not_removed,by mechanics i specifically mean broken things like tick eating to survive being abused by dharok pkers atm and whatever the current pid situation is
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt even make a statement i asked a question which im pretty sure is the exact opposite of what you just said
2007scape,not_removed,how can you scam an untradeable item looks like he is asking what it is tbh and as najda explained you pay someone who is supposed to die with a tier x so you get it instead they just log or tell you to go fuck yourself ect
2007scape,not_removed,i know if people bought them on release day expecting to sell for so they spent all their points theyve saved up for months and all the people who are going to buy one could not meet the supply pkers would continue to try to sell what they already bought and it would crash the price below alch value its an improbable scenario but its one where the rune pouch would go under pointsalch value
2007scape,not_removed,youll find very few dhers risk pid eating because for one pid can suddenly swap and youre fucked then as well as that if youre a tick late trying to tick eat youre very dead of the time i pid eats its accidental
2007scape,not_removed,lol people like me would happily spend on an item thats under its alchemy value
2007scape,not_removed,iirc roq suggested this after having numerous requests on qa so id imagine hed put it in too
2007scape,not_removed,gf acc
2007scape,not_removed,hate to be that guy but go to zulrah to make money to chin itll be much more efficient
2007scape,not_removed,blowpipe is almost gphr
2007scape,not_removed,you need mage for zulrah too though dont you
2007scape,not_removed,im nowhere near that much less than that
2007scape,not_removed,you can do range only itll just be slower any reason why you dont want to train mage
2007scape,not_removed,its constant combat so with banking and waiting for respawn id assume around
2007scape,not_removed,id personally need to train mage before doing it only currently
2007scape,not_removed,its a little less than a percent each run so including darts is probably close
2007scape,not_removed,if you have ranged it might be faster to solo range then might take minutes each kill but dont quote me on that
2007scape,not_removed,if you have ranged it might be faster to solo range then might take minutes each kill but dont quote me on that uforgotmypassword
2007scape,not_removed,i think that jagex should announce when they are going to ban him so we can at least say farewell
2007scape,not_removed,sometimes you have great posts
2007scape,not_removed,this is not one of them
2007scape,not_removed,blow pipe slayer with cannon and sellalch drops youll profit in the end
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,range cost me like so im guessing its around no prayers exp per hour blow pipping slayer is profit in the long run
2007scape,not_removed,at tunnels with grey chins
2007scape,not_removed,close to with chins
2007scape,not_removed,or approximately of a schmekle
2007scape,not_removed,jagex has no power over it that all lies on twitch and theyre not doing anything for some reason
2007scape,not_removed,people just need to get over twitch most of the streamers are terrible with a few notable exceptions ice doesnt even have bgloves and cant get an fcape on a maxed account with maxed gear for instance
2007scape,not_removed,that isnt even his account lol
2007scape,not_removed,people dont watch ice for his runescape skills but instead his personality he still pulls in viewers how many do you get
2007scape,not_removed,i dontcant stream my internet is too bad
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,i see what you did there

2007scape,not_removed,damn at least they arent having trouble connecting to the servers
2007scape,not_removed,a sucker is born every second run a virus scan for good measure change password gl on rebuild be a little more skeptical next time
2007scape,not_removed,for future reference events like double exp would be posted on the runescape homepage so far there have been none on osrs you should always verify the link on the website you are logging in at is the real one i know most browsers to some extent will offer warnings when you are using an illegitimate site but that doesnt always happen the browser address bar should look exactly like this httpimgurcomavstld if it says anything else do not use it to log in
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for letting them continue the scam
2007scape,not_removed,just thought id make you homies aware if ur not already
2007scape,not_removed,so dont post the link here advertising it you secret scammer
2007scape,not_removed,no need to run a scan these guys operate on fucking idiots who just straight up give their info away
2007scape,not_removed,and remember its not paranoia when youre on the internet people really are out to get you
2007scape,not_removed,anyone who reads this post clicks the link and gives them their info deserves to be scammed
2007scape,not_removed,better safe than sorry also the sort of people that fall for this sort of scam have probably fallen for others
2007scape,not_removed,you are one of those guys because someone falls for a scam they deserve it what a sad person to say something like this p
2007scape,not_removed,did you even read my reply if you read this post which states that he went to this particular stream and entered his acc info for dxp but only got hacked in the process losing all of his items any simple minded grader would realize to not click on the link and do what he did however if you are stupid enough to do so you deserved it
2007scape,not_removed,depends on the bossing you are doing your stats and your other gear
2007scape,not_removed,is if the dwh would be a valuable weapon to keep for bossing or would i be better off selling and investing in other gear it really depends on what the rest of your gear looks like your current stats and what bosses you want to kill dwh is the best spec weapon at a lot of bosses but investing in skills prayerconstruction may be a better option
2007scape,not_removed,personal preference i use the dwh mainly at corp kq and site for gwd the bgs is my first choice if i go for defence reduction the dwh had a good spec but its accuracy isent that great in my opinion a dwh should be something you buy when you have your other gear and stats sorted
2007scape,not_removed,path of exile is basically diablo with a way more indepth skill point system it also has an online marketplace for trading unlike diablo
2007scape,not_removed,i have a friend that went from runescape to archeage and loves it super grindy amazing graphics and its free
2007scape,not_removed,heard somewhere albion online is very much like runescape a big pure clan eos even moved to it a while back
2007scape,not_removed,archeages devs killed their game in the span of weeks dont bother playing that ghost town
2007scape,not_removed,its very like runescape except a lot more grindy only played a bit put off by the fact pvm only drops gold everything is player created i like grinding drops if you like that though and enjoy pvp and clanning it will suit you
2007scape,not_removed,is albion free to play
2007scape,not_removed,congratulations to alithegoat for finding me on the second floor of the falador barber shop
2007scape,not_removed,i have very conveniently left a large stack of coins steps from the wilderness ditch just north of the bar northeast of varrock its behind a tree first person to bring their entire bank with them can collect it there may be an extra surprise for you once you get there
2007scape,not_removed,i love seeing this kind of thing keep it up
2007scape,not_removed,fally upstairs barber shop
2007scape,not_removed,id like to buy some trout
2007scape,not_removed,ty
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty happy i knew where this was right away dang good for you for doing this
2007scape,not_removed,ow are you gonna feature me in your youtube intro
2007scape,not_removed,grats
2007scape,not_removed,oohhh you lucky son of a congratulations
2007scape,not_removed,i know you are being like woah look this was cool and unexpected but every one of these posts make me sad on how i have skills in the and with no skill pets like i just want a squirrel or rock golem or like anything pls
2007scape,not_removed,i got a heron at level fishing about days ago while barb fishing i tried doing slayer and got killed by a vampire didnt insure it
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,i went all the way to and didnt get it
2007scape,not_removed,as someoen who hasnt played in forever what is everyone happy for you for all i can tell is wc and a chat message
2007scape,not_removed,new bot acc shame
2007scape,not_removed,bless your soul young one
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,he got a rare pet very early rngeesus
2007scape,not_removed,indeed ban this asshole already wtf wc already probably crashed the economy twice
2007scape,not_removed,great assumption but no
2007scape,not_removed,why would a wc bot get membership at wc train fm get fletch and notice getting a pet before cutting alot more logs
2007scape,not_removed,what a surprise that someone has an alt account in right
2007scape,not_removed,the squirrelbadger thing
2007scape,not_removed,its a beaver because beavers cut down trees rare woodcutting pet
2007scape,not_removed,you should add the option to abstain though
2007scape,not_removed,if you want to abstain dont vote
2007scape,not_removed,possibly they are still the bis by quite a large amount i think another part of the crash was how many players were camping clues after the update which brought more ranger boots than normal into the game eventually that supply should even out and there could be a rise then but i wouldnt expect much either way
2007scape,not_removed,probably not the god dhide boots are a pretty good choice for the average slayerzulrah farmer
2007scape,not_removed,you assume theyre bots because theyre in the ranged area they could be alts they could be goldfarmers to assume makes an ass out of u and me
2007scape,not_removed,lol who plays with public chat on
2007scape,not_removed,i always have public off when i kill wyverns on my alt its one of the most toxic places on rs
2007scape,not_removed,implying its worth talking to anybody outside of a cc
2007scape,not_removed,people have public off its an alt theyd be focusing on their main and again probably have public off goldfarmer bot
2007scape,not_removed,people who arent autistic am i using that word right ive noticed this too op not a single one says a word usually im not sure why nothing is being done about them but it could be that they are alts of some try hard neckbeards
2007scape,not_removed,if you are ranging wyverns which is what op is talking about then youd be an alt therefore you wouldnt even be watching the chat
2007scape,not_removed,thats cool
2007scape,not_removed,fake
2007scape,not_removed,he still has shitty quest guides
2007scape,not_removed,i like his quest guides personally
2007scape,not_removed,even some kind of simple gathering place where you can gather something that sells for like token each would be cool
2007scape,not_removed,not really the point of last man standing also part of what made stealing creation fun was using your own stats having them boosted to near max and given all the tools would not be as fun
2007scape,not_removed,rip le ears but yeah i agree with you i would love it if everything got reset on death tbh then i could just keep playing the same account even if i die and do it all over again d
2007scape,not_removed,so youre autistic as fuck but ill try to explain this to you anyways a massive piece of code that has to reset every single variable on your account is massively inefficient and completely ridiculous to expect especially considering the fact that this would need to be updated every single time they release a new piece of content and it only gets longer and more problematic as time goes on youre a fucking moron if you think this is a reasonable expectation this is in no way sustainable even if they wrote a script to reset all the variables on your account in the event they forgot something which could absolutely happen it could potentially be catastrophic which would only cause an even greater uproar repolling is retarded because its already passed the poll how the fuck do they repoll it now with different rules if people voted yes for the current mechanics then repolling it is a slap in the face to all of those people it passed with the current mechanics you cant just repoll it with new mechanics because you feel like it new hiscores you can be on for a little bit and when you die nothing bad happens if you are playing hc for the purpose of competing on the leaderboards then you lose all of your progress up to that point then continuing to compete requires you to completely reset if you arent playing hc for the purpose of competing on the leaderboards then your point is moot youre so caught up in this idea that you need to lose something tangible in order for there to be risk youre fucking retarded when you die as an hci you lose the ability to compete on the hiscores and if you are specifically playing hc for the purpose of competition then you have lost everything why are you so aggressively stupid we want the reset feature to be added in no you want it added in the massive majority of players who voted yes on the poll clearly dont want it or dont care either way why not just play it as a regular ironman until i die because there is a big difference between just playing an ironman as anyone else would and playing a hc account competitively on the leaderboards
2007scape,not_removed,rip in pieces headphone users at the end
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think reset on death is fair because of world ddoses sadly resetting to normal ironmab is fine and the symbol symbolizes that you have not died which is nice
2007scape,not_removed,so i dont usually care for ignorance but youre a retarded combination of ignorant and rude a piece of code to reset every single variable on your account is not inefficient whatsoever the recurring spaghetti codebase issue needs to be directly addressed with a refactor if the team is at all concerned about the longevity of osrs id rather they halt all future updates and get to work on fixing the most crucial issue that has plagued this game since its inception repolling it with the suggestion for modification would only be to the detriment of a minority of players the status quo is failure lets suppose the modification passes at most of the playerbase that voted yes to the original uim poll could be annoyed peanuts repolling helps to iron out implementation issues and address concerns that might not have arisen or come to the fore when the question was only a question rather than a mandate there is redundancy in selecting normal im mode why would a player ever choose im mode when they can simply select hcim and play with an ims mentality in the case that you progress your hcim well you might decide to switch to a hcims playstyle having had no risk whatsoever since your original intention was to play as an im this opportunity would not arise if there were a significant risk selecting a hcim account why are you so aggressively shortsighted no you want it added in the massive majority of players who voted yes on the poll clearly dont want it or dont care either way then you wont mind if we poll changes ill counter your baseless remark with the idea that not all players have the time or care to evaluate every poll question to the same extent as you i looked at the idea at a glance thought cool and voted yes the redundancy of im didnt even occur to me why not just play it as a regular ironman until i die because there is a big difference between just playing an ironman as anyone else would and playing a hc account competitively on the leaderboards completely ignoring the point
2007scape,not_removed,immediate downvote from seeing that ranky pic of the vid like fucking cringeeeeeeee
2007scape,not_removed,if you want no death penalty then you should be a normal ironman hardcore ironman is supposed to be for people who are willing to accept the risks dying to disconnects is terrible but it did not stop them form implementing this mode properly in if they want to add in an ingame opt out item then i would be okay with that but hardcore ironman should carry some risk
2007scape,not_removed,i love how you respond like days late and with an alt account so you dont look like a fucking dunce on your main im not reading your shit stop hiding behind alts
2007scape,not_removed,fire is better than air meaning water is good if you have agility and not magic but you should prob have the magic to do fire so do that just noticed caps is on but idc
2007scape,not_removed,try it for an hour and then try air orbs and report back to us
2007scape,not_removed,i did this maybe months ago the runs are similar length fire water is usually better than aor by a little bit though i think at most i made
2007scape,not_removed,id rather not waste an hour which is why i am asking if anyone has experience
2007scape,not_removed,how is it wasting youre getting magic exp and
2007scape,not_removed,you could literally do one run time it and keep track of the xpgp you get in that one run and do math i know its scary to figure out the results for an hour stop being lazy
2007scape,not_removed,i think a friend said that fire orbswater orbs is faster with agility than air orbs
2007scape,not_removed,youve probably wasted more time posting this question and searching around than any difference in xph and gphr between water and air orbs for
2007scape,not_removed,because one is better than the other so he wasted however much gp and xp based on whichever is better
2007scape,not_removed,there is an entirely different feel to them since one goes through the wildy and requires quite a bit of attention and one does not he should try both imo
2007scape,not_removed,support dicks out for harambe
2007scape,not_removed,screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,pulled through gave me
2007scape,not_removed,op came through cheers
2007scape,not_removed,i was too late
2007scape,not_removed,op gave me
2007scape,not_removed,op gave me
2007scape,not_removed,got a kraken tentacle thanks alot
2007scape,not_removed,still here op
2007scape,not_removed,been out of osrs for a while months would love to catch a drop if i do i think i can be self sufficient and keep my membership up
2007scape,not_removed,thats a part of the game
2007scape,not_removed,still going lol
2007scape,not_removed,oh just read the rules here havent been on reddit much obviously my bad will remove my potential moneyitem request
2007scape,not_removed,just got here dont see ya
2007scape,not_removed,same thing tomorrow right d i missed this completely
2007scape,not_removed,merch clans
2007scape,not_removed,glad i kept mine after they crashed to like after jagex fucked about with raid armour on the polls
2007scape,not_removed,if you look at the entire quarter it looks like its slowly recovering to where it was before it dipped in august its a pretty volatile price since its traded at around and its probably more commonly used as a merch or to show off wealth than as pvm gear
2007scape,not_removed,bought thanks
2007scape,not_removed,it only works for pickpocketing
2007scape,not_removed,damn okay thanks
2007scape,not_removed,do you play on a piece of wood
2007scape,not_removed,i might give it a shot everything ive looked at seems to say its a legit client or about as trust worthy as osb aka use at your own risk edit decided to try it out so far im like that i can reposition all the interfaces and trackers on osb that was broken of the time i tried to use it
2007scape,not_removed,yeahh i already dont really trust osbuddy as is nevermind some weird party client ive only heard of twice
2007scape,not_removed,his processor is pretty low end usually you see those in chromenotebooks so probably
2007scape,not_removed,konduit hacked my dad
2007scape,not_removed,i thought the same thing but konduit is very trustworthy i have an account with in cash and items and ive been using konduit for months now my account has never been touched they update frequently and have really nice features i will never go back to osbuddy if you dont trust them just make a throwaway account and try it out konduitio
2007scape,not_removed,if you have an auth and bank pin dont worry about it
2007scape,not_removed,am i doing this right
2007scape,not_removed,is fun because i can jerk off and get mining at the same time
2007scape,not_removed,why does this bullshit even get brought up on either sub lol let it go its annoying when both ends of the community bicker like morons
2007scape,not_removed,both games have their strengths and weakness on one side i can get max in only days played on the other i can get banned for crashing emily nothing is perfect
2007scape,not_removed,this type of thing is old both versions have their strengths and weaknesses no need to bash one or the other
2007scape,not_removed,how do you even accidentally do that
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,comment about a coming shitstorm that isnt coming no one cares
2007scape,not_removed,could not resist im weak
2007scape,not_removed,lol i get it is trash xd
2007scape,not_removed,ftfy op
2007scape,not_removed,could this be le epik new meme
2007scape,not_removed,ive been chilling on for a few days doing divination on the side now i have to say the game has a nice feel to it runs alot smoother than osrs even on max settings no need to hate on either version d
2007scape,not_removed,brilliant
2007scape,not_removed,dis gon be good grabs popcorn
2007scape,not_removed,shitstorm in the comment inc im just here for the ride
2007scape,not_removed,g e t b o n d
2007scape,not_removed,do you even lift get bond
2007scape,not_removed,brand new meme right here
2007scape,not_removed,pretty much explains the sub right now
2007scape,not_removed,what is the get bond meme how did it start
2007scape,not_removed,you meme about this but i got level mining exclusively while in class because of how crazy afk mining is fishing and crafting are next on my list
2007scape,not_removed,its a joke p i play both games and this is not very offensive i feel sorry for people offended by this
2007scape,not_removed,even though i like you must admit the meme itself is dank
2007scape,not_removed,cus moron the fact he made this post proves that in all honesty
2007scape,not_removed,maybe if people took the time to look into what the games strengths are rather than spending time shitting on eachother wed be a better community as a whole both games have their strengths and their weaknesses when a new player comes theyll notice there is two versions they will also notice two communities having a dick rating contest and bickering then become put off from the game were all runescapers regardless of version were family
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy
2007scape,not_removed,everyone was asking for an update to the currency pouch to make it less clunky and just shitty in general so they updated it by putting the get bond button there nothing else
2007scape,not_removed,i still feel mining is a chore when its sub lava flow levels shooting stars helped tho
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt a joke its intentionally trying to stir shit that isnt needed
2007scape,not_removed,its a shit joke
2007scape,not_removed,i totally agree i play both
2007scape,not_removed,what are strengths recently made an osrs pure and am already getting a little bored
2007scape,not_removed,i play on the jagex client on both versions if thats what you mean
2007scape,not_removed,oh without a doubt until i reached all my exp lamps went into mining crystallize was a nice way of training but because theres no soul altar soul tunes have risen to nearly each
2007scape,not_removed,its a joke get over it or get bond
2007scape,not_removed,i found it pretty amusing
2007scape,not_removed,never argued it was a good or bad joke as humor is subjective but its pretty clearly a joke you acknowledging its a bad joke just helps prove its a joke
2007scape,not_removed,that might be because you locked yourself away from of the games content by making it a pure
2007scape,not_removed,combat is more interactive the game is very lore driven and the newer quests are phenomenal the game focuses on endgame content moreso now so xp rates and such are higher than osrs high end combat is great and makes you actually think what to do graphics is an obvious one
2007scape,not_removed,that sucks i was just wondering if you were using osb because it runs particularly horribly sometimes even on extremely good pcs
2007scape,not_removed,or get over the fact games have changed this applies to both and osrs
2007scape,not_removed,i never liked the pve in osrs i find it to be a boring massive grind im asking what makes pve worth it
2007scape,not_removed,runs smooth as hell i play league on max settings with fps but osrs runs like a wheel through mud ¯ツ¯
2007scape,not_removed,bc osrs uses your cpu and not very effectively it doesnt use your gpu at all recently though osb released a client and performance is somewhat better than the original
2007scape,not_removed,what about his comment shows he is not well aware of that this is definitely a joke whether you see it or not this seems to have really got under your skin though why is that does it actually make you upset when someone says a game you play is trash you might be a little insecure
2007scape,not_removed,a lot actually depending on how much youre willing to learn about eoc and boss mechanics that revolve around eoc youll have fun look up some bosses like vorago araxxor telos these bosses will give you an insight of how good endgame pve is on
2007scape,not_removed,just old java tech not designed to effectively use resources since they werent available back then a client overhaul would be necessary and i dont think the team has that kind of dev time
2007scape,not_removed,nothing to do with them saying the game i play is trash yes i play and yes obviously it will bother me when people shit on a game i enjoy but the constant bickering between the communities is so annoying its bad for both games new players will come and see that there are two versions of the game they will also see two communities butting heads together because they feel some sort of urge to try and outdig eachother whenever possible that is what puts players off obviously not the only thing but its definitely up there like were all still runescapers were all part of the same community the same family what use is it to argue and tear strips off eachother when both games could learn off one another
2007scape,not_removed,yeah im aware of that p its a shame really
2007scape,not_removed,aim for rune gloves early game very achievable and each quest has early skilling goals id also suggest getting avas accumulator including doing ghost ahoy
2007scape,not_removed,set small goals dont go in thinking fire cape and barrows gloves think stuff like a quest a day and base stats for instance
2007scape,not_removed,servers are shit
2007scape,not_removed,thank you i hate when people are like barb fish to str before doing any melee training and shit like that most people are going to just get scared off
2007scape,not_removed,yeah fuck that thats not fun for the averagereturning player id have quit if i did that route
2007scape,not_removed,jagex is recruiting more player moderators for osrs hopefully they pick people with different play styles ironman pvpers etc so all fronts are covered by regular players to mute them that should hopeully solve a lot of it just one note being a player moderator is not a job and they arent required to even report them whenever they see them let alone actively search for them
2007scape,not_removed,ok so we can ban them in which case the account and everything on it is dead so they just go and create a new account or we turn them into ironmen like accounts and they either trade everything away through deaths or just count it as a loss and immediately make a new account do you see there is no difference or real gain
2007scape,not_removed,how bout educate retard year olds
2007scape,not_removed,the solution is for people to not be retarded its seriously so simplistic yet unintelligent people keep falling for it
2007scape,not_removed,awh shit you done woke up the monster
2007scape,not_removed,can we ban this meme
2007scape,not_removed,questing is the best way to get into the game imo welcome back d find a clan as well
2007scape,not_removed,riding on this thread do you know any good noob friendly groups just like op i just recently returned to the lands of rs nearly everyone ingame seems too focussed on not missing out on xp
2007scape,not_removed,not for osrs specifically but there is a group i use to hang with back in the day way back pre eco pre trade limits called rs outreach they are still around i think and generally have friendly people warning they are a very pg chat
2007scape,not_removed,mithril bar mith dart tip feather mithril dart smithing bars into dart tips is basically break even for the bar and for the darts tips its slow xp per hour i think so its cheap fletching the dart tips into darts on the other hand is very fast xp basically the fastest in the game its for the ingedients for the product and you gain fletching xp thats gpxp tldr fleching xp
2007scape,not_removed,super stupid fast fletching xpfletching while doing agility
2007scape,not_removed,people fletch darts for super fast exp they lose money doing so since they make more than people use
2007scape,not_removed,how can you fletch while doing agility wtf
2007scape,not_removed,you just make darts while doing rooftop courses
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,that is crazy guess it doesnt work with arrows s
2007scape,not_removed,correct
2007scape,not_removed,require a lot of clicking or no
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,thank you wtf i needed that wut
2007scape,not_removed,this boy is out of control
2007scape,not_removed,hes a walking please bully me sign
2007scape,not_removed,didnt leafyishere make a video about this kid
2007scape,not_removed,he looks just like the guy on a pringles can
2007scape,not_removed,trance
2007scape,not_removed,yeah
2007scape,not_removed,a majority of people ive seen with rot in their name arent in rot a couple rot members dont even have rot in their name ie da grinchl g h t mazhar heavywelght etc on dmm its up to you really if they drag you into multi area or youre suspicious about it then leave they really arent much more toxic than other clansplayers they are very good at pvp and are well coordinated in fights if the members try then they can easily get in the top theyve done it before their are clans bigger than rot ac for example
2007scape,not_removed,a very very long time dont remember for sure but at least years now they are almost just kids who put rot in their name fight them by all means a rot bait wouldnt have rot in its name yes they do thats the way deadman is meant to be played the aim of deadman is to kill everyone they flame as much as any clan the clan world is a very different place flaming is normal conversation between clans they are literally some of the best pkers in the game its borderline impossible to get into rot unless youve been in the clan scene for years they are the best in every respect when it comes to pvp they have never used a cheesey strategy everything they do is done because it is the best strategy or the best use or abuse of game mechanics i will bet every gp i have that rot will win the next tourney they will not make the same mistake they made last tourney and just assume theyve killed everyone and let themselves die there were p pots all over the floor korean girl couldve easily tanked for another minutes but chose to die because they didnt think anyone else was alive also they do know how to click a tree they will all have top of course not thats a rather silly question any pk hotspot doesnt bother me theyre the best and they know it theyre cocky as fuck but so is every clan and every hybrid thats osrs pvp for you rot isnt playing this season yet anyways so dont worry about them theyre gonna get on at the very end and get stats for top then play the tourney but for the moment theyre bored with dmm and decided to sit this season out
2007scape,not_removed,forever one of the oldest clans on rs which is why they are also one of the bestsmartest theyve seen every situation all ready more than once a lot of real rot members dont even have rot in their name as others have said a lot of people adopted the name because they thought it makes people less likely to attack them is really your call trust your instincts on thst one but they definitely arent above luring lol its not suffocating its winning dmm isnt built for solo players its more than possible for a solo player to do well and win but what rot does is not whats wrong with dmm its mostly crying people thats normal for clans they are literally some of the best pkers in the game do not take their use of easy game mechanics as a weakness in a straight brid fight they more than hold their own theyve made it every time so far no it is definitely in the spirit of the game a lot of multi spots and places with the needed resources to make sure no one else gets them the normal pk spots in dmm really i dont care i dont really like them but god damn do i respect them they are one of if not the absolute most organized clan out there they may seem like they are acting like children but in their tss and chats they are actually coordinating everything thats simply why they are so good no other clan is as well organized and concise as they are
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,theyve been around since like and have dominated osrs the entire time it was out in the clan scene without vr sacrificing themselves to rot theyre left unchecked in dmm and no other clan touches their level of superiority
2007scape,not_removed,the clan is supposed to be a really picky selective so i wouldnt be surprised if some of the guys are solo as for the naming my little brother has rot in his name they own zeah or at least did during the invitationals
2007scape,not_removed,rot members are probably all very high level because they play long hrs anyone you see around your lvl with rot in their name probably isnt rot rot is very good at pvp they won every bracket in the pvp cup getting top is easy because so many ppl quit and rot members will rarely die and lose stats
2007scape,not_removed,since i believe mostly fan boys depends on your combat level and gear there is always a chance the dude have friendsclan to help him out if hes under attack regardless on name yes not all of them when you have the muscle you basically can say whatever you want and get away with it yes they are pretty good with the clicking if i remember correctly they fucked up season and several members got declined access to finals because of account sharing in season they came up with a decent team work and won the whole pvp fight yet there was a one cheesy player that won i dont think so there are clans with higher numbers than rot what makes them better is probably effective training and working as a team for gearsupplies dmm last hour tends to be a fight between clans i dont care
2007scape,not_removed,op seems kinda salty
2007scape,not_removed,i have a question for you are you mad
2007scape,not_removed,and still solo players has won both tournaments i guess rot is not that strong after all kappa
2007scape,not_removed,korean girl didnt let himself die btw all the foodpots despawned everywhere he could click from his spot
2007scape,not_removed,invitationals is the top players correct also does it seem a bit unfair if a single group dominates all forms of pvp for a solo playerwon competition
2007scape,not_removed,you mean account share and funnel money through alts
2007scape,not_removed,not at all my encounters with them include hearing dont go there it seems rot has taken control of that area seeing a skulled guy with the rot tag in his name and watching a video where a guy escapes a from a clan people are insisting was probably rot nothing really negative whatsoever outside of normal antipker sentiment its just me thinking wow thats kinda shitty but this is super biased im going to ask a group of people to get a full range of opinions
2007scape,not_removed,well both tourneys came down to a tank test not much skill needed in sitting there chomping on food whoevers lucky and didnt take much damage and waste supplies wins
2007scape,not_removed,wasnt the winner on codeine or however you spell it part of lit
2007scape,not_removed,time codeine had no loot spawns around him and korean girl did
2007scape,not_removed,any survivallike game or scenario is going to involve humans forming a group its human nature to want to be part of a groupto build relationships especially when said groupsrelationships benefit you to add to that ive heard from various streams that rot isnt playing this season although theyll probably grind out enough to get into the top by the end of the season
2007scape,not_removed,well thats jagex problem not solo players they could make so theres safespot in middle of all like area but they havent done it so far
2007scape,not_removed,i heard he was solo joined just some group in the final to keep himself safe but dont believe me im not sure i just like to make fun of rot
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but groups of are understandable i even met a group of about a dozen and i thought that was the funniest lure ive ever seen but guys roaming around in death packs with literally no equal is a little more than just slightly bullshit
2007scape,not_removed,on codeine was in lit bonesaw pks team i believe the first winner was also in a team
2007scape,not_removed,no he was in lit
2007scape,not_removed,loot piles dont despawn in order of alch value
2007scape,not_removed,well imagine youre a well off great solo pker are you going to try and fight people or are you going to join and make it
2007scape,not_removed,so what there are clans even bigger like ac with as many people
2007scape,not_removed,since when is it bonesaws pk when dead botting is the leader
2007scape,not_removed,okay i saw him pming some big streamer after winning and telling he was solo player i guess he was lying then
2007scape,not_removed,he wasnt even a rank
2007scape,not_removed,okay i saw him pming some big streamer after winning and telling he was solo player i guess he was lying then
2007scape,not_removed,i just watched the qa apparently he wasnt in lit just joined their cc for the lols mb i guess
2007scape,not_removed,they patched that months ago
2007scape,not_removed,yeah no problem i was not sure either
2007scape,not_removed,there were p pots right there korean girl said so himself and if you honestly think that enough people died on every square to despawn all the p pots then idk what to tell you
2007scape,not_removed,the only ppots that were there were noted ones look at mankedupmages pov too shortly before he dies he tries to loot ppots sharks and karambwans and all are noted and he right clicks a lot of piles with no foodpots
2007scape,not_removed,just saw this guy at the private red chin area looks like you broke his spirit for hunting blacks lol
2007scape,not_removed,this is why i bring magic defence bonus to chins and walk away from pkers while being slightly drizzled on by all the splashes
2007scape,not_removed,ustoicsrs check out his history
2007scape,not_removed,salt is the best seasoning
2007scape,not_removed,the irony of having a name like stoic and being this upset about dying
2007scape,not_removed,lmao if only he could get muted for that glad you fucked him up
2007scape,not_removed,dont go in the wild if you dont want to die
2007scape,not_removed,on the one hand i feel his pain getting pkd just trying to skill but on the other hes a racist piece of shit whiney kid
2007scape,not_removed,how dare you kill people in wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,and people say the pking community is cancer meanwhile you have skillers like this that always bitch and complain about being killed in the wilderness complete with hilarious hyperbole like telling a pker his family should be shot he made the skiller lose some pixels or crashers at every spawn just being dicks level talking shit at the ge all day and so forth
2007scape,not_removed,thats really embarrassing for that guy
2007scape,not_removed,not very stoic of him to get mad and go so far as to say racist things on your youtube
2007scape,not_removed,ive skilled in wild pvmd and got the majority of boss pets in wild never have i ever felt frustrated enough to wish death upon the family of the guy who killed me for gods sake all you do is try to minimize risk maximize survival chance plan an escape or prevent getting pkd by doing activities at certain hours of the day find a good way to get back to your activity in wild incase you do get pkd and then getting pkd just becomes part of the equation
2007scape,not_removed,what the fuck is wrong with parts of this community who believe they deserve to not die in the one area of the game where you can be attacked jesus christ
2007scape,not_removed,i dont get why so many people in this post are confused as to why people get pissed when they lose their items its not a hard concept
2007scape,not_removed,this is why you kill skillers lol
2007scape,not_removed,gratz on total mel
2007scape,not_removed,stoic in name only lmao
2007scape,not_removed,total worlds when pls
2007scape,not_removed,wow its my clan on reddit haha
2007scape,not_removed,what a disgusting filth
2007scape,not_removed,this is gold
2007scape,not_removed,how the fuck does he casually find ur yt lol
2007scape,not_removed,people who kill skillers in the wild are dicks but this guy is way too mad when he knew things like this happen
2007scape,not_removed,tilted
2007scape,not_removed,how many chins did you kill him for damn
2007scape,not_removed,owned
2007scape,not_removed,nice free scripted advertise
2007scape,not_removed,i think you tried to kill me at black chins on thursday or friday can i get a link to your youtube i wanna see if i made the video
2007scape,not_removed,ok but its on a wednesday and youre killing skillers like what are you doing
2007scape,not_removed,haha what a cock
2007scape,not_removed,delicious
2007scape,not_removed,hunting blacks uhhh
2007scape,not_removed,what gear do you use
2007scape,not_removed,lmao this is gold
2007scape,not_removed,why do you project your feelings of inadequacy onto me you fucking faggot ass bitch cunt piece of shit
2007scape,not_removed,white cooking smh
2007scape,not_removed,salt isnt a seasoning so much as it helps other flavors to better bind with the taste buds on your tongue also it is a vital requirement for us to have salt but too much obviously does bad stuff like what happened to this guy i mean look he died and is now a spoopy ghost haunting op
2007scape,not_removed,i hope he does
2007scape,not_removed,getting pkd just trying to skill i mean hes in the wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,yours is probably the best comment here to sum up this situation yeah pkers preying on skillers and pvmers stinks especially when they keep trying to entice more players to enter the wilderness in the first place but why did he have to respond like that
2007scape,not_removed,this is why i cant be arsed with hunter now got to and just kind of stopped for now i basically avoid the wilderness whenever possible though
2007scape,not_removed,while i do think you make a valid point i think its just as stupid that clueshunterrc brings you out to the wildy
2007scape,not_removed,the pking community is cancer the rest of the community is also cancerous
2007scape,not_removed,lvl skillers at blacks should always get the pk d
2007scape,not_removed,embarrassing to be outed as a nasty racist or embarrassing that he got killed
2007scape,not_removed,because by going past the wildy border you agree that its ok for people to kill you and take your items theres a big ass warning and everything but hey just like anywhere else people dont read the terms and conditions and proceed to bitch about it when they realise they dun fucked up then everyone else laughs at them
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt excuse being racist and wishing death upon someones family thats just fucked up
2007scape,not_removed,thanks friend
2007scape,not_removed,if you google zeales youtube im right there i dont hide myself or anything
2007scape,not_removed,if this is true then people who skill in skilling areas are dicks people who pvm in pvm areas are dicks where will the madness end
2007scape,not_removed,no they are not its the wilderness for a reason
2007scape,not_removed,only lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,buying haters must be willing to get featured on reddit
2007scape,not_removed,i havent uploaded recently
2007scape,not_removed,yes theres only one timezone in the world
2007scape,not_removed,this happened on monday you missed the shot pretty far lad
2007scape,not_removed,its tuesday though
2007scape,not_removed,found his friend
2007scape,not_removed,the entire design philosophy behind the notablestackable items collectable in the wilderness is based around giving you an opportunity to defend yourself against pkers or having an opportunity to escape rather than just being a victim the longer you stay the more you risk however the prospects for profit are greater than equivalent methods of training outside the wilderness youre rewarded for the extra risk you arent entitled to those spoils until youre out of the wilderness so play smart or train somewhere else if you were complaining about essence pkers or some asshole killing a person hunting black salamanders thatd be different but you just sound like a spoiled brat complaining about black chinchompa pkers
2007scape,not_removed,skilling is the easiest thing in the entire game unless youre tick manipulating go learn cerbzulrahraids or go pick flax
2007scape,not_removed,guys high risk high reward training methods shouldnt be high risk pound sand moron the entire reason why methods like black chins are absolutely incredible for both profit and experience is because of the risk to dumb it down if there were no pkers killing people with black chins they wouldnt be worth nearly as much and jagex wouldnt have set the experience rates so high youre getting an op method because youre willing to take a risk or should be willing to take a risk
2007scape,not_removed,dont go in a place that makes you accept a warning that says essentially people are allowed to kill you and take your items then read the fucking terms and conditions people
2007scape,not_removed,bro have you never heard of riskreward if they put black chins in a safe space they would crash from bots having a feeding frenzy
2007scape,not_removed,risk vs reward if the risk were removed black chins would plummet in price and so would reds as a result if it really upsets you to get pkd bring a few brews with your food and learn to switch prayers it will take a very lucky combo to kill you and even that shouldnt be possible if you constantly safe up all you need is some hides and maybe cheap tank legs and youll make it to wildy every single time even if you get tbd hobgoblins are a few steps away and pretty much are a guaranteed escape
2007scape,not_removed,yeah maybe i couldve worded that better haha
2007scape,not_removed,my familys favorite pasttime

2007scape,not_removed,probably spectral arma top rest is welfare like jester boots
2007scape,not_removed,woah there that was uhobscene heres the adulterated version for those kids out there why do you project your feelings of inadequacy onto me you fudging fruit butt wench fathead piece of shoot
2007scape,not_removed,it is a seasoning fat is what helps spread flavor without adding flavor dont believe me go eat some unsalted butter and tell me how good it tastes salt has its own flavor but it also brings out sweetness and cuts bitterness
2007scape,not_removed,he said he felt his pain not that it was acceptable to whine about beeing killed in the wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,why does it stink the whole point of putting these places in the wildly is risk vs reward i wish more people would kill these skillers just because they whine
2007scape,not_removed,jk i love you
2007scape,not_removed,nah con youre just bad cx
2007scape,not_removed,definitely its just such a lazy and arbitrary way to increase difficulty
2007scape,not_removed,real talk
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,why not both
2007scape,not_removed,ur point doesnt change anything most people would get pissed in that situation i did hunter a fair while ago all at black chins and never died cause clans didnt exist on total worlds back then hopefully they dont exist there now either but idk and i can promise you i would be pissed if i died for my chin cause i would have at a time even if id release them so at least they dont enter the economy still would miss the profits its a justifiable reason to be angry i just lost x amount of gp fuck this game people get pissed off when they lose a stake at duel arena and they knew that there is a good chance they will lose just because you accept a risk doesnt mean u should be happy with the worst outcome
2007scape,not_removed,itsjustwords
2007scape,not_removed,selling my body gp
2007scape,not_removed,a spoiled brat what are you basing that assumption on im a spoiled brat because i didnt abuse nmz and im not maxed cb and therefore unable to access part of the game id be a spoiled brat if i whined that i couldnt do it on a level not a level with reasonable cb stats
2007scape,not_removed,i think you dont know the meaning of the word easy the entire game is piss easy skilling is just incredibly boring but you have to do it if you want skillcapes dicks that run around pking black chinners just to piss people off are the cancer of the community
2007scape,not_removed,username doesnt check out
2007scape,not_removed,na judging by his use of hard r spelling the n word you are probably accurate in your original statement
2007scape,not_removed,would twisted bow work if i dont have maul
2007scape,not_removed,us colored folks use adobo and lawrys
2007scape,not_removed,but youre never just trying to skill when youre in the wilderness theres always that threat nobody should ever be surprised to get pked in the wild even if youre literally running to the mage bank naked
2007scape,not_removed,cant wait for the salt from wildy rcers
2007scape,not_removed,i think the more legitimate frustration is the fact that people can world hop on multiple accounts so quickly that youre essentially gated from content on certain days depending on who is playing a couple weeks ago i was killing elder chaos druids and even though i was risking i couldnt be there for more than minutes before the same guy hopped to my world he had two accounts for tbancients so my only option was to tp out before he could tb me maybe i was just particularly unlucky but this went on for several days in a row the same two accounts i get that its the wilderness but its still kind of shitty that one person can impact the game on every world this way
2007scape,not_removed,i would be much less against it if there wasnt a reason for skillers or pvmers to go into the wilderness in the first place but unfortunately some players keep advocating for more gphr or xphr in the wilderness for skillerspvmers so that they can be mugged by pkers for loot
2007scape,not_removed,disagree wildy should be content for players who enjoy pvp it shouldnt need to encourage people not interested in pvp to enter it abyss is fine cause its at a negligible wildy level but all wildy rejuvenation content was made simply to set up a predator and prey environment not a pvp player vs player environment none of the content encourages pvp all bosses drain too much food and require specific gear chins require u to stay for large amount of chins to be worth it compared to red chins and you will never fight back at chins because you lost food slots to box traps slots to tar and slot to chins along with risking mils worth of chins its not worth fighting back edit just so people dont ask if you are not staying at black chins for over thousands of chins just do red chins its not worth the time to get imp boxes either in the time u spent collecting imp boxes and banking ur chins u can get more xp and money at red
2007scape,not_removed,u didnt make one reasonable argument
2007scape,not_removed,how is it arbitrary it brings people to a different part of the map it fills that part of that map with content it brings interaction between the pking and skilling community it keeps the price of resources higher as there is actually a risk to the best hunter method thus allowing you to actually make decent money hunting it also really is not difficult at all to escape pkers at chins with even a tiny amount of skill antipking some of the extremely shitty kids who try is a ball also
2007scape,not_removed,just because youee not happy with the outcome doesnt mean you should tell someone you hope their family dies
2007scape,not_removed,oh of course they dont have to be happy with it however that doesnt mean they have a right to complain they definitely dont have the right to flame and insult other people over it the consequences of your decisions are yours to deal with and yours alone a pretty simple concept for most mature people to comprehend
2007scape,not_removed,probably not unless you bring your twisted bow for extra mage defence in your inventory
2007scape,not_removed,adobo adobo or adobar spanish marinade sauce or seasoning is the immersion of raw food in a stock or sauce composed variously of paprika oregano salt garlic and vinegar to preserve and enhance its flavor tried googling lawrys and all i find is lawrys® seasoned salt mccormick seasoned salt was created in to season prime ribs of beef served at the worldfamous lawrys® the prime rib restaurant in beverly hills ca lawrys so basically what im getting is that its salt
2007scape,not_removed,what does being surprised have to do with anything when i skill in the wild i have no intentions of pvping considering theyd be equipped to kill me and im equipped to skill pointless
2007scape,not_removed,it keeps the price of chins high because theres actual risk for the best xp and money it brings life to the wilderness it brings the pking and skilling community together now lets hear your argument beyond i think its stupid
2007scape,not_removed,also just to follow up on this i believe the addition of the eternal amulet of glory is a perfect way to implement pvp x pve you can charge your ammys normally no problem however you take an extra risk to potentially get an uncommon reward in this example pve isnt locked out of content arbitrarily but as a result both get something for their troubles
2007scape,not_removed,i get that its a good part of the gamerelatively counterable for some people but its definitely arbitrary based on random choice or personal whim it relies on someone somewhere being there to guard the system in place for the same reason its lazy game design because of the feastfamine natureif tons of people are there the risk is extremely high if no one is there the risk is nonexistent for example killing jad rewards fire cape all you have to do is kill the boss in an instanced environment however difficult that may be person to person some would claim a wilderness pet is more valuable despite the killing of the boss being substantially easier albeit in a pvp zone take away the pvp and the wildy pet loses all value
2007scape,not_removed,you dont have to shit on your game to fill a pvp area with pve content please
2007scape,not_removed,he didnt say that you should read what he said
2007scape,not_removed,he didnt kill their family he said some words to let out his anger people need to stop taking online insults so seriously especially when they know the other person is infuriated at the time they say those words
2007scape,not_removed,badia complete seasoning goya adobo all purpose seasoning and lawrys seasoned salt
2007scape,not_removed,because killing skillers in the wild is profitable and youre a walking cashpile maybe
2007scape,not_removed,you can catch chins and be equipped to fight back
2007scape,not_removed,this was shambly but great and why im currently getting my hunter up on my pure d
2007scape,not_removed,keep in mind at black chins the only people who have ever attacked me maxed in serp helm ely sod and some cheap other stuff are people in absolute max gear with a massive clan the times when worlds were full at chins and i had to use a normal world the guys in mystic just logged off if i wanted to fight back i wouldnt be risking chins worth mils that provide benefit in the fight same for callisto drops like nests provide a ton additional risk which doesnt help u in pvp its so much more advantageous to wear actual gear for pking instead of fighting at a disadvantage if u want to get attacked just bring gear and walk around the wildy ull find someone
2007scape,not_removed,it keeps the price of chins high because theres actual risk for the best xp and money the price of chins are high enough already not to mention that one death at black chins renders that method completely pointless as then you would have been better off doing reds the risk vs reward is not worth it and this is why you see top streamers and anyone with a brain do red chins edit i guess black chins is impossible to do as a streamer it brings life to the wilderness there are other means of going about this if this is what your goal is skewering skillingwhich is too slow to begin with to bring life to the wilderness is stupid it brings the pking and skilling community together i dunno what ur trying to say here and i dont want to know
2007scape,not_removed,you can also hunt red chins without risk and train hunter that way if thats your argument however risking is better experience and money its not like youre locked out of the skill if you dont like the wildy
2007scape,not_removed,yes i know what arbitrary means thats why i gave you a list of reasons of why its not just random choice like how wildy pets lose a ton of value not being in pvp chins would also lose a ton of value people can also hop worlds so you never actually know if no one is around theres always people around and chins are usually fairly stable so the system seems to work what does jad have to do with this whatsoever
2007scape,not_removed,a doesnt mean you should tell someone you hope their family dies b he didnt say that you should read what he said op hope ur mom dies wot
2007scape,not_removed,reading is difficult am i right
2007scape,not_removed,correct salt
2007scape,not_removed,except if you kill someone getting chins dont they get released on death
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but of the time your going to lose if you chinning like half your inventory is going to be taken up by traps chins and your teleport gearrunestabsstamina pots your down to like slots you can fill with foodpots compared to the or so the other person has even if your running a specrushing pvp set your still going to lose basically any time you dont get super lucky
2007scape,not_removed,i am glad someone appreciates my unorganised thoughts
2007scape,not_removed,prob better things to protect if ur actually trying to fight back and not just survive i know a lot of people just dont attack you when ur maxed but it happens sometimes theyre free enough loot that its worth skulling aswell if that doesnt make u risk like a sotd and shit when ur in basically rags i definitely understand your frustration tho people are pussies but we worst case scenario u still get to shit talk them there is no real reason not to bring actual gear for pking at chins tho nobodys forcing u to bring sotd ely serp and rags i dont get that argument its not really much different for calli either tho ur a bit more limited veracs is actually pretty solid antipk gear as it is even dhides with cbow to ags is i personally would bank more often at chins than you would because black chins is more efficient than red chins regardless of how often i bank for me since i can stay at red chins for like a solid mins before shutting off my computer but even then there will be plenty of times where uve caught like chins and can fight back or even more if u can identify lures and shit cuz its not the hardest place to escape in the end this additional risk is shit u gained for free because u werent just walking around the wildy waiting to get attacked ur actually getting gp and xp so its not the biggest deal same for calli sure the drops are extra risk but if u were just at edge or walking around deep wild u wouldnt have gotten those items in the first place and if ur still that fucking worried at calli u can trade ur drops over to an alt cuz theres no level at callisto safespot pvp is supposed to be about fun why are we even stressing about this extra risk if ur really that tight on cash theres nothing stopping you from banking more you dont need to do everything the most efficient way
2007scape,not_removed,ok i can do this too i disagree i think the price of chins should be higher or at least remain at their current level since theyre such fast range xp i disagree i think this is a good means and skilling is fast enough as is i think just having all the skills and methods be incredibly fast with zero risk is stupid and uh not sure what you dont understand it puts pkers and skillers in the same place when people are in close proximity to one another one might say that they aretogether
2007scape,not_removed,nobody forces anyone to go skill in the wilderness people make the decision to go into an area they know they know they can get pked in dont wanna get pked dont go into the wilderness its that simple
2007scape,not_removed,this is true its an exception i dont support bitching about getting killed at bchins as in the op post just general pve x pvp content mistmatch
2007scape,not_removed,bosses wildily heh different circumstances
2007scape,not_removed,i am referring to the reply yuki made to hence why my comment was a reply to what yuki said
2007scape,not_removed,not black chins in the wildy
2007scape,not_removed,dont most people release them right before they die also nice name a lightswitch
2007scape,not_removed,u seem to have the wrong idea u like pvp most people who support the comment i posted are not interested in pvp u want to be pking u dont care about ur xp rates u look forward to being attacked i dont want to be attacked u are not being the prey u want to fight players but the majority of players which the wildy rejuvenation attracted were not players interested in pvp its a massive minority who want to fight back and would chose hunting black chins just to pk and not for potential better xp rates
2007scape,not_removed,i disagree i think the price of chins should be higher or at least remain at their current level since theyre such fast range xp sure youre entitled to your opinion as i am to mine i disagree i think this is a good means and skilling is fast enough as is i think just having all the skills and methods be incredibly fast with zero risk is stupid i say risk vs reward is not worth itwhich invalidates pve content being in pvp zones and thats why people who dont want to waste xpgold do red chins and you reply with i disagree i think this is good okay also incredibly fast with zero risk is incredibly fast when you need millions of xp for diariesclues and uh not sure what you dont understand it puts pkers and skillers in the same place when people are in close proximity to one another one might say that they aretogether you still didnt state your point why is there an incentive to bring the communities together so that you produce more of this
2007scape,not_removed,you can do pvm outside of the wilderness you can catch red chins etc every single update in the wilderness works the way eternal glory does except the pvm doesnt really reward you much compared to safe alternatives
2007scape,not_removed,nice work with the wildily haha i suppose a big chunk of sticking stuff out there came from people asking for the wildy to be rejuvenated forever ago since there wasnt much of a reason to go besides pking and kbd i like the risk for the better xp but i also kind of appreciated when you actually risked gear when the dcs and stuff were less common now itd be a little infuriating at bosses and difficult monsters that had solid drops so maybe different strokes for different folks nice having an actual discussion on this subreddit that hasnt moved into insults and name calling haha
2007scape,not_removed,its a justifiable reason to be angry in reference to dying in wild yukiyuri that doesnt justify telling someone you hope their family dies which is what the skiller who got killed by op said
2007scape,not_removed,ah ty
2007scape,not_removed,not if youre good
2007scape,not_removed,the wilderness is for people who want to pvp any skilling updates inside the wilderness are catered towards people who want to pvp whether that be antipking opportunities or just prey a lot of people do love the predatorprey type of pvp and someone needs to be the prey if you want to do this content you accept that because there are so many bosses and so many training methods that are perfectly fine where you cant get pked bringing skillers into the wilderness meaning theres prey for the people who enjoy that kind of pvp is in no way a bad thing they are both there voluntarily black chins are the most efficient way for max combat players to train hunter assuming normal circumstances as in ur not a streamer or we the only drawback is you get to be the plaything of pkers sometimes thats the conditions you accept because while you benefit from this update its not actually trying to cater to you its catering to the predators you dont have the right to complain about it if youre lower cb depending on ur build etc it might not be as efficient but then you just go to red chins if you dont like pvp and actually get better xp in the long run the wilderness is the pvpers playground anyone who isnt willing to fight back is only allowed to be there as long as pkers let them it draws a lot of shitty skiller pkers into the game which encourages other pkers to hunt for those and it also allows for people to bring antipk while skillingpvming and creates fights that way these updates were great for the wilderness in general and i think theyre the best way to create deep wild hotspots its been a winning formula ever since things like green dragons and kbd were released certain skillers not liking it when theyre being attacked doesnt make it a bad update just means those skillers need to reevaluate whether they should be participating in that content or doing an alternative instead skillers get better xp rates pkers get prey it is mutually beneficial i dont understand how you cant see that
2007scape,not_removed,looking back at my comments i hope i didnt come off as too aggressive i just wanted to state my pov but youre definitely right the discussion wo bashing so damn invigorating have a good one man
2007scape,not_removed,he said that it was justifiable to be angry not that what he said was justifiable as was arguing people are allowed to be annoyed when they lose items not saying what this specific person said was ok
2007scape,not_removed,killing chin hunters good choose one
2007scape,not_removed,as i stated in the original comment updates should be made to encourage pkers into the wildy not to encourage players who have no interest in pvp into the wildy buts thats clearly not who they were made to attract many pkers have some skills still at level encourage pkers to enter the wildy not skillers
2007scape,not_removed,nah not offended at all and didnt think you were coming off as aggressive hope i didnt either definitely a reasonable argument all around and glad you dont support the shit like in ops picture take it easy dude
2007scape,not_removed,i mustve misunderstood or misread then
2007scape,not_removed,salty someone killed you at chins skillers carry more risk than pkers these days stay mad
2007scape,not_removed,imagine dying to someone at chins you have to basically try with how bad they are
2007scape,not_removed,all it takes is a gmaul spec
2007scape,not_removed,cant miss every shot you take i love it when people use the wrong prayer and i noodle a spec and they start acting cocky bro you got lucky that rng was on your side

2007scape,not_removed,the fact this exist makes me wonder how messy their code actually is
2007scape,not_removed,group based bosses are all pretty much exclusively ranged or melee the only bosses that makes use of magic at the moment is barrows and zulrah both solocontent its usefull at dagannoth kings but ultimately its far easier to do dks with meleerange and magic than meleerange and magic generally if your combat stats outside of prayer that can remain at for piety are youre good to group up with people in godwars or dagannoth kings it wont be super quick kills but itll do just fine for some deployment fun if your connection can manage consider tanking bandoszammy gwd defense levels arent a huge deal as you have so much defense bonus from armor that even being def vs isnt going to change much likewise zammy gwd only has a magic attack that hits through defences minion damage so it matters even less there volunteering to tank will make it easier to find a group as everyone prefers getting a shot at a petthe ease of attacking and low melee stats means youre less of a burden to a group as a tank as you dont dps nearly as much when tanking anyway
2007scape,not_removed,getting lured in at least you can almost say that it happened last year
2007scape,not_removed,gp split
2007scape,not_removed,dont fuck with big kuntry
2007scape,not_removed,do u play dmm people get lured all the time lol this isnt the same as retarded luring on the normal game
2007scape,not_removed,ive been active every season and tournament i also play regularly whenever me and the team i was with tried luring someone into multi i thought it was far too obvious i feel like people know it might be a lure but still risk it for the biscuit which is pretty stupid if theyre risking far more
2007scape,not_removed,i mean worth we made them run afterwards they have teamed up with almost all the clans dmm and they still need to lure because numbers do not equal levels

2007scape,not_removed,classic xd
2007scape,not_removed,i wouldnt mage them since their defense is so high if you wanna give it a shot let me know because i wanna see how that goes
2007scape,not_removed,im sure they have high mage since they use that style to attack so its probably not a great option
2007scape,not_removed,take a rune pouch with you with vulnerability runes and trident should be decent after that if u have good mage gear and an imbued heart
2007scape,not_removed,im going to test it later will post results
2007scape,not_removed,not a bad idea ill try this later and let you know how it goes
2007scape,not_removed,ive started taking vulnerability instead of venge at zulrah and it shreds bro
2007scape,not_removed,it works kinda not the best method but it works
2007scape,not_removed,i dont understand your logic saying no degrading of pouches rc is op it literally takes seconds extra every laps or so through the abyss and a bit longer with npc contact at worst its annoying but nothing you think about often i think it is a very reasonable perk for achieving rc i have atm
2007scape,not_removed,non degrading pouches literally saves like seconds a few times an hour when using the abyss its not op in the slightest while still being a nice reward for the slowest in the game but when the average player has a runecrafting level of around who has absolutely no understanding of how negligible this is at were going to be stuck with a back mounted tiara forever
2007scape,not_removed,i tweeted ash yesterday and he said that they wouldnt be opposed to just adding another perk alongside the tiara effect pouches not degrading at all seems the most fitting for people with
2007scape,not_removed,not degrading is a bit op but is they degraded say slower that could be reasonable
2007scape,not_removed,all tiaras is nice if there is another perk on it it needs to be in addition to id like to see it simply degrade slower
2007scape,not_removed,working as tiaras is good for max players doing lavas since they can still get the full graceful effect i liked the idea of it being able to repair pouches a few times a day not op but still useful
2007scape,not_removed,why not make the rc cape hold up to pure ess
2007scape,not_removed,i honestly dont see why making pouches non degradable is so op it only saves abyss rcers seconds every runs and lunar npc contact about seconds
2007scape,not_removed,completely agree i just dont see the use of them constantly degrading and as someone with rc i find the perk lack luster compared to others
2007scape,not_removed,exactly it barely saves any time its more of a qol thing if anything plus the rc cape is one of the hardest if not the hardest cape to get so its perk should be somewhat relevant
2007scape,not_removed,ba services
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont wanna be a leech if you pay a cc its and youre expected to be a leech
2007scape,not_removed,it was always hard remembering which cycle i was on when i was learning zulrah made it into a clickable pdf hope it helps adamwesticlz
2007scape,not_removed,oh look a butthurt fan lul
2007scape,not_removed,in most democratic elections around the world you cannot say here is this thing of value vote for me in the us it is up to year in prison us code § obviously this isnt a governmental election lol but it definitely shouldnt be allowed
2007scape,not_removed,why are you copy pasting one of my posts that has no relevance i never said he had to be disqualified but it is unfair to the others who let their stream speak for itself and dont try to influence votes sorry you dont understand
2007scape,not_removed,i rarely watch boaty but at least boaty is real and doesnt put on some act plus if i were a butthurt boaty fan why would i be mad he is winning the poll
2007scape,not_removed,some sort of action by maybe taking his name off the list
2007scape,not_removed,everyone else has the option to influence the votes they might just choose not to their choice also you didnt say he had to be disqualified you said they should take his name off the list what else does that mean lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,boaty is far from real lol
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt put on some act damn i thought he was a streamer
2007scape,not_removed,id take you seriously if you didnt actually hate ices guts as seen in your recent posts
2007scape,not_removed,he speaks likes hes talking in twitch chat and it triggers me
2007scape,not_removed,streamers confirmed actors
2007scape,not_removed,same from me i cant login to any jagex websites i heard that many players from around my location cannot connect either so it must be a regional failure where are you located at
2007scape,not_removed,im in qc too i dont know for you but it started to work again got me at around last night
2007scape,not_removed,canada qc my friend also have the same problem but of my other friend dont and we are all located in the same city
2007scape,not_removed,got the same thing and another person had it start working at this time so i assume its on jagex part or our isp
2007scape,not_removed,i think its jagex its not the first time that happens
2007scape,not_removed,just get everyone to pretend like its like its our normal subreddit watch as they get mad then some of our people get banned from that sub finally they start doing the same thing to us but it never stops and the subreddits forever switch sorryalittlehigh
2007scape,not_removed,im down
2007scape,not_removed,i can tell good idea just need to post some of those til insert rune here looks like dorito and then upvote them all to front page
2007scape,not_removed,everything looks fine as it is i highly recommend pot up sons guide basic technique makes it really easy also jad will spawn wherever the level spawns on wave you can go in and out until you eventually get a southeastsouth spawn which allows you to easily trap jad before spawning and allows you to drag all the healers back to safety trying to juggle the healers and prayers is why most people die on jad so honestly its just best to do that until youre used to it
2007scape,not_removed,veracs skirt karils crossbow for the healers and more brews if its your first time good luck my friend dont feel bad even if you fail times
2007scape,not_removed,the most important thing is to keep your focus on jad and switch properly wear defence if you plan to tank the healers prayer is enough even if you dont flick if anything train ranged levels first or your attempts will be slow there are vids aimed towards pures in how to lure jad so the healers spawn behind him and u dont have to tank or kill them just hit them once
2007scape,not_removed,your setup is fine id actually take a guthix book rather than an obby shield just use spawn prediction as described here piece of cake with it just avoid taking damage from multiple damage types if you can if you have to be under attack from both a ranger and a mager pray mage and kill the ranger immediately try standing next to where it spawns
2007scape,not_removed,died to jad watched his guide and beat him next try highly recommend that guide
2007scape,not_removed,i have a v skirt banked i might switch to that
2007scape,not_removed,explorers ring for prayer bonus if you cant get an archers ring
2007scape,not_removed,you need to give the three things to the delivery boys again the whole point of that section is to sneak them past the guard
2007scape,not_removed,alright ill give it a try thanks
2007scape,not_removed,jerkoff every xp
2007scape,not_removed,sometimes you just need to take a break i could never make a pure account because training only certain skills to specific levels would bore me to no end do something you want to do for a while even if its not playing osrs personally i play in cycles play alot get burnt out then go do something else im currently playing the new tales game which works out because of the servers having all these issues at the moment
2007scape,not_removed,porn
2007scape,not_removed,honestly man the grind is like not even worthit in the end just do a good bit right until you get super bored then go do something you enjoy doing for example i did agility yesterday because i am going for graceful was hell and i still need more marks i like to break stuff into sets like today i will be going for more marks cause so if i stay at that rate yeah itll take days for full graceful but i wont kms doing it but everybody is different man
2007scape,not_removed,my advice is to take a break from that particular project and do something you enjoy an hour of construction then an hour of slayer for example but if you want to become more engaged you can play an alt as well so i run accounts at a time sometimes and it keeps me slightly more interested however this can also burn you out faster if youre not careful about it so youll end up taking a break from the game sooner but on the bright side cannonball wc fishing alts can be quite productive
2007scape,not_removed,find good long series on netflix i like bones its seasons should get you at least two
2007scape,not_removed,i like to read books on my kindle while chopping yews its especially convenient how osbuddy notifies you when your tree falls
2007scape,not_removed,teach yourself a new skill
2007scape,not_removed,oh damn that made me chuckle
2007scape,not_removed,i bet mod moodie gets in trouble for that one
2007scape,not_removed,bid
2007scape,not_removed,inspect element right
2007scape,not_removed,should of gone for
2007scape,not_removed,or that was never the real image and you edited the source code like a pleb
2007scape,not_removed,actually it was a porn stream they ended up playing porn instead of phishing
2007scape,not_removed,make her tank bandos for you
2007scape,not_removed,i wish my girl still played her acc
2007scape,not_removed,why not do a duo ironman account theyd be normal accounts where youre only allowed to interact with each other also dawww
2007scape,not_removed,buying gf
2007scape,not_removed,shes basically an ironwoman too but in case she ever gets really serious about it then she can learn to trade and stuff she can also buy bonds at ge and use on me and herself when we start making cash
2007scape,not_removed,its a totally different account if you will you will not get any progress towards your oldschool account on that world you will only start a new account but with the same file
2007scape,not_removed,more like final exams
2007scape,not_removed,more like nice
2007scape,not_removed,plus it stacks with rapid heal providing hit points per minute
2007scape,not_removed,who the hell takes hours for a firecape
2007scape,not_removed,just pay someone to do it if you cant
2007scape,not_removed,so its a dosage of saradomins brew every minutes
2007scape,not_removed,how to get hacked
2007scape,not_removed,this guy gets it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i bet you could
2007scape,not_removed,nah
2007scape,not_removed,it does
2007scape,not_removed,not rlly people who get paid to do it would rather keep their rep intact than hack a kid who probably already transferred all his wealth before hand
2007scape,not_removed,lots of trusted fire cape sellers out there keep being delusional
2007scape,not_removed,yeah then come back and complain on reddit when your account gets hacked and blame it on the recovery system
2007scape,not_removed,a comment almost as edgy as your user name enjoy middle school next year
2007scape,not_removed,so stupid lmao the people who do f capes do it as a job why would they ruin their rep
2007scape,not_removed,for usd
2007scape,not_removed,source its the same price as buying a torso for most parts usually around which is nothing to people who dont care for fight caves and want cape
2007scape,not_removed,paying for torso
2007scape,not_removed,what should i pay and where just curious
2007scape,not_removed,a ba leech is mil
2007scape,not_removed,ba services or leech ba for torso services ive heard good things about playerauctions firecape guys and sythe too
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but most of that is over lmao
2007scape,not_removed,dead meme is dead
2007scape,not_removed,considering this meme gets posted on many subreddits many times a day i wouldnt say its dead
2007scape,not_removed,considering this meme gets posted on many subreddits many times a day yes that is why its dead
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think you know what qualifies a meme as dead there are over dead memes this one is still kicking
2007scape,not_removed,just because your mum gets fucked over times doesnt mean shes not dead
2007scape,not_removed,wasnt this posted yesterday
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,waterfall quest for that sweet start off combat xp if i remember correctly you can do it right off the bat starting off
2007scape,not_removed,go for barrow gloves
2007scape,not_removed,id say barrows gloves are a very good first goal quest cape if youre into that is also an awesome goal theres a few guides on efficient quest orders wouldnt be hard to find other than that just do whatever you enjoy slayer being a good option p
2007scape,not_removed,just go for barrows gloves then all med diaries youre account should be pretty good at that point from there you can work on slayer skilling questing or work towards bossing
2007scape,not_removed,it should be a permanent break
2007scape,not_removed,would recommend witchs house first to avoid getting one hit in glarials dungeon
2007scape,not_removed,nice to know that hasnt changed waterfall quest is still recommended for beginnings in
2007scape,not_removed,it will if the game is good enough
2007scape,not_removed,how do level beat that boss
2007scape,not_removed,really i was contemplating starting but never bothered even though a few skills transferred over from years ago
2007scape,not_removed,he could train to magic and safespot using fire strike
2007scape,not_removed,you should if you want anyways what skills should i get started on first other than combat obviously item wise i guess rushing full rune green dhide is good enough for now
2007scape,not_removed,easy early levels p
2007scape,not_removed,i did ardy knights with wines as food just trap him in the a certain shop and you can just click while watching a movie
2007scape,not_removed,you can boost it with a spicy stew but id just get and boost with summer sqirk juice
2007scape,not_removed,i personally did pyramid plunder
2007scape,not_removed,i did pyramid plunder for diaries worth it imo wasnt bad at all
2007scape,not_removed,pyramid plunder or ardy knights are the best under blackjacking
2007scape,not_removed,whats the xph like
2007scape,not_removed,thats what i was thinking seems the least worst how long do you reckon it would take me
2007scape,not_removed,youre on the internet with all the information youll ever need lol look up the xp hr and calculate
2007scape,not_removed,theres already way more than subscribers xd edit but yes i know what you meant
2007scape,not_removed,i mean the sub says were on at the moment
2007scape,not_removed,ah sounded like you meant osrs subscribers
2007scape,not_removed,was impressed until i saw the south american village that will be getting a share
2007scape,not_removed,i just called that mate youre calling an ely on every kill it isnt difficult
2007scape,not_removed,if you call it every kill does it really count
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt know was in your clan
2007scape,not_removed,congrats on that way split
2007scape,not_removed,wilderness guardians
2007scape,not_removed,what client is that that shows him when to pot up
2007scape,not_removed,that one annoying ass friend who calls ely every kill then wont stfu when it finally drops
2007scape,not_removed,stupid hacker
2007scape,not_removed,wg
2007scape,not_removed,im sure if you say its gonna drop an ely after ever kill sooner or later youll call it
2007scape,not_removed,dank af
2007scape,not_removed,is
2007scape,not_removed,everyone got a free arcane
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy pro
2007scape,not_removed,had around kills and it was the first time that was said
2007scape,not_removed,way split is
2007scape,not_removed,yo
2007scape,not_removed,it was way each i aint complaining d
2007scape,not_removed,cool great post super interesting content here is a better link anyway cause yours is a piece of shit
2007scape,not_removed,theres already the xerics talisman that does all of that
2007scape,not_removed,as if we dont have enough teleports yet
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,yeah
2007scape,not_removed,xerics talisman provides specific locations but by no means cover all of the houses lore wise this could be something that the previous king used to be able to keep the peace by being able to send soldiers quickly to the far ends of kourend or since it is a diplomatic and mercantile hub to move trade goods and important persons
2007scape,not_removed,wake me up when the dcs end
2007scape,not_removed,i was hoping the ddossers would get tired of it after three days but its been days i guess this is how it is now vpn or dc
2007scape,not_removed,somebody should do a blair witchesque video series on not being able to play where he just gets more and more desperate with each passing day
2007scape,not_removed,from mmks post there seems to be very little clear communication between jagex and their hosting provider so it may well not even be ddos related for all we know they probably have no clue
2007scape,not_removed,i thought this was going to be another dc meme at first
2007scape,not_removed,i believe that the new tournament will take the seasonal stats and transfer them into the tournament that could change how the tournament is done for you
2007scape,not_removed,i know like lava drags is taken al kharid falador and tavern can be really dangerous but i kinda found it surprising that ive seen a couple different streamers go to greens drags and i figured that would be a death sentence but they didnt have a problem
2007scape,not_removed,no freezes early and ge short cut makes it easy also cemetary just makes it a pain in the ass to kill someone for nothing special
2007scape,not_removed,oh ok thanks
2007scape,not_removed,need an ultrawide my man the edges of the screens are in the way
2007scape,not_removed,i feel like it would annoy me having my character so close to where the screens meet
2007scape,not_removed,its funny because before a qol update you had to refill it yourself xd
2007scape,not_removed,make it so you never need to refill it either with a quest or just add it or if you must lock it behind diary
2007scape,not_removed,support unless it adds extra unneeded ticks
2007scape,not_removed,that would be super nice
2007scape,not_removed,basically copy the craft runes code no way to get around that
2007scape,not_removed,a million times yes
2007scape,not_removed,this is a bad idea it would be a super easy and op way to kill someone in a pvp world
2007scape,not_removed,youd actually think to refill it though not assume it would refill itself
2007scape,not_removed,phial of eternal ecto juice
2007scape,not_removed,maybe achievement diaries i hate putting everything to them but this seems like a fitting reward id say medium
2007scape,not_removed,lol i sat there for a minute thinking is this really that important to people then i realized you were joking so l o mother fuckin l
2007scape,not_removed,not necessarily regardless of how you unlock it or if its a patch if they just made it so you use the ectophial spawn at the ectofuntus with a full vial and it displayed the message you refill your ectophial at the ectofuntus without doing the animation theres no delay for stacked damage and you dont need to worry about not refilling
2007scape,not_removed,chance by refilling at ectofunctus
2007scape,not_removed,eternophial
2007scape,not_removed,so basically lynx titan for minutes
2007scape,not_removed,would be interesting to see the sudden drop due to the ahkers quitting
2007scape,not_removed,it would be more interesting during the start race to max and like then vestfold heyjase randalacious competing until lynx comes
2007scape,not_removed,wintertodt would be a insane spike up on both this graphs
2007scape,not_removed,it would be for top players only not the total amount of exptotal levels gained accross all accounts although thats possible too
2007scape,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvhzpwsxjpg
2007scape,not_removed,and
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt realize they dropped blue scribbled dicks
2007scape,not_removed,this has been around for years the item changes but the principal is the same they are using the messed up ge value protection that everyone voted yes to
2007scape,not_removed,throwback thursday okay technically wednesday to the days of noted torag hammers
2007scape,not_removed,old trick used to be by alch price so people would lose items like dragon battleaxes back in to get whips off players
2007scape,not_removed,rite of passage this is one of the oldest tricks in the book in general if something seems too good to be true it probably is
2007scape,not_removed,new this scam is one of the oldest bro
2007scape,not_removed,literally just happened to me lost a whip to time to do fucking green dragon runs all over again
2007scape,not_removed,it seems you have to get better at running back to town or not falling for this trick
2007scape,not_removed,back in the day it use to be torag hammers
2007scape,not_removed,youre just an idiot
2007scape,not_removed,yep beforehand it was alch prices that were stable but the people got what they wanted in future op should use too good to be true instincts to determine whether picking up stuff in the wildy or not edit someone tried doing this to my ironman laughs were had
2007scape,not_removed,oh dont get me wrong im definitely a degenerate memer
2007scape,not_removed,how much do you need for your whip ill pay for your lesson learned
2007scape,not_removed,lucky duck
2007scape,not_removed,congrats bud
2007scape,not_removed,you dont have to type up an entire paragraph of nonsense just to say you want reimbursement we all do the fluff is unnecessary
2007scape,not_removed,didnt ask
2007scape,not_removed,cya soon
2007scape,not_removed,this shit has been going on for years and jagex has again and again failed to invest adequately into personnel and equipment
2007scape,not_removed,k
2007scape,not_removed,yeah right man cya soon
2007scape,not_removed,bye
2007scape,not_removed,grats bro
2007scape,not_removed,whats the blacked out item in inv
2007scape,not_removed,if youve never had a green stack you should probably just pay for membership with irl money that will add up
2007scape,not_removed,and to think people assume everyone has the gold for full bandos at level
2007scape,not_removed,can we get a cx in the chat
2007scape,not_removed,may not be anything to most people but it felt pretty amazing with all the odds stacked against me
2007scape,not_removed,grats man u keeping or selling
2007scape,not_removed,gratzs
2007scape,not_removed,good man
2007scape,not_removed,i kind of had the same situation i had barely enough for a bond if i sold my items then i got ranger boots in medium clues
2007scape,not_removed,gz on zammy cloak
2007scape,not_removed,welp mems is expiring anyway just give them to me
2007scape,not_removed,never had a green cash stack in ices chat makes sense
2007scape,not_removed,how have you not had cash in over lol literally takes under
2007scape,not_removed,people that say this never had yadda yadda in years of playing are really overexaggerating things if you wanted it would take a weeks work on a casual play time to get to
2007scape,not_removed,you must not know how to make money then years and not even cash lol
2007scape,not_removed,its really not hard to make money you just have to be willing to afk skills afking cannonballs is like per hour only smithing requirement
2007scape,not_removed,cyan
2007scape,not_removed,congrats still never managed to get myself a pair of rangers from a clue if youre struggling with making money for a bond you should try while training skills
2007scape,not_removed,can see run energy hacking your battery
2007scape,not_removed,you do realize is lol stop eating mcdonalds and buy gold
2007scape,not_removed,nice crazy luck dude harambe works in mysterious ways
2007scape,not_removed,never had green cash stack in ur life wtf u been doing
2007scape,not_removed,you have to be doing something wrong to have never had a green cash stack when theres stuff like zulrah and wyverns
2007scape,not_removed,no green cash in years must never played maybe played weeks in that years hahaha
2007scape,not_removed,how undeserving
2007scape,not_removed,its his cash stack
2007scape,not_removed,its my cash stack from what ive seen its bragging to put it in but its a little over haha didnt wanna look sketchy just trying to post this the right way
2007scape,not_removed,right
2007scape,not_removed,its bond you can see how large area he covered
2007scape,not_removed,if you live in a first world country and are able to work then its not ever worth buying a bond in game unless your rich friend gave you his shit if you have hours to friend for a bond you can spend hours on finding a job
2007scape,not_removed,if you do basic flipping along the way and a bit of slayerits not that hard edit lol am i being downvoted for giving basic advice
2007scape,not_removed,i got mine on my ironman on medium in that exact spot
2007scape,not_removed,selling never had the armor or anything to be able to do high level activities haha
2007scape,not_removed,who the fuck are u lmfao a horsemac sub
2007scape,not_removed,yea ices cc has its moments thanks man
2007scape,not_removed,casual
2007scape,not_removed,purple army obviously
2007scape,not_removed,oh i agree i never said i was trying super hard usually i never invest heavy hours into this a day i just am a casual player
2007scape,not_removed,or do a few hours of runecrafting can easily set aside hours of every two weeks to runecraft and pay for your bond
2007scape,not_removed,no its green
2007scape,not_removed,hed be way better off spending it on items at that level
2007scape,not_removed,yea i play on and off never dedicate large chunks of time and just play for fun the grind makes me lose interest fast my stats and my skill would fall short on zulrah haha
2007scape,not_removed,thanks kid thats all the info i needed to hack your mothers home security system goodluck
2007scape,not_removed,people black things out as a joke usually its not funny but its just what this sub does
2007scape,not_removed,rip
2007scape,not_removed,hours for a bond lmao even on a brand new acc you can get a bond in less than if you have a decently trained acc you can do it in less than and at max less than
2007scape,not_removed,its so easy just do slayer flip then buy gold on gold sites
2007scape,not_removed,i started flipping days ago but before that i did none im level and slayer my whole account has been made by training slayer and i can still only afford bandos chest but then i would have to have no cash stack for flipping so not worth
2007scape,not_removed,no lol
2007scape,not_removed,yes casual using any of the many high gp earning methods is hrs or less time days in a week thats a little over an hour a day
2007scape,not_removed,yeah a day is pretty casual ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° i mean we dont go lynx tit way of grinding
2007scape,not_removed,played an hour a day only on weekends can confirm it took me weeks and days but not as little as a week
2007scape,not_removed,i have been runecrafting after work now for or hours im starting to grind harder currently at level
2007scape,not_removed,i usually spend the first two days of my membership afking something to pay off my bond then i can do whatever after that
2007scape,not_removed,dont worry some people on the sub cant imagine a life without starting up osrs from the minute they wake up for exp
2007scape,not_removed,too late kid already hacked his router
2007scape,not_removed,hes dead moose meat
2007scape,not_removed,rip i just put fsocietydat via a rootkit into your server
2007scape,not_removed,you say its a joke but now everyone knows his run energy prayer hp and cashstack his days are numbered maybe with run hed have a small chance
2007scape,not_removed,explain
2007scape,not_removed,its easier if you just buy a maxed account with all that stuff i do it all the time but jagexs security is so bad that i get hacked constantly
2007scape,not_removed,you need a hour week to make or less with any of the many gp methods
2007scape,not_removed,i suggest doing lunar diplomacy and running astrals natures are a bit better profit per hour so if you enjoy natures then do those but astrals are the most relaxing form of runecrafting you can getbesides zeah you teleport to moonclan island bank run down to altar craft repeat its a bit more efficient to bank using rings of dueling then teleport to moonclan but i enjoy just the one teleport per run i make about per hour and im far from efficient i think currently its upwards of if youre efficiently running
2007scape,not_removed,google is all over his ip address
2007scape,not_removed,you can make more than
2007scape,not_removed,buying accounts is risky because the original owner has more power to recover it than you do and you may just be working for them as you play
2007scape,not_removed,incoming i got hacked post when the original owner recovers it
2007scape,not_removed,thanks had never tried lunar diplomacy but looks like an interesting quest i have all the requirements for it might do that
2007scape,not_removed,in on a level account good luck
2007scape,not_removed,it was a joke i thought you were joking about the buy gold from gold sites
2007scape,not_removed,you real dense homie
2007scape,not_removed,its one of my favorite quests great content unlocked and the quests itself is really well made
2007scape,not_removed,i only play ironman but its not uncommon i see people with all asking basic questions
2007scape,not_removed,same for me
2007scape,not_removed,sorry was at work when i commented on thisnot much time
2007scape,not_removed,hey whats your discord name so i can add you
2007scape,not_removed,join milk reborn cc
2007scape,not_removed,im looking for a permanent raid duo msg me if youre interested
2007scape,not_removed,fsdvasdad
2007scape,not_removed,great so i can just make a bunch of ironmen and transfer battlestaves over to my main or make a good iron man and drop noncontested dks drops over to my mainect too many issues
2007scape,not_removed,you chose to limit yourself
2007scape,not_removed,how about you kill yourself
2007scape,not_removed,the game your looking for is called minecraft® specifically survival mode
2007scape,not_removed,i would enjoy the game more if the limits were not receiving assistance from other players instead of not receiving assistance and being hindered by other players
2007scape,not_removed,flair checks out pure cancer
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt to flaunt any rng or anything i was just grinding to wyverns and wanted to share with others who might be curious to see what the money is like also this included or so hard clues edit this also isnt every loot from every kill i just scooped the best drops from each task and banked once finished
2007scape,not_removed,im doing a slayer tab as well from im at now and the price is
2007scape,not_removed,mine is better
2007scape,not_removed,proof of the area and yes same freaking thing happened to me i am done with dmm for awhile
2007scape,not_removed,gg
2007scape,not_removed,to be honest duncan has to have made fucking bank by now lmao
2007scape,not_removed,hes killed at least people
2007scape,not_removed,this has been going on for almost a week now yet it is not fixxed this is surely something that should have never passed qa
2007scape,not_removed,holy crap i found a post on the forums that stated this bug at june why doesnt anyone look at them quick code
2007scape,not_removed,i laughed so hard at the part where this noob reported for bug abuse
2007scape,not_removed,you guys didnt know about this shit oldest trick in dmm
2007scape,not_removed,i have played to kill and die alot but that is just lame i worked hard to get magpie implings to find power amulets and dragon daggers to what die because of the shitty mapping and the pj system allowing them to attack me without damage and safe areas not allowing you to attack back
2007scape,not_removed,lol so you quit after dying in deadman mode thats pretty much the point of the game anyway so ragequit dont fit to play with the consequences
2007scape,not_removed,i was able to kill his mage account just have an alt attack his main before he can start stacking hits on his smurf
2007scape,not_removed,dont play dmm but i have a few friends who do thanks for this
2007scape,not_removed,it is bug abuse that patch is clearly intended to be safe youre within varrock castle walls even the west path yes that should be dangerous but this spot makes no sense players of dmm i urge you if youre playing this game mode realise it all doesnt actually matter youre probably not going to win the the whole fun of dmm is the challenge and risk associated with going pkingtraining anywhere in runescape everyone who does anything like mules any use of alts boxing to pk people looking at you guy north of varrock west bank misses the point of deadmanmode this game mode is fun because its challenging and risky cheating it destroys the whole point and now its just a slightly quicker grind than rs in my opinion either just leave and do private servers or play osrs because youre not cut out for it tldr when youre playing dmm just sit and think is what im doing going against the fundamental nature of dmm if so just stop because its actually pointless the season resets you just grind again
2007scape,not_removed,yea haha you sure told us xd been doing this shit since day le memes
2007scape,not_removed,then not report about the place do you use it with the new pjing trick to get kills on people
2007scape,not_removed,dying in dmm and dying due a bug when in a safezone are very different things you mouthbreather
2007scape,not_removed,its not bug abuse it was a non safe area that he pked in which jagex just changed its dmm nowhere is safe get over it
2007scape,not_removed,i see no cheating just clever use of game mechanics
2007scape,not_removed,the consequence is the same if you quit based on a death why play deadman mode anyway
2007scape,not_removed,but it was a bug if it wasnt then jagex wouldnt have fixed it and duncan was abusing it therefore bug abuse
2007scape,not_removed,because theres a difference to losing your progress due to an informed risk you took and getting beaten and losing hours of time due to a bullshit bug how do you not understand this
2007scape,not_removed,no it was a non safe zone area that many people died in and cried about and since it was in the middle of a safe zone jagex changed it thats no bug hes playing the gamemode not his fault people are unaware of whats safe and what isnt not to mention he has only a few blocks to even kill someone in if you managed to die in that small area you prob had no food which was again not his problem
2007scape,not_removed,outcome is the same but sure be salty and quit
2007scape,not_removed,it is not intended to be a nonsafe zone
2007scape,not_removed,youre literally too stupid to argue with take your pseudo elitism back to your basement
2007scape,not_removed,funnily enough i have not even played deadman mode before and neiter am i doing it right now only watched streamers playing it and formed my opinion from that
2007scape,not_removed,reminds me of those people who used to stand by varrock fountain in world back in the day
2007scape,not_removed,hey baby

2007scape,not_removed,im level and havent done a souls bane rip
2007scape,not_removed,thats an excellent quest from someone who hates quests honestly do it its pretty quick and is probably the best quest imo
2007scape,not_removed,suggestion stop saying square when its not just square dont sound so mad its not your viewers fault
2007scape,not_removed,i am mad i died to that already
2007scape,not_removed,just saw someone die to this this is complete garbage can we got some info from a jmod
2007scape,not_removed,i noticed it was not a square as i recorded it i made that video and uploaded it in like minutes to put on reddit seems like an oversight in my fav game moe thanks for the constructive criticism though
2007scape,not_removed,why cant he be mad this is the third time round for dmm and jagex still leave stupid shit like this in the mode
2007scape,not_removed,we cant they are offline for the past few days and old school forums has uptight cunts not jmods or pmods that dont want to spread its awareness
2007scape,not_removed,why downvote wasnt being sarcastic lol
2007scape,not_removed,depends what are your goals you can still start late and play casual get into top and grind last weekfinals what id like to see in future though are slight changes to whom you can fight it would be great to divide casuals from tryhards for example everyone starts out as noobs and you are able to attack only levels above and below your combat level similar to pvp worlds it could also be a more complex algorithm that takes into account your combat stats now noobs can stay relatively safe and progress in dmm without being worried about some level running by and killing them at chaos druids thus killing the future of dmm while they still have to watch out for pkers at their closer levels maybe there could be a feature that lets you expand range whom you can attack by levels so it becomes in order to pk someone lower level than you youd have to take a risk being killed by higher levels eventually players will level up and this margin will become less noticable since everyone will be high levels what this system does is prevent people from abusing first weekdays for massive grind and killing casual players people who prefer to put high effort into dmm can still be ahead of others and acquire better gearsupplies earlier in order for this system to work properly there should be hundreds of players playing the game at all times throughout the season otherwise there wont be many players to pk if the casual player with this system in place can work his way up i believe dmm wouldnt die out as fast or at all
2007scape,not_removed,not everybody can get ahead thats just not how it works
2007scape,not_removed,can seasonly dmm be made into monthly as the game dies out too quick and is only fun first weeks is there any way to limit hours played per day so casuals or full time jobschool people can play too what the fuck i mean ignoring the fact the devs have specifically made deadman for a challenging punishing hardcore version of runescape experience you basically want to implement a system that would be even worse for casuals clans that nolife bad for casuals good for clans clans that nolife with some kind of arbitary number time limit on their accounts playtime per day along with yours means that while you have to be commited to other responsibilities they can never sleep and rotate groups to ensure the game is locked out in an even more routine fashion like what the fuck kind of solution would be to softlock player time be mechanically for the game and in general for any game to grow what a joke
2007scape,not_removed,bh definitely needs some updates because its pretty much become a rag fest a lot of best in slot gear is untradable fire cape void torso defenders so you can retrieve it on death for no fee people have account builds built around risking as little as possible for the biggest possible advantage for example prayer ballistaobbyags pures where you can use worth of gear and risk plus food most people dont even risk emblems which is the main point of bounty hunter pvp in my opinion these are all the things that need to be changed in bounty hunter untradables should be broken or lost on death you should only be able to receive targets skulled emblem boosting should be fixed somehow target vs target loot should only show to the killer to get rid of looters double rushing needs to be fixed you should only be able to receive targets if you have an emblem
2007scape,not_removed,i hope when we do get pvp updates it isnt limited to just edgebh pking though that certainly does need updates deep wildy single and multi pking has various problems such as raggingno gain from untradeables
2007scape,not_removed,im a no skull pker and id like to be able to skip targets as well i risk anywhere from not much but still more than most skulled pkers to and im tired of getting targets who have like risk or less skulls are not the issue the lack of risk is
2007scape,not_removed,i love it when unskulled ags pures say voiders dont risk when they dont even risk their black chaps
2007scape,not_removed,jagex doesnt care about bh or pvp in general back when the top bh players used to stream a lot they complained a ton about how terrible bh mechanics were they went to reddit several times and made long ass threads discussing possible solutions and got attention from jmods
2007scape,not_removed,when i find a nonskuller i tap them and go remove my skull in clan wars then i attack them from far away and kite while they try to catch me sometimes i even snare them the plan is to drain them of all their food no intentions of ragging
2007scape,not_removed,i really hope they dont change the deep wildy thing the wilderness is more than the levels north of edgy
2007scape,not_removed,what if untradeables were claimed by that edgeville skull giver while leaving coins as loot for the killer you would have hour to reclaim your untradeables from him for a price greater than the amount of coins they leave behind to the killer acting as a small gold sink example you kill a guy with a torso and get coins he talks to the skull giver and pays to get it back
2007scape,not_removed,solution no protect item in bounty hunter worlds and crossing the wilderness ditch skulls you on arrival meaning you cannot just go to clan warsduel arena and unskull after skulling
2007scape,not_removed,this annoys me as wel my idea to fix this is that you can only upgrade tiers if you skull i dont know if that would have a major impact but at least it would help a bit
2007scape,not_removed,lol u must be mental bh could be tons of fun but this kills it for me along with getting looters as targets and people in deep wildy how could you say that getting a free tier upgrade kills it for you lmao
2007scape,not_removed,let me guess youre an obby mauler
2007scape,not_removed,yeah cant stand people making builds where they literally plan on never skulling like att with under pray
2007scape,not_removed,only recieve targets if you have an emblem so if you dont have one youd have to pvm for it or what
2007scape,not_removed,im not entirely sure how bh works but i thought you needed to kill a target to get an emblem how will you get a target to get an emblem if you dont have an emblem
2007scape,not_removed,you should only be able to receive targets if you have an emblem not possible since you always loose the emblem if you die however they could create a great money sink by adding the tier emblem to the bounty store for certain amount of gp it would also encourage players to actually try to get higher tiers instead of mass selling the tier
2007scape,not_removed,you should only be able to receive targets if you have an emblem thats the dumbest shit ive heard in a while
2007scape,not_removed,you should only be able to receive targets skulled you should only be able to receive targets if you have an emblem these two should be combined you should only be able to receive targets if you are skulled or have an emblem it doesnt stop itemers but they now have to carry an emblem risk each time adding a skip option op suggested along with this would be a good concession to what we currently have the problems your original two points bring up are youd be adding a paywall to pvp having no other way to get a target besides having an emblem would make it very hard for newer players to play especially since the price of them would likely rise dont forget that emblems arent drop rate youd also be further congesting the wilderness bosses on with ironmen trying to get an emblem to even play bh forcing people to only get skulled targets would also mean you couldnt hunt after pvmers or some such its not as common as playing bh at edge but its still a thing that would be killed if you couldnt get unskulled targets
2007scape,not_removed,a lot of best in slot gear is untradable fire cape void torso defenders so you can retrieve it on death for no fee imo the unskullers that use shit like bandos are worse
2007scape,not_removed,i risk more than most people my level at the end of a fight heck if you count the emblem and im a lvl voider the only people my lvl who risk more sometimes are zerks dont fight raggers that simple if they ever made my void break or be lost on death id turn into a rusher and never pk unless rushing and im sure a lot others would too people would just get skulls then unskull to loophole it emblem boosting is only a problem for botters who are like lvl and just farming each other which get banned defeats the point of wilderness if your loot is protected they cant fix double rushing just pay attention its very easy to avoid them and if they ever tried to fix it people would just splashrag targets just cause they can splashing on a friend and target cant attack defeats the purpose of emblems chance of dropping from pking might as well sell them to players
2007scape,not_removed,its really unfair to the people who skull though you have the advantage of keeping good items on death so you should be risking more
2007scape,not_removed,exploit where they forget there are ways into the wild other than the ditch
2007scape,not_removed,the majority of non skullers i have killed dont even have emblems on them so i think that getting a target should require an emblem in your inventory as well
2007scape,not_removed,just relog it takes seconds i rarely run into a nonskuller and when i do i just stand and wait for them to attack while not responding to them
2007scape,not_removed,well if youre an ironman yes otherwise you can buy one off of someone
2007scape,not_removed,explain the whole point of bounty hunter is that you receive and upgrade emblems to exchange for points and rewards dont you think there is a problem when half of your targets dont risk an emblem
2007scape,not_removed,they could fix double rushing easily by making it so that if your target attacked you when you were in combat with another player the first hit dealt by them would be a
2007scape,not_removed,notice i said untradables and not just void that includes fire cape torso fighter hat and defenders the average zerker risks more than an average voider unless theyre using slayer helm and rune gloves which is pretty much just rag gear with untradables being broken on death remember that the people you fight who have untradables will have more risk too if they were lost on death zerkers would have to switch to rune platebody berserkerrune helm and probably ardougne cloak and voiders could switch to dhide non skulling accounts probably wouldnt go to the effort of losing their skull every fight and most would get prayer even if people did something could be done to prevent that in bounty hunter worlds emblem boosting isnt just a problem with bots but also there are a lot of pkers how boost their higher tier emblems to and also with iron men of whom buyboost kills
2007scape,not_removed,thing is many of us do risk more
2007scape,not_removed,its difficult to relog when you get so many deep wildy and non skull targets at times my zerker is combat and every other target is either in deep wildy or an ags pure who doesnt skull ive even been assigned voiders who have blowpipe and ballista or dark bow and dont skull sometimes i even get or deep wildy targets in a row if you ignore non skullers they usually just spec and tele
2007scape,not_removed,how do you think people get emblems if not target kills your reasoning is so awful
2007scape,not_removed,would be used to abuse people currently already in a fight especially streamers as if someone wanted to would just hit the streamer right before a special attack would hit or they wouldve died like die low hp but with that system make them extremely unlikely to die as itll be abused
2007scape,not_removed,even though some risk more there are a lot of non skullers who pretend they risk ive encountered so many ags pures who expect me to skull as a zerker when i risk around and they say they have a good emblem but of the time they have a or no emblem and risk in total about its totally unfair how an ags pure can be prayer and use regen brace ags berserker ring and amulet of torture to increase their max hit to more than a prayer ags pure at the same strength level while keeping their combat lower
2007scape,not_removed,i mean werent you just complaining about people who skull risking less than you though personally i dont fight someone who doesnt skull the couple extra that they might most of the time dont risk isnt worth the items that they have to give them an advantage over someone who skulls
2007scape,not_removed,wtf is your luck and finding people to fight of my targets skull and so do i
2007scape,not_removed,well you can buy them off of other players or if youre an ironman you can kill wildy bosses for one i honestly dont see the problem with having to purchase an emblem from a player to get a target
2007scape,not_removed,well just straight up make it so that a target cannot pj or make it so you cant fight someone else if you have a target already
2007scape,not_removed,im aware they should simply display if opponents are risking a emblem or not though and what tier
2007scape,not_removed,yes as lack of risk is the problem
2007scape,not_removed,it depends on your combat bracket is full of non skulling ags pures
2007scape,not_removed,and where did the player you bought it from get it if you remove target can drop emblem then you are forcing all emblems to come from boss monsters
2007scape,not_removed,might as well play the new game mode at a pop since emblems would go up if you need one to even get a target
2007scape,not_removed,then back to original issue of someone target locking by having a friend splash them or the second part removing the point of wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,voider and i meet mostly skulled agsers with low risk they dont use untradables
2007scape,not_removed,make it so you cannot engage in combat with any player except for your target if your target is within wilderness levels of you combat wont be interrupted if your target comes closer and you cannot get a target while in combat sounds simple enough
2007scape,not_removed,it would still make wilderness basically safe in nonmulti zones if you just got targets over and over until you got a friend then went to do something like hunt chins or fishminewc
2007scape,not_removed,then make it so if you dont engage in combat with your target within minutes then you lose them as a target
2007scape,not_removed,would then make it pointless to hunt targets which is the point of bounty hunter
2007scape,not_removed,implying anyone actually does that
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure thats intentional

2007scape,not_removed,chance to have had at least mole pet by that kill count
2007scape,not_removed,if anyone knows of somebody with higher kc of a boss without pet please let me know yes i know its me again posting my mole kc sorry
2007scape,not_removed,in your post months ago mod roq said he wanted to see you break looks like you made it
2007scape,not_removed,are you sure you talked to the farmer to unlock the pet drop
2007scape,not_removed,wasnt there an streamer that had a ridiculous amount of kills without pet ended up being a bug that kept him from getting it lol
2007scape,not_removed,i know kacy had a ridiculous kraken kc but i believe his was in the
2007scape,not_removed,if its any consolation i will never not upvote you
2007scape,not_removed,not a pet but also bad rng httpiimgurcomguwtblupng
2007scape,not_removed,id love it if you got the mole pet totally forgot about it and its in the pet insurance place lul
2007scape,not_removed,i think the mole deserves a small buff maybe just add more rune and addy items no need to go crazy buffing it but just something
2007scape,not_removed,i would really like to see some common sense logic used for pet drops where your chance of getting the pet starts lower than average and scales up based on your kc ex for a pet youd start at and scale up to not actual numbers just an example seeing people like op who is times over the drop rate is just painful
2007scape,not_removed,how much have you made from the mole trying to get the pet can we see your loot tab if you still have it
2007scape,not_removed,well atleast youve made over
2007scape,not_removed,i kind of feel bad that i got mine on kc
2007scape,not_removed,ouch man i finally got my baby mole yesterday at i really do hope you get yours soon
2007scape,not_removed,got my mole pet on at a time when i didnt even know old school had pets lol
2007scape,not_removed,i bet youre stoked for boss hiscores
2007scape,not_removed,now thats dedication rip pet threshold system
2007scape,not_removed,ii feel like they should just give it to you at this point just one day you log in and its there following you this is really sucky
2007scape,not_removed,what has been your estimated earnings from this
2007scape,not_removed,im currently trying to get the giant mole pet myself and you have me a bit worried with that kc good luck
2007scape,not_removed,damn dude in two months since youve posted this youve gotten over moles kills i left a comment about how bored i got doing mole in months ive gotten mole kills youre my new idol
2007scape,not_removed,what if he got it but decided to lose it for reddit karma
2007scape,not_removed,you should bring alchs for them platebodies helps you run further

2007scape,not_removed,how do we know you dont have the pet killing the giant mole could just be your favorite pass time
2007scape,not_removed,runescape players dont know how to get that pussy wet
2007scape,not_removed,at this point i am thinking you were doing giant mole drunk or something and it is for ages already in your house lol
2007scape,not_removed,you should make a guide for mole
2007scape,not_removed,can we get a poll to just give him the pet
2007scape,not_removed,the kandarin headgear does not have to be worn to have the light source effect

2007scape,not_removed,can someone explain to me how to do the math for being dry at a certain kill count
2007scape,not_removed,what are you talking about its chance you either get it or you dont smh
2007scape,not_removed,i thought it rolls for every kill that doesnt necessarily mean hes got a chance to have received one the drop rate is still regardless of kc
2007scape,not_removed,i got mine at gotta love this little monkfishpancake im sure youll get it eventually
2007scape,not_removed,i feel for you
2007scape,not_removed,you can do it buddy i believe in you
2007scape,not_removed,highest id seen was duo armadyl iirc it took him total dk kills for his first pet then he got past kills without the and stopped i think youre the driest in terms of kcdrop rate though
2007scape,not_removed,kacy went around this amount dry for dark core
2007scape,not_removed,whats the loot tab made so far
2007scape,not_removed,guy in my cc went dry on kraken pet
2007scape,not_removed,its iron aloha and dwh all over again
2007scape,not_removed,yeah he wanted me to break kacys record which is what im showing in this post kacy got core pet on kinda really hoping i get the pet sooner rather than later now
2007scape,not_removed,yes and they just gave him the pet when they realized it was bugged
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,makes me feel bad about getting it in my first kills just sits in the bank anyway same with smoke devil pet
2007scape,not_removed,its fine as it is with noted hidesclaws from the diary and the newly introduced second respawn timer this boss is a piece of cake for fairly decent money
2007scape,not_removed,i would rather see mole getting unique drop that is worth getting and it should have something like drop rate
2007scape,not_removed,the amount of time hes spent doing mole is roughly hunter xp doing black chins
2007scape,not_removed,if anything the pvm boss counter stop counting at when it just starts saying lots so that would probably be a reasonable amount to add the dilution
2007scape,not_removed,i dont see how this logic makes any sense the point of the skilling pet chance increase is that people already had mill or close to it when the skilling pets came out they are people who should have already had the pet had it always existed also there is the fact that you no longer get xp after mill so there is no reason to keep training the skill the correct comparison to bosses would be if after a certain kill count you could no longer get any drops besides the pet skilling pets are very different from boss pets
2007scape,not_removed,hes drop rate currently which is equivalent to xp if you factor in boost pretty sure all skilling pets are under xp for the drop rate meaning that if you started from scratch the likely hood of utilising the boost is negligible the main reason for it was for people who were already or close to it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah or just make it so a pet isnt straight up rng and make it guaranteed after x amount of kills its ridiculous that noobs with jad kill have the pet when people with kills dont
2007scape,not_removed,i will post the full drop tab when i get the pet collecting mole skinclaws from the start and started tracking the rest of the items after about kc i can tell you that recently the grand exchange price was about but prices are all over the place lately with seed prices and brew prices so im not sure how accurate that is i will definitely post the final tabprice check on reddit though
2007scape,not_removed,i rarely use reddit if i did that it would be for the twitter likes im pretty sure jagex can check that though cant they
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i used to not do it because i use lunars for farm runs but with the new altars in poh theres really no excuse for me now lol
2007scape,not_removed,zezima your main
2007scape,not_removed,check his kc again
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,not knowing about mcdonalds rng in kid
2007scape,not_removed,is the chance of not getting a pet for one kill
2007scape,not_removed,binomial random variable equation
2007scape,not_removed,never
2007scape,not_removed,infinity
2007scape,not_removed,the odds of not getting a pet on any given kill a raised to the power of your kill count b like this ab
2007scape,not_removed,lmao nice one d
2007scape,not_removed,that is correct but he managed to land in the pool times now which he had a chance of doing this doesnt mean that his next attempts have a better chance
2007scape,not_removed,well youre just a bad person
2007scape,not_removed,yeah his was something id thought about and i think the highest kc he had on one specific dag king without pet was about unless hes had more kills since he sold the tab
2007scape,not_removed,this mole kc is higher thats why he made the post
2007scape,not_removed,how tf does he have slayer xp
2007scape,not_removed,whats the plan after mole pet
2007scape,not_removed,hey man at least nests are up in price
2007scape,not_removed,why
2007scape,not_removed,oh ok ty
2007scape,not_removed,considering all you need is a light source and protect from melee while being arguably the closest to any bank mithril drops are fine i agree
2007scape,not_removed,so a pet
2007scape,not_removed,the drop rate at mole vs the drop rate at hunter
2007scape,not_removed,the prices have to crash first like when dks rings crashed in they buffed them i think either they made them or made the bosses higher defhp
2007scape,not_removed,i dont agree with guaranteed drops but i do think that someone over the drop rate should have a better chance than someone with kc
2007scape,not_removed,how long has it taken you to get this many kc
2007scape,not_removed,oh god do you plan on exchanging all claws and skins for nest or just selling them
2007scape,not_removed,oh thought it was
2007scape,not_removed,lul
2007scape,not_removed,lim chance of getting pet→ kc→∞
2007scape,not_removed,whats the highest itll reach then
2007scape,not_removed,my mistake i didnt account for total kill count
2007scape,not_removed,nah he quit pet hunting after he sold the tab decided it was a waste of his life and he just wanted to play for fun play a lot less he was getting unlucky pets kept being added to the game so it was a never ending goal
2007scape,not_removed,also mole is and core is
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,will he get mole pet before aus servers the race is on
2007scape,not_removed,pet is and pet is not really worth getting is just nice bonus
2007scape,not_removed,ah idk why i didnt think in those terms
2007scape,not_removed,ive pretty much been doing only mole for the past year or so or just under hours in game i dont get to play too often with workgf taking up a lot of my time lately there are a few exceptions to this where ive tried out new updates or completed the clues ive got etc
2007scape,not_removed,going to be exchanging all for nests
2007scape,not_removed,fix
2007scape,not_removed,itll get closer to as the kc goes up but never reach it
2007scape,not_removed,is this a joke or what
2007scape,not_removed,smart choice and exactly how i feel about pet hunting
2007scape,not_removed,i think he can easily win that race haha
2007scape,not_removed,tbf i was going with your train of thought
2007scape,not_removed,wow you have a lot of patience never could do something like that myself good luck with getting your pet soon though hopefully before
2007scape,not_removed,i fucking hate that stupid fucking sign passed the course with had to do with a terrible teacher who nearly got fired next class had a new teacher move along
2007scape,not_removed,thanks man hope so d
2007scape,not_removed,have u heard the word of our lord and savior nonprincipal ultrafilter
2007scape,not_removed,wot
2007scape,not_removed,ur my fav
2007scape,not_removed,what is this a future update
2007scape,not_removed,hype
2007scape,not_removed,hype
2007scape,not_removed,something osbuddy is working on
2007scape,not_removed,really how long until its released and do you know if it will be pro version or not
2007scape,not_removed,no idea on release but i assume itll be a pro feature idk tho
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,httpstwittercomrsbmatt progress on interfaces so far not as easy as i thought it would be but it isnt necessarily hard more pi this message was created by a bot
2007scape,not_removed,that is kind of gay tbh
2007scape,not_removed,what about pure fights in i know a good bit of pures who would do these kind of risk fights
2007scape,not_removed,i go to concert
2007scape,not_removed,some people actually do get banned for saying very egregious things this is pretty tame in comparison to what warrants a ban also cant accuse players of wrongdoingwitch hunt on this sub
2007scape,not_removed,this level said that after a drop party ended and he didnt get anything also kept on ranting and i just added him on ignore list terrible example of a high level for the rest of the community his rsn is lord
2007scape,not_removed,ive seen like worse than this
2007scape,not_removed,whats the issue with this just add him to ignore list if your going to get upset with what people say online
2007scape,not_removed,why does it even matter if ppl swear lol
2007scape,not_removed,are you implying theres actual player acknowledgement outside of pvp fak off lol its the nets if you cant handle some nasty words plzz leave
2007scape,not_removed,nobody cares if somebody swears they care when people start telling other people that they hope their family dies a painful death
2007scape,not_removed,why would you care
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont understand why thats offensive i wouldnt be able to explain it to you
2007scape,not_removed,its just some random person on the internet not like it has any actual consequences
2007scape,not_removed,my first master clue i had to get agility did that next step was the blood rune one dropped that shit so fast
2007scape,not_removed,prayer is the reason why lms is dead pots are distributed way too unevenly and alongside flicking and what not it ruined the gameplay many people suggested removing protectionssmite during beta but it still stayed also its totally unfair to die to someone after spending all your supples killing a guy with better armour than you you dont even get time to loot and sell loot to buy armour from the chestsmachines even with auto retaliate off the screen closes and it becomes too difficult to do anything
2007scape,not_removed,not to mention the oneway safespot performs
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,exp still no pet
2007scape,not_removed,took me a minute
2007scape,not_removed,jesus christ dude were are the spoilers my mom walked in when i had that open now im im trouble thanks a lot

2007scape,not_removed,people who know how to write a title
2007scape,not_removed,harry flopper and the prisoner of azkaban
2007scape,not_removed,okay i should have been more specific conjunctions and prepositions are not capitalized in a title
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure whats more cringe the virgin acting like he has a girlfriend or op posting his own joke to reddit
2007scape,not_removed,theres also the third type that just talks about how much weed he smokes daily
2007scape,not_removed,damn i was sure it was another lick a pussy suck a dick joke
2007scape,not_removed,im the latter o feelsbadman gun
2007scape,not_removed,hey man i thought it was funny cut me some slack
2007scape,not_removed,oh boy i wonder how this one ends
2007scape,not_removed,arent you that guy that botted got banned and is now butt hurt
2007scape,not_removed,autoclicker
2007scape,not_removed,you botted
2007scape,not_removed,contact jagex mods through twitter most posts are ignored
2007scape,not_removed,try posting when its not late at night over there
2007scape,not_removed,autoclicking
2007scape,not_removed,popcorn popcorn get your popcorn here
2007scape,not_removed,they might have detected a macro
2007scape,not_removed,this time youre the only troll i will address if i actually botted why would i care so much about one account that only had progress in one skill why not just make another one most people who bot dont care if they lose an account the ones that do most likely because they botted on their main which is stupid and reckles i would wager that anyone that was innocently playing and then lost and account for no reason that they were putting time and effort into would be as upset as i have been and still am i regret lashing out so extremely in the past week but all you get on the reddit for this community is accusations and zero help at this point i just want to truly know what jagex could have detected as a macro on my computer when i did not and have never bot thats all now i dont want to disclose my rsn on here so i understand not being able to believe me but still why would any botter care about an account with little progress so far to the extent i have i really dont like the idea of having worked on that account so hard and just losing it for no reason that pisses me off especially when i am paying for this game jagex do not have any path or outlet for innocent players who get accidentally banned this is a problem with their customer service its really bad
2007scape,not_removed,thanks i have im still trying to work things out because they said that they detected macros i was not botting so im curious as to what could have been on my computer that would have had them detect macros
2007scape,not_removed,burn in hell little fag
2007scape,not_removed,except pretty much everyone whos posted here about being banned has either botted used an autoclicker and thought it wasnt cheating or got hacked by a botter and tried to trick jagex staff into unbanning their account nothing against you but im pretty its going to end with jagex staff saying you used an autoclicker to train and you making a lengthy post about how that shouldnt be considered breaking the rules
2007scape,not_removed,well my default position is that you likely did something which you should know was wrong but it is perhaps possible that you were using something that youve always used is in the background and it some how triggered something or that they flat out wrongfully banned you
2007scape,not_removed,i never advocated that it shouldnt be against the rules i do believe it should be against the rules i never auto clicked nor said i did honestly most people in this subreddit are constantly putting words in my mouth
2007scape,not_removed,i can confirm they falt out wrongfully banned me i was only playing on osb nothing else no real world gold no macro no nothing else just logged in and played rs what i did recognize was there was one day i was afk wcing on the account that someone was complaining how theres always a ton of bots something i agree with and i assume he was saying this because of my skilling pure which is lvl of course although i responded and talked with that individual i can imagine he reported me still because he was already behaving in an immaturetrolly manner i like most player simply opened the game up listen to a music playlist off youtube and thats it i have never botted never would and never will i dont know what they detected as a macro on my computer at the time keeping in mind i was logged into another account at the same time and it being my main thankfully was not banned
2007scape,not_removed,no ones putting words in your mouth im telling you why youre met with so much skepticism other than matk banning anyone who hates on emily jagex supports been pretty accurate on their bans you may be the that tripped a false positive but no ones gonna bet on the when anecdotal evidence on this board says otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,sure of course it factually makes sense to not trust me and thats fine i just really want to know what jagex detected as a macro on my computer when i did not have a macro or bot whatsoever i contacted them on twitter but they stopped responding and they dont let me contact through the reddit of course i wish they had a legitimate form of contact for situations like this this is ridiculous
2007scape,not_removed,and you making a lengthy post about how that shouldnt be considered breaking the rules that is putting words in my mouth i have never complained that botting is not allowed i personally always think it should be banned loandbehold there are many actual bots allowed to roam yet my innocent account not so much ive played since rsc and there have always been a fucking problem with bots you predicted i would make a lengthy post about how it shouldnt be considered breaking the rules that is putting words in my mouth you and everyone else are just assuming im guilty thank you for nothing
2007scape,not_removed,use the link in the sidebar please smileys will be updated in a few hours though you arent currently required to have one to talk
2007scape,not_removed,because the main cc is cancer
2007scape,not_removed,theres multiple ccs reddit the main one with no chat restrictions reddit which is smiley and the cc which im not even sure still exists
2007scape,not_removed,i dont even take part in the main cc i dont know what youre talking about reddit is not the cc youre thinking of but thanks for weighing in
2007scape,not_removed,ive tried deleting the thread times it wont go away also ive already used the link
2007scape,not_removed,the main cc is where we want the undesirables so they arent shitting up other ccs its a service for the rest of the community edit your username is familiar to me
2007scape,not_removed,chat is dead everyone who frequented it moved to another cc so we could rid the trash since it never had any ranks online
2007scape,not_removed,i used to frequent back in the days before there was a new cc recently rejoined rs and now its gone to shit how am i supposed to get into the new cc
2007scape,not_removed,we have a request form on the sidebar of the sub i do remember you now with the reddit chat zoidberg forgot about the reddit chat and its only really moderated when myself or very rarely another mod is on
2007scape,not_removed,this push for rs to become an esport is like where they pushed for rs to become mashing keyboards its basically jagex trying to crack into a niche where it has no place of being is rs going to compete with lol dota csgo graphically fuck no this game is like fucking tick lmfao if you think so then youre deluded do people play rs specifically to compete with others fuck no the whole appeal of rs is the simplicity where you just need a mouse and could do whatever the fuck you want with no class restrictions at whatever pace you want now they are shoving this esports cancer down everyones throats
2007scape,not_removed,fix multi everywhere
2007scape,not_removed,it should just be multi anyways singles is just a pj fest and the guy who waits out of combat with full food longest wins
2007scape,not_removed,i believe that most people dont want any buyable pets
2007scape,not_removed,or a mobile pie
2007scape,not_removed,or a girls scout cookie trolley

2007scape,not_removed,yes higher the hatchet the more quickly youll receive logs
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know if theres a difference between bronze steel but when i upgraded to rune axe from steel i didnt notice any difference
2007scape,not_removed,now im conflicted
2007scape,not_removed,quicker
2007scape,not_removed,hercat is correct
2007scape,not_removed,show me some actual evidence then the tick system is is in place for any axe its factual not theory
2007scape,not_removed,the wiki has tons of info including guides for uim
2007scape,not_removed,i have an uim and decided to make a regular account on the side to play with an irl friend who started playing again i find myself enjoying my uim more for the achievements and because you really have to think how you are going to play the game non the less i also really enjoy playing with my friend ofcourse if youre thinking of making an uim i would highly recommend you doing it since its great fun if you ever need help just tell me your ign and we could add eachoter if you want
2007scape,not_removed,its just zulrah not zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,when i rejoined a few weeks back i enjoyed spending a while going through this sub and all its top voted stuff dank memes and very informative
2007scape,not_removed,o fuck totally forgot they added ge to dmm wish i had the time to play
2007scape,not_removed,you know you can change the color yourself right go craft some runes at whatever altar you want for the color you want with the pet out
2007scape,not_removed,lose it and reclaim it again see if you get a new colour for science
2007scape,not_removed,tf nobody ever told me this i thought it was special to have a specific pet color
2007scape,not_removed,those pets have a right click option to change their color though the rift guardian does not
2007scape,not_removed,ya science cough
2007scape,not_removed,no runecrafting did not get pets
2007scape,not_removed,lololololol
2007scape,not_removed,not the first repost though
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,no one has more than mole kc
2007scape,not_removed,lmao nex nex is my gf
2007scape,not_removed,kbd sir tony ray hey isnt that rsgloryandgold
2007scape,not_removed,jad
2007scape,not_removed,nex is my gf man thats one abusive relationship
2007scape,not_removed,player eiknaxui the name is a swear in lithuanian its equivalent to idi naxui you can hear this in csgo when russians rage
2007scape,not_removed,would be nice or just a boos high score for each boss
2007scape,not_removed,yes we need a data stream similar to what did we always get the excuse that the boss hiscores and so on require the web dev team to have free time to work on but why cant we just have a data stream like this in the meantime where we can be shown top boss killers fastest zulrah killers fastest fight cave times and so fourth unless this wasnt from one of their data streams then just ignore me but i think it would still be nice
2007scape,not_removed,thats all rubbish no way is the top dks kc that low ive done just under that in just over a year
2007scape,not_removed,someone has nearly qbd kills thats bank
2007scape,not_removed,i wonder what molehard is like does it sig more does it actualy attack you
2007scape,not_removed,is vindictahard really fucking hard or just not worth doing only kills
2007scape,not_removed,i had no idea there was versions of most bosses
2007scape,not_removed,yes please d
2007scape,not_removed,i love looking at this list and not knowing half the bosses
2007scape,not_removed,a highscore for killing time would be even cooler solo only for multi bosses though
2007scape,not_removed,kreearra jesus christ must be easy as fuck on i cant even imagine getting kree on osrs let alone kreearras
2007scape,not_removed,man i played until after drygores were released and i dont recognize half the bosses on that list
2007scape,not_removed,shouldnt some of these numbers be much higher by now
2007scape,not_removed,also add the recoord time
2007scape,not_removed,if we get one then please at least have horizontal dividers between
2007scape,not_removed,most kbd kills yahoooooooooooooo
2007scape,not_removed,yahooooo
2007scape,not_removed,lol kacy has more corp kc than the top player on
2007scape,not_removed,saw kreearra kills and was like what then i was like oh yeah its loleasyscape nvm and then i was chill
2007scape,not_removed,theres basically no point to kill mole in
2007scape,not_removed,thats wierd there is someone on oldschool with
2007scape,not_removed,mole is actually a pain in the ass on its been updated to do lots of different attacks and has high as fuck hp
2007scape,not_removed,my exact thoughts lmao i specifically looked for mole
2007scape,not_removed,yup
2007scape,not_removed,all of those are from fight kilns where u kill jads and other tzhaar monsters each kiln which takes about
2007scape,not_removed,english
2007scape,not_removed,isnt that what this is
2007scape,not_removed,proof plz
2007scape,not_removed,nothing compared to araxxor kills which is
2007scape,not_removed,it has some special annoying aoe attack and digs around like its on meth
2007scape,not_removed,it has hp so each kill takes like mins and its aids in general
2007scape,not_removed,takes minutes and isnt really worth it
2007scape,not_removed,yep its the reason i prefer for bossing whereas i enjoy osrs for the tryhard skilling methods that people are always coming up with
2007scape,not_removed,they cant do that on because people abused bugs with instakill darts and got one second kills on most of these i dont know how that would work on osrs
2007scape,not_removed,no they buffed it just dedication
2007scape,not_removed,you can afk gwd with soul split
2007scape,not_removed,the counter likely hasnt existed that long on much more reason to kill corp on
2007scape,not_removed,elysian sigil most expensive on is like only so corp is not really worth killing in
2007scape,not_removed,he solod all those though vs kacy who boosted kills
2007scape,not_removed,do you really expect a boss that came out years ago to still be hightier combat no mmo is like that thatd be boring as fuck
2007scape,not_removed,what a shocker a boss released years ago is easy to kill in the present time
2007scape,not_removed,but like no one had ever killed more then or does this list start count from when it was made
2007scape,not_removed,storgie has with no pet
2007scape,not_removed,yahooooooo
2007scape,not_removed,makes sense i dunno much about anymore how sad
2007scape,not_removed,guess it would be equivalent to go fuck yourself
2007scape,not_removed,no it just lists the person with the most kills not highscores for everyone
2007scape,not_removed,nigga what edit before he edited it it said isnt that what my what that is
2007scape,not_removed,is super low highly doubt hed lie about that
2007scape,not_removed,or osrs
2007scape,not_removed,source
2007scape,not_removed,there is with qbd kills though so it cant be too new
2007scape,not_removed,that and most people on use lscs that probably doesnt count towards your kc on its always ffa
2007scape,not_removed,you say that but solo corp to get a sigil drop is bank you earn well over and a drop is a nice boost to that
2007scape,not_removed,it is probably because of being a very low profit boss and pet hunting after killing it times the pet passes a threshold and the hard mode drop rate goes from to at kills hard mode drops to most people get their pet in that range of kills id assume
2007scape,not_removed,i dont have a clue when the counter came out but its probably been like years maybe that kc is a mistake though as its very low
2007scape,not_removed,the counter started sometime in the summer of last year they were not tracked before that
2007scape,not_removed,cranberry was before getting his pet
2007scape,not_removed,dont even need to know about in this case since fight kiln came out in
2007scape,not_removed,thats like hours with rates probably like the time on
2007scape,not_removed,osrs
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,hes not kidding source i play
2007scape,not_removed,corp isnt as good money on as it is on
2007scape,not_removed,not true to get kc on all you need to do is touch the boss the drop doesnt even have to be yours
2007scape,not_removed,yes but with the stats to solo corp you could just camp araxxi instead and earn like twice that amount
2007scape,not_removed,that makes sense if theres no reason to kill the mole then i guess kills is a lot
2007scape,not_removed,how people can kill a boss that many times and not get the pet without giving up is insane
2007scape,not_removed,okay what are you trying to prove
2007scape,not_removed,more like osrs
2007scape,not_removed,oh lol
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it is absolutely pointless except for pet hunting and almost all pet hunters use hard mode which takes longer and does actual damage in exchange for a better pet rate
2007scape,not_removed,anything for harambe support
2007scape,not_removed,clicks out for harambe

2007scape,not_removed,if you mean the demonic gorillas hell no the click box is perfect making it bigger would make it hard to click on the right one when of them are close together
2007scape,not_removed,idk it seems like this would make it easier to kill harambe no support from me
2007scape,not_removed,actually gorillas have among the smallest penis sizes of all the primates at inches erect so youre more correct than you think
2007scape,not_removed,dickpumpsforharambe

2007scape,not_removed,i did my first medium clue today i had to do new quests and spend hours on it and it was worth i took a break after that
2007scape,not_removed,my first easy clue got me a wizard hat t for and nothing has been worth that much since
2007scape,not_removed,hey thats nice they even gave you the nats to alch it

2007scape,not_removed,didnt block out name gg account
2007scape,not_removed,bro i got longs on my first easy clue
2007scape,not_removed,tbh if you had to do new quests for a medium clue its worth it all easy and medium clue requirements are very important or easy to get on a new account besides items which are just cheap
2007scape,not_removed,shit are you me i wear that gilded wizard hat around as proud as i possibly can
2007scape,not_removed,what happens when you dont block out name new to this sub reddit
2007scape,not_removed,mediums no boots at all
2007scape,not_removed,wizards and sandals here in
2007scape,not_removed,meds and holy sandals at about no rangers or wizs
2007scape,not_removed,got sandals and rangers in clues
2007scape,not_removed,i got holy sandals on my first clue scroll that i was actually able to complete was easy too
2007scape,not_removed,completely true i dont typically focus my time on questing and doing clue scrolls is a good way to get myself to do them i guess with a possibility of good loot on the side
2007scape,not_removed,just silly meme about accounts getting hacked if they leave identifying information on screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,i ban evader there gps i hate wortel

2007scape,not_removed,fight the system vote ice
2007scape,not_removed,vote for him in what where is the link lad
2007scape,not_removed,vote for ice
2007scape,not_removed,personally the only osrs streamer i watch is mrnosleep
2007scape,not_removed,idk if this is just a joke thread but is currently doing a month of constant streaming for charity i think that itself is worth the gnome i also prefer him as a streamer to be honest though
2007scape,not_removed,yo people who like him why is it i have not really given it a chance but i rarely stay long in channels where the host is a hyper active cocaine fuelled nightmare
2007scape,not_removed,nope
2007scape,not_removed,no his fanbase is absolute cancer haha lets just spam racistretarded shit and add a casual cx haha
2007scape,not_removed,nah dont want some asshole representing the game
2007scape,not_removed,ill pass thanks haha wow alright then since im already at for stating something that goes against the narrative fuck you guys
2007scape,not_removed,voted emily
2007scape,not_removed,hell no not for that turd
2007scape,not_removed,i mean is just more dedicated in every way js
2007scape,not_removed,cringing
2007scape,not_removed,lol he barely streams osrs anymore
2007scape,not_removed,ice is the only name ive heard of i watched boatys stream a few days ago and he seems annoying always constantly clicking his prayer try hards are no bueno
2007scape,not_removed,woox is not from the uk they are the popular streamers regardless of location your comment is invalid
2007scape,not_removed,at runefest sure
2007scape,not_removed,oh come on he was super entertaining as a youtuber but hes terrible at streaming its not like he has an unlimited supply of doors that he can chainsaw to pieces
2007scape,not_removed,even funnier skill specs mustered any votes
2007scape,not_removed,you can vote in game
2007scape,not_removed,ingame
2007scape,not_removed,ice poseidon has been raising awareness for autism since the day he began streaming he has even encouraged individuals who have autism to not hold themselves back now we have wonderful streamers like alison quinn who without ice may have never streamed or engaged in such social activity
2007scape,not_removed,no its not worth good for him that hes doing charity but that has nothing to do with how good he is as a streamer if youre gonna vote for him because hes doing charity then idk
2007scape,not_removed,im probably wrong about this but is it possible he does the charity month is used to cover himself with taxes i have no clue how taxes work in the uk but could it be just for tax deductions so he doesnt have to worry about paying them out of his normal income from streaming
2007scape,not_removed,he makes the game look fun and engaging i dont wanna see some fuckhead skill for hours that shit isnt entertaining
2007scape,not_removed,we are voting streamers not the fanbase
2007scape,not_removed,then gtfo
2007scape,not_removed,most sensible comment ive seen on this sub in awhile
2007scape,not_removed,smorc kapper in the chat bois whale meme occult necklace thanks for the month sub
2007scape,not_removed,imo is the best streamer to ever exist during dmm hype after that its so boring so i dont watch it
2007scape,not_removed,hahah well memed my friend
2007scape,not_removed,best osrs streamer of the year he gained popularity while streaming rs for the last year and he plays more than half of the days he streams
2007scape,not_removed,well for the year in question
2007scape,not_removed,he fucked himself with this poll he had momentum coming into it barely streaming osrs while blowing up with other games im sure im not the only one who felt abandoned as someone who plays rs and enjoys rs streams on the other hand streamed every single day leading up to this poll consistently bringing the rs content
2007scape,not_removed,woosh
2007scape,not_removed,why feed the trolls man staywoke
2007scape,not_removed,isnt a friend from lithuania
2007scape,not_removed,to be honest i find of streaming incredibly boring
2007scape,not_removed,i said i prefer him as a streamer too
2007scape,not_removed,none of the other nominees are boring so thats a terrible argument i want to know why he is better
2007scape,not_removed,yes but his fanbase is they it is because of how he acts in his streams are you completely oblivious to that
2007scape,not_removed,lets be honest he blew up in popularity after pokemon go is gonna win anyway so kinda pointless to even talk about who cares
2007scape,not_removed,id say its a good tradeoff overall he gets a lot more money and attention but doesnt win an rs award i know which one id pick
2007scape,not_removed,someones gotta do it
2007scape,not_removed,a friend isnt a streamer
2007scape,not_removed,well lets see hes a top tier pker knows game mechanics by heart he actually interacts with his viewers in game he hosts community events he takes on real challenges ironman mode is a challenge for cowards a real mans challenge is pvp world questing while youre getting hunted he has given out millions upon millions of gp he has closed doors in order to bring the community together he has tested the dmm beta he is and on the other hand we have some ginger that skills on stream resident af bro
2007scape,not_removed,i understand that but you can control a fanbase only so much for example when ice stops streaming ive seen him many times to tell his viewers to not raid other streamers with racist stuff if they still do it then yeah and for the racist stuff itself how is that because of how he acts ice doesnt show any racism himself
2007scape,not_removed,nah
2007scape,not_removed,boaty isnt going to win and he had over viewers multiple times before pokemon and had consistant viewers before it which is amazing for rs
2007scape,not_removed,are you dumb or just stupid
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i dont blame him he seemed to be bored of rs anyways
2007scape,not_removed,a friend can be whatever he wants to be
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt say he was i asked a question which nobody has yet to answer so ill google it myself ya biggity bitch
2007scape,not_removed,i dont watch boaty he too is a hyper fuck woox paul keeferz these guys are good streamers they act like they would in public i dont wanna mute them but i guess everyone has their tastes even if other peoples are stupid
2007scape,not_removed,nah
2007scape,not_removed,hes leading by quite a bit atm ice lost a lot of rs viewers after he abandoned the game for pokemon go etc idc who wins but itll most likely be hes too popular within rs
2007scape,not_removed,but he will always be our friend
2007scape,not_removed,heeeeeell nah
2007scape,not_removed,i believe in daddy
2007scape,not_removed,im doing the boss in a trio
2007scape,not_removed,i believe its the person who did the most damage gets half the slayer xp and the person with the last hit gets half so if you do neither of those no slayer xp not totally sure though but i think so
2007scape,not_removed,waiting for season like the aussies are waiting for their servers
2007scape,not_removed,sick rm reference
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,or in my case oh boy here i go cannonballing again
2007scape,not_removed,theyre drawing it
2007scape,not_removed,cant use the ge just wait until the new ge antiscam update
2007scape,not_removed,if imagine having both systems active and using one based off account type would be far more difficult than it sounds
2007scape,not_removed,alch prices arent the only thing that matters a bcp is more valuable than a godsword shard
2007scape,not_removed,waste of dev time
2007scape,not_removed,there shouldnt be a different system for ironmen who die during pvp and normal accounts who die during pvp you should be able to have a general idea what your opponent is risking without having to figure out whether or not theyre an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,how do you change the color of font in your chat
2007scape,not_removed,httpsimgurcomakwayw bruh
2007scape,not_removed,i use the osbuddy client if you type in color in the search bar in settings you get a chat recolor option fidget with it
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy and konduit have options for it runeloader might too but i have no experience with it
2007scape,not_removed,in total i used prayer pots adding drops to the amount i started with super cmb pots ranging pots sharks lobsters bp addy darts total supplies cost total loot without shardstail total loot with shardstail this took around hours to do so i wouldnt recommend it unless youre feeling lucky p
2007scape,not_removed,why do you take so much food i take scb range pots restores anguish neck blow pipe sgs rest sharks if youre praying right you shouldnt need that much food i can do kill trips nice loot though
2007scape,not_removed,i switch prayers always after getting hit with a new style one time i cant do better than that i dont think i get like kills per trip i bring this ratio because i almost always and up with no foodprayer pots left i sip cmb and rang once when i enter the cave also thanks
2007scape,not_removed,how in the hell do you hold kills worth of drops in your inv
2007scape,not_removed,you can definitely do better than that just remember every three he hits he will change his attack style also if youre praying melee and hes about to switch to rangemage always pray mage because its more accurate than the range attack
2007scape,not_removed,i bring rune pouch for alches
2007scape,not_removed,i know and do all of that but it still works out this way my max one trip was kills
2007scape,not_removed,you will see an influx of why was i banned posts in this subreddit
2007scape,not_removed,xd
2007scape,not_removed,seems to be happening rn and all of them apparently took a month off of rs and had their accs stolen botted on
2007scape,not_removed,yea lmao the jmods run twitch
2007scape,not_removed,you need to learn whats a twitch issue and whats a runescape issue this is the wrong location for twitch issues report the stream
2007scape,not_removed,one small favour
2007scape,not_removed,if you go down to the chart for the quests you can organize the quest points column by clicking on the arrow below it it will organize quests by their quest points ascdesc
2007scape,not_removed,just get the quest cape during my b glove grind i developed questing fever and did all of them the cape tele is super worth
2007scape,not_removed,tears of guthix is seconds long
2007scape,not_removed,youtube fastest barrow gloves osrs not sure which guy it is but hell basically give you the quickest quests to do
2007scape,not_removed,yeah perfect quick and easy quest points
2007scape,not_removed,i also did this qp in a few months in like weeks
2007scape,not_removed,its
2007scape,not_removed,thats a good joke it makes way more sense to make a bunch of untested changes which make the game worse and having the bugs in place on release it would be stupid to save the high scores for the tournament and rerelease the seasonals with the proposed changes on a purely testing basis to see if they will work
2007scape,not_removed,did you even read the post or they let us know the changes before the season comes so we can give feedback if we want it changed before its too late not release a whole season to test before the seasons out your comment makes no sense
2007scape,not_removed,i did i was trying to be sarcastic clearly that doesnt work online i think that your suggestions are reasonable ill be surprised if they give much information or test their dmm plans much easier to keep us in the dark try it on the live game and ignore the build up of hype i wish they did radical things to fix dmm xp loss restoration as you suggested is probably the biggest one dying sucks in dmm but its the loss of xp when dying which is the worst making rebuilding easier will improve the game
2007scape,not_removed,its a safe death
2007scape,not_removed,safe death itemswise you lose contribution points for yourself and the team i believe though
2007scape,not_removed,safe death as in you do not lose items or gear you only lose participation points which affects your reward it should be noted that any items left on the ground will be lost if you dc leave the raid finish the raid or get booted so dropping gear in order to pickup an item or something is most definitely not recommended i already see scamming occurring where a raid leader convinces someone to drop bandos or something then boots them from the raid and then picks their items up
2007scape,not_removed,it uses prices that its users pay for items
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think it uses osrs api pretty sure it tracks what its users buysell for and simply records that
2007scape,not_removed,the runescape website has a ge feature that monitors and reports when and how many of an item are traded it uses that system really summed up explanation example
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy cant see your password
2007scape,not_removed,thats not how osbuddy gets its prices it basically just takes note of everything osb users buy and sell at the grand exchange and gets its prices that way
2007scape,not_removed,how do you know
2007scape,not_removed,i get that your post is satire but osbuddy can see you password it just chooses not to the developers make plenty off pro subs
2007scape,not_removed,whats the use make it riskless to use void and allow people to take it wilderness no thanks
2007scape,not_removed,so dont change anything but make the void useless outside pvp
2007scape,not_removed,i thought of that after i posted could just make it so it doesnt work past wild
2007scape,not_removed,no did you read it
2007scape,not_removed,barrows chests and still no gloves smh
2007scape,not_removed,you actually got higher then average luck on barrows items also gz on thats drop rate is and u managed
2007scape,not_removed,i cant tell if this makes me want to more barrows runs or never do another barrows run again
2007scape,not_removed,whats your setupmethod cant seem to find any up to date methods especially since the release of the barrows tab
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice dude couple questions out of curiosity roughly how much did you spend on supplies how many minutes did a run take to complete
2007scape,not_removed,got my first ahrims top today at chest how nice to see youve gotten
2007scape,not_removed,pretty lucky on the torags hammers
2007scape,not_removed,shows the difference in barrows item prices these days my chests from december totalled in the end
2007scape,not_removed,rip k coif and bow
2007scape,not_removed,im jealous of the karils tops ive done chests too and not had a single one hell i only got the skirt in the
2007scape,not_removed,also stats like actual stats that were used in doing trips
2007scape,not_removed,gear setup and inventory
2007scape,not_removed,just started doing barrows runs on my account about in and the best drop was a elite clue heres to hoping i have your luck going forwards
2007scape,not_removed,how much u spend on runes
2007scape,not_removed,guthans set only feelsbadman
2007scape,not_removed,so its about average per chest kinda nice to know d grats though man if youre an ironman youre set for life
2007scape,not_removed,what a waste of minutes
2007scape,not_removed,how do you people think of this shit
2007scape,not_removed,when i first started i was getting very lucky
2007scape,not_removed,decimals in fractals reeeeeeeeeeeeee
2007scape,not_removed,i use way mage switch with trident ice barrage verac then way switch into blowpipe for ahrims and tunnel i use void range since it is the bis but you can substitute
2007scape,not_removed,jakeyosaurus has a pretty detailed and thorough barrows guide httpsyoutubeqnhvvzzbixo i did what he did basically but just downgraded my gear and used ring of dueling to restore everything
2007scape,not_removed,i spent around on supplies most of that coming from trident charges with bad rng long tunnels bad hits it would take me minutes a chest making it around hour for me i also have morytania hard diary completed and got kc every chest
2007scape,not_removed,bad luck man im pretty sure i got very lucky on expensive items
2007scape,not_removed,started with mage range attack and def and strength
2007scape,not_removed,i changed my gear around a lot but what i mostly used was helm of neitznot ahrims top and bottom dboots fury barrows gloves god dhide switch trident of the swamp blowpipe dragon defender whip dds and every chest i would teleport to clan wars and then tele back using arceuus spellbook
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i actually couldnt fit about loot in inventory haha
2007scape,not_removed,they saw it posted elsewhere
2007scape,not_removed,fractals
2007scape,not_removed,are you implying decimals in fraction is not a valid notation
2007scape,not_removed,lol so would probabilityodds be the most triggering subject on earth for you decimals in fractions being very common
2007scape,not_removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
2007scape,not_removed,you only need kc to max runes after that you get more bolt racks
2007scape,not_removed,you could have made more gphr getting
2007scape,not_removed,whats mory hard do for you in relevance to barrows trips
2007scape,not_removed,after
2007scape,not_removed,the disorganization of the loot throws my ocd off a bit but nice dedication
2007scape,not_removed,how do people think of this shit
2007scape,not_removed,he prefers it to be typed like
2007scape,not_removed,am i right in saying that technically kill count is better than for gp from average chest due to bolt racks being cheaper
2007scape,not_removed,funny thing is i didnt know this until around in so i thought i might as well keep going
2007scape,not_removed,hahaha i stayed up super late to finish chest and i just wanted to put it in ge before going to bed thank you though
2007scape,not_removed,you saw that posted elsewhere
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,yes thats the point
2007scape,not_removed,how big of a deal is this on profitsprofitshr
2007scape,not_removed,ive always observed the or skeletons plus the brothers rule based on word of mouth but never actually checked if the numbers match up or if its still relevant based on changing prices
2007scape,not_removed,is the rule still true if you havent finished the diaries for extra runes
2007scape,not_removed,pretty big since the runes is a big part of your income
2007scape,not_removed,it will essentially make you always profit as long as you get killcount
2007scape,not_removed,it really should be its such a classic and saving up your tickets is generates another reason to get membership totally changes the landscape of what cw is known as dominated by ice spells and such
2007scape,not_removed,id play castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,please jagex do this i loved castle wars back in the day and even though im a member id play for it
2007scape,not_removed,i know they plan to do a mini games rejuvenation next year this idea needs to be considered
2007scape,not_removed,not a bad idea but they should really look at other changes too the one good reward castle wars has halos takes a stupid amount of time to get which just begs people to afk id play the hell out of cw if it just gave me some incentive besides the gameplay like pest control does with the xp and gp rewards
2007scape,not_removed,would love to have it but then again catching the flag will be super easy since theres no barrages just bind
2007scape,not_removed,it would be more fun to play castle wars without ancients and shit anyway
2007scape,not_removed,i support this castlewars should be shouldve been since was released
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure if making it would make it popular again though would be nice
2007scape,not_removed,have you seen servers so so empty
2007scape,not_removed,thing is all it would do is encourage more bots to afk there
2007scape,not_removed,id give this a hundred upvotes if i could deserve something fun like castle wars us players have plenty of other things to do
2007scape,not_removed,with only bind to stop them
2007scape,not_removed,how would it work without barrage though its a really important aspect of cw and bind spells are pretty expensive specially for a player
2007scape,not_removed,support great idea
2007scape,not_removed,holy please let this come true
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,soul wars activity counter it killed afking in soul wars why not castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,id vote for this why not although as someone who isnt a developer i cant imagine how easyhard this would be not a simple copy paste job i imagine
2007scape,not_removed,i support this sounds amazing fun in
2007scape,not_removed,id fuck with cw so hard if there were free runes i cant afford to barrage for funsies
2007scape,not_removed,itd be fun to play cw in but remember that a main in full rune wont die to anyone unless theres like a pile on him
2007scape,not_removed,might be an unpopular opinion but could open tournament worlds every few months where people can play castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,it seems pretty damn popular whenever im in the cw world when a game ends the place is filled
2007scape,not_removed,omg cw i didnt know i wanted this until now no barrage
2007scape,not_removed,plz
2007scape,not_removed,castle wars would be amazing
2007scape,not_removed,it would create an incentive to become thus more players becoming
2007scape,not_removed,make some sort of teleport that brings them directly there allow them to buy up to the armor is members dont nerf tickets in everyone should be able to enjoy cancer free castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,not really seeing how it would work without barrage sabotaging would be way more effective and in full rune would be almost unkillable not the worst idea it would just require tweaks to the way barricades and bandages work for it to really be viable
2007scape,not_removed,the only reason i got membership was for cw if it goes so do i
2007scape,not_removed,it would be pretty cool to see the map used in clan wars for both and if people are against castle wars being in
2007scape,not_removed,ahh yet another great suggestion that would benefit everyone that wont be put into game dispute it not being difficult to implement
2007scape,not_removed,support can you imagine how fun it would be if all anyone could use is binds and fire blasts and rune it would be absolute mayhem but it would increase the strategy required behind using barracades significantly considering people can hardly be frozen nearly as long
2007scape,not_removed,hell add decorative full helms as an additional members reward
2007scape,not_removed,i like the idea but youd have to have split lobbies for and i cant imagine it would be enjoyable for a bunch of midlevel players in rune armour and green dhide to get consistently destroyed by barrages ballistas and hit with whips the idea is nice but very impractical
2007scape,not_removed,hey i love this idea the problem of max mains being unable to die to weapons will have to be addressed if all players defense were set at like or that might help
2007scape,not_removed,have an upvote makecastlewarsgreatagain
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,they need to have a castle wars only world like tournaments worlds or the old bh world where you couldnt go further south then edge where if youre logged into that world the only thing you have access to is castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,honestly if this game was brought to id start playing it im a member already but in members servers there are always or players on each team who are simply far superior in gear and stats and it makes it really impossible for midgame and beginner players to have any part in it i feel like by limiting the effectiveness of stats by limiting the gear available ie a lot more can be done by all people who play it
2007scape,not_removed,i do think is playing a far different role than it was back in ideas like this are exactly what needs
2007scape,not_removed,i just want to play proper populated cw again i miss the days of barraging in the center
2007scape,not_removed,all yall saying youd play cw if it was go play it now i understand ib and all but it cant be that bad i dont like cw now and i wouldnt play if it was still a nice idea though upvoted
2007scape,not_removed,i support this idea
2007scape,not_removed,huge support great idea i dont see any problems with this
2007scape,not_removed,yes please please best update ever would keep me from canceling membership when completiomn cape comes out
2007scape,not_removed,theyd need to fix castle wars before this as i can already see the problems mainly with the barricades
2007scape,not_removed,thats a great suggestion it would be cool to see castle wars
2007scape,not_removed,i think making the lobby instanced would be a problem teleport to castle wars is pretty useful and it would be annoying for that teleport to be less useful if the portals were removed from the current lobby and two portals were added that take you to an instanced lobby one portal at castle wars current one at clan wars as you proposed i think thatd be a good solution i wont be the one playing it but id probably still vote for it in a poll i wouldnt vote for any of the rewards except the decorative though
2007scape,not_removed,while i wouldnt mind players being able to play cw it really isnt going to revive cw or make it popular again lol
2007scape,not_removed,how about simply adding more useful rewards to the minigame thinking
2007scape,not_removed,isnt there the issue that you cant spec in a server surely the server will be dead
2007scape,not_removed,im not quite sure how an instanced waiting room would help you say it removes the min wait but that means youd have multiple games per world which just makes them emptier also no runescape font used
2007scape,not_removed,how will it work though im sure that many members will keep doing castle wars in member worlds because of all the items and spells that means it wouldnt help them in fact it might actually lose them players because they decide to farm the tickets in instead on the other hand if you somehow allow players to join castle wars games will they get access to items and spells personally i dont mind this but i just dont see it working out
2007scape,not_removed,may as well just give access to everything in the way were going
2007scape,not_removed,i think if they had xp lamps as a reward that would fix some of the issue
2007scape,not_removed,poll dclaws as a cwars reward imo
2007scape,not_removed,yeah fuck ice barrage its so cancer at cw and everywhere else
2007scape,not_removed,they should make gamers grotto again itll be easier for to get to minigames
2007scape,not_removed,wouldve been a golden comment if you said youd pay for to play cw
2007scape,not_removed,could make bandages heal less in think that would solve it
2007scape,not_removed,then wont it just a be a game where more points are scored like the average match will end in instead of i dont see a problem
2007scape,not_removed,why are you always such a logical cunt
2007scape,not_removed,there was no when was released
2007scape,not_removed,it would probably get a surge of popularity and then die again
2007scape,not_removed,have you tried the wilderness or better yet the clan wars portal
2007scape,not_removed,lol my experience the only way even get in a game is to pay into a planned lobby
2007scape,not_removed,we can have bots play castle wars problem solved
2007scape,not_removed,why do they deserve anything theyre not paying for the game to keep it alive
2007scape,not_removed,its pretty effective i remember getting piled by people with fire blast back in the day and died really quickly
2007scape,not_removed,after actually reading the suggestion it looks like itd just be a case of making the relevant cwars items so they wouldnt appear as members objects and then making it so the exit portal teleports you back to clan wars instead of the main castle wars lobby
2007scape,not_removed,people would use it just to bank
2007scape,not_removed,whats wrong with the barricades
2007scape,not_removed,i hope thats a troll definitely the most skilled mini game there is if you play properly
2007scape,not_removed,its a minigame for fun
2007scape,not_removed,mage is so underpowered damage wise compared to range and melee yoy csnt get speced out by a mage spell ice barrage is all they have
2007scape,not_removed,but what is cw without ice barrage
2007scape,not_removed,says a person who doesnt have magic presumably
2007scape,not_removed,decent solution
2007scape,not_removed,probably there would be a lot more emphasis on cading and exploding them but once someone gets past the cades ur screwed because no freezes and if someone decides to sabo your team by using up all the cades then youre completely fucked maybe if bandages were entirely disabled for then it would be feasible to actually kill people but with how much bands heal and the damage output of weapons its just not possible how it currently is
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,well sadly some people are too unfortunate or not in a position to be able to pay for membership it doesnt mean that they shouldnt be able to enjoy the game like everyone else maybe if they can get a little taste of members activities and items then they may be more intrigued on purchasing a membership down the line when theyre in a more able position
2007scape,not_removed,rofl they might not pay for it directly but if im not mistaken they still have ads plus i dont really think adding a dead mini game there affects you in any way
2007scape,not_removed,well then ur just not good
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,yes which is why i said there would have to be split lobbies
2007scape,not_removed,the limit of barricades per team is set at a certain number i think so some random guy can just place all his barricades in a spot that would be deemed useless for his team thus limiting their team from placing anymore
2007scape,not_removed,just so you know pest control isnt actually instanced they just have separate games by using selective loading its the same way fight caves and likely nmz works
2007scape,not_removed,and id like to have one big minigame of two teams in a safe pvp and since osrs dev team only wanna go esports and doesnt give a shit about concepts of soul wars stealing creation and everything inbetween the easiest way to make castle wars big is good rewards exp rewards gambles tradeable items
2007scape,not_removed,so youd like it stay inactive then lol
2007scape,not_removed,back in the day castle wars is the only reason i got magic lol
2007scape,not_removed,why is that relevant whether someone can use a game breaking skill doesnt change if its gamebreaking
2007scape,not_removed,what if they added a weapon stand in the spawn room where you can take out weapons that would be the equivalent of a msb and gmaul with same specs that just get removed from inventory after the match
2007scape,not_removed,lets poll barrage for castle wars cx
2007scape,not_removed,you can die in clan wars walk like steps and die again easy xp
2007scape,not_removed,what of course it means they shouldnt be able to enjoy the game like the people who pay its a paid game is just a trial the whole point of paying is so that you can enjoy the game more
2007scape,not_removed,they dont have ads
2007scape,not_removed,i guess you have never clan war back in the day the short duration of binds made very interesting it meant you had to have most members have binds to help the team lock down a kill on the flipside other teams would target the binders as a counter and attempt to catch them in robes less variables than but meant strategies were much more crucial and systematic
2007scape,not_removed,oh really how would you respond in if you were snared by a clan of mages and were getting hit by multiple fire blasts
2007scape,not_removed,magic is game breaking
2007scape,not_removed,because its usually people who cant use it who bitch
2007scape,not_removed,bands have no delay between uses like when you eat normal food you dont normally ko people in cw unless theyre getting speared or something
2007scape,not_removed,i still clan
2007scape,not_removed,pray mage and easily tank
2007scape,not_removed,colesseum is cancelled for now
2007scape,not_removed,specifically ice barrage is game cw breaking
2007scape,not_removed,where did i say that
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,ah gotcha havnt played cw in years
2007scape,not_removed,most ppl have alt accounts to boost and boosting is difficult to make efficient
2007scape,not_removed,well you did say skill not spell
2007scape,not_removed,lmao have you ever played dmm look at how much time it takes to do lunar diplomacy and what mage level you need to get to cast heal other then look at how short a time span you have to get mage you really havent thought this through pm if you want a serious discussion of strategies
2007scape,not_removed,if creating teamsclans wasnt allowed jagex would have done something about them by now dont worry about breaking rules
2007scape,not_removed,im no expert on wyverns but the wiki says the only shields that work against wyverns are mind shield elemental shield and dragonfire shield
2007scape,not_removed,i was in a similar position sort of grinding out slayer to reach wyverns so i could finally make money finding open worlds for wyverns with range are cancer most of the spots are monopolized by a couple of clans and people will splash for hours just to hold their spot with the recent buff to slayer drop tables i would honestly say to dont stop slayer at to camp wyverns slayer gets much more profitable as you go on you will get some shitty tasks but its much better to level combat stats and gain money through it you can def meele them but unless you have proper gear and higher stats your trips will be pretty unrewarding
2007scape,not_removed,oh no guess i would need a dfs then
2007scape,not_removed,god bless you good sir this honestly helps so much more than the generic yeah get slayer so you can camp wyverns yeh but however im really need it of a decent money making method thats not merching and thats not super high requirements skilling ill bear that in mind however what other monsters are unlocked through higher slater level that gives as good gph than wyverns
2007scape,not_removed,mostly nechryaels gargoyles cave krakens abyssal demons
2007scape,not_removed,tasks such as a kurasks nechs gargoyles and i would suggest to do certain tasks like hell hounds and bloodvelds in the kourend catocombs you will get totem pieces which can be a nice amount of money every now and then skotizo is fairly easy to kill just look up a guide also you will be getting a lot of hard clue scrolls which can be rewarding sometimes and can often be a big chunk of profits
2007scape,not_removed,im a vegan
2007scape,not_removed,but what if they smoke weed do crossfit or are atheists
2007scape,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkwshhuypng
2007scape,not_removed,before you submitted this did you really look it over and think oh yeah this is awesome and i should tell people
2007scape,not_removed,before you submitted this did you laugh at your own joke dont break your arm patting yourself on the back
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,since when does holding the key autoclick it
2007scape,not_removed,if you spam click it no but if you hold the button and it autoclicks yes you will get banned for that
2007scape,not_removed,thatd be just like a rapid fire keyif osb mouse keys do that and yes of course a ban due to it staying in same coordinates without any fluctuation
2007scape,not_removed,cough download autoclicker
2007scape,not_removed,it has to be one click on keyboard mouse click as far as i know
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,max mahogany then coal for profit if you are not iron
2007scape,not_removed,i heard there is a new bench or such in the superior garden that uses or so teak planks and doesnt reload house like other teak things
2007scape,not_removed,i believe that the best things to build are teak levers in the throne room they are planks each
2007scape,not_removed,teak wardrobes use planks rates up to using a demon butler
2007scape,not_removed,oh my god youre right thanks dude you just saved me of my time lol
2007scape,not_removed,awesome thank you once i hit construction ill move onto those
2007scape,not_removed,this is correct going to try out teak benches though because the wardrobe hotspot feels clunky for some reason making tables feels sooo much smoother than wardrobes hopefully benches are smooth as well
2007scape,not_removed,dudes right levers are out teak benches are in
2007scape,not_removed,been testing with the new benches theres two hotspots right next to each other and you can remove one while youre building the other theres some weird glitches where you can walk into the bench and the butler can stand on top of it which makes it a bit annoying though
2007scape,not_removed,actually just did planks at benches this is amazing compared to wardrobes the hitboxes on all the hotspots next to the benches are annoying but if you zoom in you can just constantly make furniture super click intensive but definitely faster than wardrobes
2007scape,not_removed,neat thats a nice mechanic if you can simultaneously build on both hotspots you should see slightly higher xp rates
2007scape,not_removed,if you arent already try using the osbuddy proxy thing made the lag stop for me instantly
2007scape,not_removed,you sir are a fucking genius thank you
2007scape,not_removed,not sure if youre being sarcastic but if not dont thank me thank ursbmatt
2007scape,not_removed,hahahahhaahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
2007scape,not_removed,hilarious bro
2007scape,not_removed,could this be an epic new meme
2007scape,not_removed,i say we should make it construction just to fuck with people
2007scape,not_removed,a h a h a h a h a h a h a h a h
2007scape,not_removed,because to get a max cape you have to have construction
2007scape,not_removed,boostable right
2007scape,not_removed,noob
2007scape,not_removed,no you dont
2007scape,not_removed,make sure nieve isnt restricting your tasks to your combat level just talk to her and you can switch it on or off
2007scape,not_removed,you have to startfinish desert treasure to be able to be assigned dust devils
2007scape,not_removed,oh shit i had no idea imma get on that ive been putting off quests lmao
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,wtf is this
2007scape,not_removed,wut
2007scape,not_removed,blocks name at bottom forgets the name at the top
2007scape,not_removed,youll die maybe not now maybe not in a week but youll die
2007scape,not_removed,makes me feel awfuloz
2007scape,not_removed,literally my weekend except ahrims robe bottoms and robin hood hats in one
2007scape,not_removed,gratz dude did you complete any barrow sets
2007scape,not_removed,ive been playing rs since classic still no robins have showed up on my reward screen
2007scape,not_removed,what chest was the v helm
2007scape,not_removed,that awfuloz
2007scape,not_removed,thats the osbuddy acc name
2007scape,not_removed,well yeah this game mode is you vs the servers its bound to happen eventually and i know theres no preventing it
2007scape,not_removed,nah this was my first day
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,sorry for bad quality blame google
2007scape,not_removed,not as bad of quality as this post
2007scape,not_removed,resemblance is uncanny
2007scape,not_removed,that shit happened to my pure account i was a ftp pure and had total level so it says to set up display name and i cant someone mentioned signing in to so i did and now my character is stuck in but is still in osrs high scores pretty much youre fucked tho
2007scape,not_removed,ya but all my stats are in and id have to start over in osrs lol
2007scape,not_removed,how is your character stuck in
2007scape,not_removed,idk i was inactive for a while and i tried to log in it says need to set up a display name so i go to account settings on osrs and try to set a name it says you need a osrs total lvl of my total level is so i try to find help and i read online that i need to log in to and set the name so i do and when i do my character transferred to but my hiscores are still on osrs lmao
2007scape,not_removed,your account is in both and oars a account although they have different stats are in both games
2007scape,not_removed,while vpns arent specifically against the rules if you use a vpn that of botters use for example youre much much more likely to get flagged as a botter
2007scape,not_removed,you cheated
2007scape,not_removed,dont bot
2007scape,not_removed,i guess thats what my ban reason said but i have never used a macro only windows mouse keys
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt bot and the ban was for macroing anyway
2007scape,not_removed,the two are interchangeable
2007scape,not_removed,its gonna be great having a weapon thats actually a sword to use sometimes
2007scape,not_removed,im guessing yes but zgwd is the worst gwd boss by a longshot harder to tank worse rewards no btp
2007scape,not_removed,i hope it doesnt work there the prices of the items dropped by kril are already very low
2007scape,not_removed,what about when ashes to apples is released
2007scape,not_removed,melee defense and mage protect its not harder to tank and guthans for heals a sotdzs are nice drops and there will always have to be a worst of options its fine for a worst
2007scape,not_removed,reporting a bug doesnt give you immunity from consequence if you still abused it if you discover a bug you should stop doing it and report right away doing it again for the sake of recording it seems unneeded especially since the ingame reporting system is better to use for really serious bugs i wouldnt follow through and just do enough to verify that it is possible for example lets say youre an ironman who finds you can stake items you can go to the final confirmation screen and then decline but dont actually stake items since getting that far should be a bug in itself likewise if you find a glitch to spawn gp by accident you could do it again to verify it is repeatable and get a more details bug report but after that you shouldnt keep doing it since you should already be aware it is a glitch
2007scape,not_removed,because they abused the bug as well
2007scape,not_removed,if they reported then abused or vice versa then they will be banned or deironed in todays case
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the info
2007scape,not_removed,i kind of see what you mean as they say they could be demonstrating it but they could just want stuff like that on their ironman so how would you go about reporting a bug because youd get punished anyways
2007scape,not_removed,probably should also mention i am not certain on all that but that is how id go about it from what ive heard
2007scape,not_removed,right click the report button and click report game bug you wont get banned unless you abuse it
2007scape,not_removed,rsps norton teamspeak rip account
2007scape,not_removed,crop crop
2007scape,not_removed,well at least theyre giving us free double exp weekends on twitch
2007scape,not_removed,the dcs arent over what compensation are they supposed to give when it isnt over yet that is how i imagine people who keep demanding compensation for an issue that hasnt ended yet say they give us a couple days prematurely and then it continues for a month you gotta be a moron
2007scape,not_removed,haha i absolutely love that you posted this i have over hours on for honor over the past week and during every dc it made me think of osrs and how the devs should handle this situation
2007scape,not_removed,this is because for honor is a new ip and they dont want this effecting sales its a business move blizzard has been having server issues too and they arent doing compensation either
2007scape,not_removed,i agree with what your link showed give everyone in runescape that played during the dc timeperiod bonus experience and make monsters drop loot why not just give them all full bandos as well
2007scape,not_removed,the difference here is that this hardly costs anything for ubisoft opposed to jagex giving away free days for their subscription based game just imagine how much money itd cost them to give everyone days of subscription not defending them or anything just pointing out its absolutely not the same jagex should compensate for their shitty servers for once
2007scape,not_removed,i activated a bond last week i havent even been able to use it of the time thank god i got a vissy drop otherwise entire bond would have been wasted
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think we should be compensated wouldnt that be like rewarding the ddoser
2007scape,not_removed,jegbo plz
2007scape,not_removed,i think getting some xp boost over a weekend after this had blown over would be a great way to draw players back say theyre sorry and let people enjoy the game double xp was so much fun back in old rs
2007scape,not_removed,bonded accs to bot on and these cancer patients cant fix worlds
2007scape,not_removed,hes asking for compensation when its over u doofus
2007scape,not_removed,we should start asking now a lot of people are having issues using the product they paid for something solid from jagex like a promise to provide up to x days to people with a membership starting at or before y date at the time the issue is resolved is needed these posts are getting whiny but it is the time to ask and for some part of the community its a valid concern and not an attempt to get free stuff we need to bring up issues while theyre current and it will take time to make anything happen
2007scape,not_removed,you seem to be completely void of inner peace the type of person to be overcritical and negative of absolutely everything this is a gag post a comment like this may have been warranted if this was some type of long rant on how i demand my immediate compensation but other than that this has no place here perhaps this post was making a suggestion as to how this should be handled rather than as youve interpreted it immediate compensation being demanded did that ever cross your mind where does a presumption like yours even come from with the track record of jagex and how they treat their players in general this is quite a fitting post if you ask me the very least they could have done at this point was at least promise compensation will be made the fact that theyve taken a no comment approach to this whole thing isnt what anyone wants and is rather telling of the morale of this company no one has been demanding immediate compensation rather just asking for a clear cut answer on weather or not there will be any
2007scape,not_removed,you play hours a day assuming you have a full time job or go to school thats a lot of time to play a game a day unless youtube or twitch is your job
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure they did when it was abysmal do you not remember the horror of the wod launch a free weeks membership for days of inconvenience
2007scape,not_removed,double xp will never be in osrs it would have to be polled first and it wouldnt pass a poll
2007scape,not_removed,then ask for it when its over
2007scape,not_removed,then post it when its over gg ez
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,there are no horses in runescape especially not high ones buddy theres this thing about gags where theyre supposed to be funny these threads every minutes is not because every dumbass that hasnt an herod over the dcs is making threads demanding free membership and its gotten old very quickly so i dont give a shit about being nice to them because there is clearly not an ounce of thought behind their actions its the same post over and over it doesnt matter if the person is saying for honor gave people x for y maybe do like thees because the end result is the same fucking thing people are asking for membership to the tune a multitude of low effort uninspired threads every passing hour and it makes them look like asshats so i treat them as such we get plenty of interaction with jmods loads of qa streams when people have account troubles they can get answers on twitter what other companies do that most have shitty automated ticket systems they take our suggestions here seriously and we get to vote on what we want for content and you entitled cunts still maintain that jagex treats us like shit just because some server issues that are out of their hands werent fixed instantly youre kidding yourselves
2007scape,not_removed,weather your comment has an riamverysmart vibe to it
2007scape,not_removed,im really close to making that a copypasta
2007scape,not_removed,well maybe the problem is you assuming he works or goes to school
2007scape,not_removed,i had that particular week off but yes i do go to school
2007scape,not_removed,why would people not want free xp
2007scape,not_removed,he linked to what for honor did and theres no text post wtf are you talking about
2007scape,not_removed,i beg to differ my character identifies as a horse and smokes the dankest ranarr there is please apologize
2007scape,not_removed,fucking thank you someone reasonable
2007scape,not_removed,yeah the only way to get shit done is to make multiple posts about it also when people have account troubles they can get answers on twitter what other companies do that most have shitty automated ticket systems you do realize that is because jagexs actual support system is total shit right the only place people can get help with their account is through reddit or twitter also you are trying to use entitled like its an insult did you forget that we actually pay for this game and are entitled to having stable servers
2007scape,not_removed,oh i wasnt aware you were the only one who gets to determine whats humorous and what isnt if this doesnt match your sense of humor thats fine but to make a definitive statement as to whats funny and what isnt is nonsense and completely subjective afaik there are no similar gag posts of this nature what youre seeing are posts regarding the constant dcing i agree that is getting annoying regarding the discontentment amongst the community with the servers i cant see how anyone is being unreasonable people of whom have purchasedworked toward membership and are getting shorted out of it have every right to voice their concerns if this causes you to interpret someone as an asshat then go right ahead people want an answer and rightfully so jagexes wrap stems far beyond the current dc issues i dont think anyone can argue there are have been occurrences in the past as well as present occurrences that are not being handled as they should no ones claiming the dcing is in their hands and can be fixed instantly youre continuing to forge completely unfounded presumptions to justify your demeanor people are discontent with the fact that they cant play the game they paid money for nothing more nothing less no one is coming out and saying jagex is treating us like shit because of this and if they are theyre in the minority and are simply ignorant to the situation to broadly categorize everyone that voices their concerns regarding compensation under this jagex hating entitled asshat label is insanity
2007scape,not_removed,its dvd because its true unfortunately this tends to be the case with many redditorspeople in general so youll see that type of mentality get positively reenforced redditors usually arent the most contentoutgoingsociable people and their discontentment will resonate in their posts its fine to be madpassionate about something but when that something is of absolutely minute nature for someone to blow a lid out of no where is indicative of more going on imagine someone playing a song you say to them oh you like this song and they respond with yeah no shit moron why else would i fucking play it what are you retarded this is the mentality you see here people being extremely overcritical and negative no one of whom is genuinely happy with their livesthemselves would act in this manner its ok to get angryvoice your frustrations with situations of a greater magnitude but to go off on a post like this is telling people love to jump to conclusions with these things and instantly assume theyre getting hated on because theyre opposition is jealousinsecurehas low self esteem etc which could be the case but whats clear is there is a discontentment of some sort as for the root of it who knows people like to automatically assume things like this because it gives them something to hold against the other to create a feeling of superiority its rare people say these things because they reflect their genuine criticisms rather than just to reach a pretentious highground
2007scape,not_removed,did you just assume my crippling depression
2007scape,not_removed,should probably do something more productive with your life then
2007scape,not_removed,sorry to interrupt the debacle here but what the fuck are you two arguing about and why
2007scape,not_removed,oh i wasnt aware you were the only one who gets to determine whats humorous and what isnt if this doesnt match your sense of humor thats fine but to make a definitive statement as to whats funny and what isnt is nonsense and completely subjective afaik there are no similar gag posts of this nature what youre seeing are posts regarding the constant dcing i agree that is getting annoying regarding the discontentment amongst the community with the servers i cant see how anyone is being unreasonable people of whom have purchasedworked toward membership and are getting shorted out of it have every right to voice their concerns if this causes you to interpret someone as an asshat then go right ahead people want an answer and rightfully so jagexes wrap stems far beyond the current dc issues i dont think anyone can argue there are have been occurrences in the past as well as present occurrences that are not being handled as they should no ones claiming the dcing is in their hands and can be fixed instantly youre continuing to forge completely unfounded presumptions to justify your demeanor people are discontent with the fact that they cant play the game they paid money for nothing more nothing less no one is coming out and saying jagex is treating us like shit because of this and if they are theyre in the minority and are simply ignorant to the situation to broadly categorize everyone that voices their concerns regarding compensation under this jagex hating entitled asshat label is insanity
2007scape,not_removed,whats funny about take notes jagex there are no jokes no memes no references to anything except server disconnects and getting compensation for lost play time just like the other posts posted every hour in one form or another
2007scape,not_removed,your copypasta skills are out of this universe
2007scape,not_removed,yeah like feel superior in a videogames comments section
2007scape,not_removed,what even is a light ballista
2007scape,not_removed,tfw you block out different parts of your username revealing the entire thing while also not blocking out the part in the chatbox where he says your username
2007scape,not_removed,theyre extremely limited in what they can do with the cc system as its shared with friend chat system generally anything that isnt purely clientside would be out of the question
2007scape,not_removed,thats disappointing i was really hoping it could be a possibility
2007scape,not_removed,id like to see them changed to count as red dragons and replace the black dragonhide with red dragonhides
2007scape,not_removed,they already count for black dragons no point for red considering reds are already optional
2007scape,not_removed,theyd technically count as black dragons since theyre you know black also the black dhide and such
2007scape,not_removed,although they drop black dragonhide they do not count as black dragons for a slayer task
2007scape,not_removed,not yet i think
2007scape,not_removed,they used to be red dragons before the lava changed them
2007scape,not_removed,im aware but that doesnt make them red though because theyre now black lmao
2007scape,not_removed,you take a bucket of black paint and cover a red dragon head to toe in black paint its still a red dragon because thats its name thats what it is
2007scape,not_removed,well no because its a lava dragon we dont even have paint in rs wtf are you on about
2007scape,not_removed,clearly the dragons just took baths in this
2007scape,not_removed,just quick fyi last i checked torags hammers and dragon battle axes both protect over whips
2007scape,not_removed,maybe retards pk with a dragon lol
2007scape,not_removed,you understand that if they fix those item prices then the lurers will just switch to the next cheapest item that has high alch value the only real solution is to change from protecting based on alch value to ge value also its really funny to me that pvmers will carelessly loot whatever garbage they pk off these suiciders then complain about fixing death mechanics afterwards on reddit its the wilderness dont bring anything you arent willing to lose because pkers will find you
2007scape,not_removed,just stop looting dumb shit oh look noted better pick these up rite
2007scape,not_removed,idk i wish they made protect value go off ge value like bruh
2007scape,not_removed,or learn something is a lure and not be a retard no one just drops those items without it being a trap
2007scape,not_removed,attack pures use them with ddsgmaul
2007scape,not_removed,well considering it says dragon sword not dragon sword noted id guess that he didnt know it shouldnt have to be like that anyways you shouldnt have to not pick up something in order to save your items they should just fix it so the alch prices are finally correct
2007scape,not_removed,fuckin right i
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt change the fact that it needs fixing people pk with dragon all the time
2007scape,not_removed,name is in honor of the game runescape not dragonscape barrowscape godswordscape full bandos scape etc
2007scape,not_removed,meme man does it again
2007scape,not_removed,runescape is based off of magical runes not runite metal armour runes magic scape land magic land
2007scape,not_removed,why does his mouse have autism
2007scape,not_removed,will use this guide in the future
2007scape,not_removed,guide sucks
2007scape,not_removed,lul
2007scape,not_removed,is joel on skype yet
2007scape,not_removed,depends if youre fletching or not
2007scape,not_removed,why fletch
2007scape,not_removed,because it gives more firemaking exp some people like to do that
2007scape,not_removed,gives less
2007scape,not_removed,burning a fletched log gives more exp than a regular log
2007scape,not_removed,yes but overall you burn less logs so its less exp fletching is only good for more points
2007scape,not_removed,i never said it was better exp per hour some people do it so that would affect the ratio that op is asking about
2007scape,not_removed,removed for obvious reasons if you have account names i suggest tweeting them to jagex
2007scape,not_removed,why do u think he streams when the mods are sleeping
2007scape,not_removed,legal action the boy tried asking for help on some subreddit on legal advice and got shitted on
2007scape,not_removed,someone should just end his life
2007scape,not_removed,has a moderator spoken on this recently
2007scape,not_removed,i kinda like some of his videos mainly his sketches like his runescape trailers and shit those were pretty funny
2007scape,not_removed,returnofwilderness suffers from a form of psychosis
2007scape,not_removed,row has funny vids but how the fuck does anyone still trust him
2007scape,not_removed,he needs to get removed from youtube completely
2007scape,not_removed,arent the rs mods sleeping
2007scape,not_removed,do you understand timezones
2007scape,not_removed,lmfao i need to see this got a link
2007scape,not_removed,that wasnt him if you read the edit it specifies it was only a fan pretending to be him
2007scape,not_removed,the boy is no good and belongs behind bars
2007scape,not_removed,a j mod did say all of his known ips and any accounts linked to him are banned on sight
2007scape,not_removed,he doesnt have a main he plays rs to rwt he doesnt actually play the game
2007scape,not_removed,removed from life completely
2007scape,not_removed,he streams at night in the same time zone as the mods
2007scape,not_removed,yes considering he was streaming at around am
2007scape,not_removed,i need to see this too
2007scape,not_removed,remindme
2007scape,not_removed,he does play the game he streams constantly only at night though people will trade him on stream and hell decline then after stream hell message them to do a trust trade its actually hilarious because somebody traded him on stream today and he gave it back little did everyone know it was just his account trying to gain his viewers trust once again his channel really needs to be terminated permanently there is enough significant proof jagex can use to get it taken down again as he uses the channel to scam players
2007scape,not_removed,removed from marina completely
2007scape,not_removed,remindme
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,nope unless you have the ibans staff before the first day ends and are pking ready at that time ibans is pretty much useless after day unless you manage to get high range so many people rush dt now and youll fall behind while youre pking with ibans
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think itd be worth it once people get pray mage it becomes useless unless you have high ranged
2007scape,not_removed,makes sense i guess my intial logic was that i could budget pk with ibans free death runes from raising cats ill just redirect my efforts to ancients thanks gents

2007scape,not_removed,probably duo sara with cbowdiamond e bolts
2007scape,not_removed,zammy is super easy if youre both on task with archlight
2007scape,not_removed,you should get your stats up higher first theyre not ideal for duoing
2007scape,not_removed,black chins on long range
2007scape,not_removed,the fastest is probably using nmz with low defense quest monsters other than that slayer is a good option and sandrock crabs are a good option sand crabs are very afk nmz is afk and slayer requires a decent amount of attention if youre not interested in the absolute fastest way andor you get bored chaos druids or elder chaos druids with protect from magic and seven prayer gear with a looting bag are decent exp and will make you decent money my advice would be to do a few levels at each place to change up the scenery tldr nightmare zone with low def bosses sandrock crabs slayer use a dragon scim and get a defender attstr if you want if not use an obby shield or zammy book change up methods if bored
2007scape,not_removed,if you have long term goals to get void just do pest control with a whip on defensive bring regular combat pots for a good xp boost for minimal cost it wont be the fastest but it will get you void and a few good levels
2007scape,not_removed,slayer or if you want full xp do yaks if youve done the fremmy quests i did yaks from atkstrdef
2007scape,not_removed,slayer
2007scape,not_removed,didnt say his mage level barrage with defence isnt slower attacks
2007scape,not_removed,pest control is not good for xp slow and boring if youre gonna do void and want it fast find a pc cc and portal rush min games
2007scape,not_removed,fastest
2007scape,not_removed,i did specify that it wouldnt be fast but if op plans to get void anyway itll be two birds with one stone
2007scape,not_removed,that is his ultimate ironman
2007scape,not_removed,no he didnt die on hc
2007scape,not_removed,fuck off heart skipped a beat there lmao i love wim aka lowlander and really want to see him go far full homo
2007scape,not_removed,lol trollzor
2007scape,not_removed,if you lower ranged strength of rigour to then its same as eagle eye lmao its only more ranged strength youre ok with ags hitting because why
2007scape,not_removed,fully agree insignias have no place in runescape im afraid many players including myself will quit on release
2007scape,not_removed,why do you hate rigor ballista is a shittier ags with a delay on hits that also hits lower theyve already said theyrr capping dark bow at ballista is crashing because its not that good and an extra percent range damage isnt going to change that it is not fair that melee gets piety while range and mage get shafted
2007scape,not_removed,melee range higher level requirement thats with the spec ballista spec wasnt even covered
2007scape,not_removed,maybe a weird comparison but its like the power from old old magic the gathering now banned in almost any usage because they make any deck better period i just cant see how its healthy to introduce stuff like that
2007scape,not_removed,i just reread what i said and youre right i said i hate rigor just those words no explanation edit thank god the dark bow will only have a max hit equivalent to that of a level boss whew wouldnt want that tier weapon to be able to hit anyone in the game just people with hp or less
2007scape,not_removed,melee range is an advantage in regular edge fight tick ags gives your opponent very little time to react ranged has an advantage sure in farcasting any kind of pure isnt getting prayer prayer is attack ranged and strength is it worth the combat levels to get prayer for more ranged attack and more ranged strengthno so most of the people getting and using this prayer will be combat mostly mains so the lower requirements arguement doesnt work since everyone combat uses melee and ranged anyway eg barrows accounts ballista spec has a delay and is not an overpowered weapon ags and gmaul dont even have delays but i dont think they are overpowered either other stuff if you dont pk why does it matter to you if prayers passes ive been waiting for mage and range to be on par with melee for awhile now melee can wear all types of armors and be effective attacking and defending from the other types but you have to be wearing mage to cast spells and range gear to be effective
2007scape,not_removed,the dark bow already hits but why dont we look at other weapons gmaul tick lvl weapon dds lvl weapon ags faster then dark bow and gets specs thats three melee weapons all better then the dark bow by an order of magnitude and you wonder why people maybe want to see range get a buff ive had enough with meleescape
2007scape,not_removed,you may misunderstand but im not on a crusade against these prayers i said i liked all of them but i felt the range strength increase might be a bit too much considering the power of the ballista itll be able to hit spec a lot of players so i was hesitant about that one and wanted more information edit id be curious as to the number of kills using ranged that were ballista and nonballista since its release also the ags was added with piety already existing ballista made to be of similar power before a rangedpiety existed in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,on what planet is that actually going to happen thats wearing like worth of maxed equipment to close to the hits youre suggesting the gmaul isnt hitting shit on a main account compared to ags thats comparing absolutely maxed out melee gear and risk out the ass to void range and a ballista and maybe the amulet which also gives bonus accuracy which makes it more accurate ive never said rigour is the apocalypse and maybe its not even bad but the ballista is going to an assload of people with it
2007scape,not_removed,the ballista can hit low slow as fuck that is not even in the same tier as ags which is stronger faster has specs and is more accurate you say g maul is inaccurate on mains have you ever even used a dark bow is extremely common what about dds why is it ok for melee to have a dagger speed weapon that can hit that also poisons and costs but if range has a slower two handed more expensive version that has one spec that is bad
2007scape,not_removed,fair point on the darkbow being inaccurate but the calculator im using checks dds spec at not not a massive difference but thats with of equipment on who the fuck switching to melee void to make it even drops it to but thats still with on you also dark bow is capped at or right now however youve convinced me actually dds has killed me more than anything else id vote yes for rigour
2007scape,not_removed,yeah some of the numbers i had were a bit off i really hope rigor ends up passing agree with you on those aura things i dont really want them in the game
2007scape,not_removed,yeah thanks for telling me though so i get my head straight on it there seems to be quite a negative reaction to those so i hope they pick up on it and ditch them
2007scape,not_removed,you know you dont need the sextant and that shit anymore right
2007scape,not_removed,thats where the soul bearer is you might need to get that first before you can do the clue there as it thinks you are looking for that
2007scape,not_removed,show the clue please
2007scape,not_removed,its in there just dig around its closer to the west stairs
2007scape,not_removed,find it here
2007scape,not_removed,i had a hotcold master clue there once
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt fuck off
2007scape,not_removed,everyone knows this they should just reset the original deadman if they have to but they might want to wait until they get the seasonals perfected so that they can implement all of the same rules at the same time i think it would be awesome to see
2007scape,not_removed,aint that the truth brother
2007scape,not_removed,just revert it to a normal member world and be done with it its been empty for months
2007scape,not_removed,no no no resetting thats dumb as fuck people have invested countless hours on training collecting rare items etc it would just not be fair to reset their accounts like that add the ge to make the world more accessible for new comers and regulars but do not reset
2007scape,not_removed,like seriously it is the only thing missing from it even ice wants to redeem it but without ge its aids
2007scape,not_removed,cause theres no ge its basicly iron man on exp with pvp
2007scape,not_removed,mate tell that to me and the other people who play and have put hours in there are plenty of normal worlds
2007scape,not_removed,remember darkscape people lost countless of hours and millions of gps they they had earned off of there you know why because the game was shit and no one played it same thing is gonna happen if they dont fix the deadman world eventually they will just delete it they have already said that adding the ge to it currently would be extremely difficult and likely not possible
2007scape,not_removed,that sounds kinda fun tbh
2007scape,not_removed,ooh player huh there are thousands of people who would use it if it was a normal world buddy
2007scape,not_removed,i think your missing the point by reverting that world your removing the people playing that worlds progress over the last year
2007scape,not_removed,i think your missing the point by reverting that world your removing the people playing that worlds progress over the last year
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt new by far
2007scape,not_removed,so what the dude does is he trades with some random guy and acts it out like he failed the scam actually doubling money he gets some attention and people try it out he doesnt actually accept the screen but just trolls about it it looks really legit and he wants you to try really hard to accept the screen fast so when he sees you actually going for it he just puts up instead like he did on the screen not sure if people know about this scam but its the first time ive seen it just thought i should share it so people dont get scammed
2007scape,not_removed,this is just a problem with rarely traded items yes the guy is scamming but will most likely never be punished for it just always be careful of people because from personal experience everybody is an asshole
2007scape,not_removed,aight yeah i have no idea just the first time i saw it
2007scape,not_removed,i wasnt aware hill giants had an intelligence rating of
2007scape,not_removed,its a money making method i wouldnt say its good if you want to make money and get xp at the same time its good just slow money but fast xp
2007scape,not_removed,idk where you see the servers dying its am est and the servers look like theyre averaging out to players each id give it a go once if you die then see where you wanna go after that i havent play dmm at all but im considering getting one of my friends and hopping on for some luls at least
2007scape,not_removed,its possible but hard unless you aim to skill and be in the tournament it will very hard to pk as many people have done dt and can simply bang you with a dds
2007scape,not_removed,wow the negativity yes its worth starting the games easier with ge
2007scape,not_removed,its worth starting if you have either a lot of time to put in or low expectations on what youre going to achieve a day delayed start is very painful because every pker will be able to trivially kill you so expect to just get suddenly cleaned out while youre doing a questlevelling and ask wtf why im lvl if you were hoping to be competitive in pvp its practically not possible because of how much of a time lead people will have on you even skilled players like boaty called it quits after they started late last season
2007scape,not_removed,do you have a large clan yes do you not have a large clan no
2007scape,not_removed,dont
2007scape,not_removed,na dont bother with it waste of time
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,i mean you got some pretty useful fire lighters though
2007scape,not_removed,what did ya do
2007scape,not_removed,what staff is that op
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt even have full gold amulet what a hack
2007scape,not_removed,and im proud to be an nmz prod where at least i know im free and i wont forget the men who died who gave that right to me and id gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today cause there aint no doubt i love this land god bless the afk but ya you can definitely train it up as high as you want having max combat just means you will have faster tasks
2007scape,not_removed,decent cash higher total level access to future slayer content seeing as its a pretty clear favorite skill among the community id expect to see more slayer updates if you dont plan on maxing out your total level then i dont see a reason to finish it up but its up to you in the end
2007scape,not_removed,except you definitely lose money doing slayer unless you are bossing and pretendinglying to yourself that you are doing slayer doing every single clue drop and get lucky never use a cannon and therefore slay for many more hours inefficiently when in the meantime you could have done something for more profit its just a huge misconception that annoys me whenever i see it yes there should be a balance of bossing thrown in unless youre a robot max efficiency player but you are going to lose so much on cannonballsscalespots food on your way to slayer so unless you are bossing every time you get dagganothshellhoundsabbysgreaterskalphites and max out of every boss task that is profitable etc you are definitely not making money take it from someone who just inexplicably did suqah tasks out of my last tasks roughly it costs basically a task doing suqah but yeah i agree with everything else you said completely definitely content behind that slayerwall sire cerberus kraken pet thermos petall pets basically and decent bosses overall and variety probably future slayer content for sure too op youre slayer level isnt even that bad really just ignore the people who call you a nmz prod because they are most likely kids who dont get laid ultimately who gives a fuck everyone is always a bitch about you can play the game how you want but that never applies to nmz prods really slayer isnt even that bad as i saidid consider a true nmz prod someone who hourd guthand his balls off and was like sub total level with anywhere from slayer that is a true nmz prod long postbut for the record i just got slayer myself ive used a fair amount of nmz i could have maxed awhile ago but i saved defense and range for doing slayer with if you are already maxed i wouldnt worry about it unless you really wanted to fight sirekrakencerberus and having nonmaxed range would give more incentive
2007scape,not_removed,let me know what you guys think
2007scape,not_removed,toxic blowpipe assume all questions sue mithril darts can you use it without using scales should i use toxic blowpipe for slayer at atm is it profitable for grinding blue dragons when charged
2007scape,not_removed,at what level should i start using trident over ibans for things like barrows dk rex etc edit ill use it straight away cheers guys
2007scape,not_removed,im wondering what the best gpxp mage training method is i currently have magic i was thinking alchemy to and then string gold amulets is this the best also i would like to start doing god wars dungeon my melee stats are atck str def hp prayer is it doable with these stats
2007scape,not_removed,okay im going on vacation for weeks but i want to merch in the mean time is there any way i can do that without having to use a pc i know you can use an app like virtual browser but its realllyyyyy gltichy and laggy
2007scape,not_removed,if i want to successfully complete the horror from the deep quest which skills should i bulk up
2007scape,not_removed,anyone know if hill giants in edgeville dungeon are relatively empty on members worlds also what is the cheapest members ranged weapon that can still put out some damage
2007scape,not_removed,can you get clue scrolls when mining in mlm
2007scape,not_removed,when i use the stab attack type on a slash weapon like a scim does it count as a stab weapon against stabweak mobs
2007scape,not_removed,what is osrs storyline in you were basically the world guardian is there a similar themes not where can i read the full lore plot
2007scape,not_removed,is runecrafting still the most profitable skill in the game
2007scape,not_removed,how long does it take to get slayer helmi from the nmz im about to get enough reward points so i can craft one is it worth it to immediately start grinding for the i
2007scape,not_removed,i got assigned spiritual creatures for slayer i have level slayer i tried to attack a spiritual ranger but it said i didnt have a high enough level what am i supposed to do
2007scape,not_removed,you go to home
2007scape,not_removed,just got members which quests should i do asap i have these stats
2007scape,not_removed,anagram clue scroll pacinng a taie any help would be great
2007scape,not_removed,if i cancel my subscription will i lose my membership i dont really want rs automatically resubbing
2007scape,not_removed,why do people who runecraft through the abyssmage of zamorak always have a pk skull does it actually do anything
2007scape,not_removed,i just started an ironman recently i have a decent amount of knowledge about the game my main is currently around total but i really have no idea where to start with this account i know questing is very important but really need help with which order of skills to train to help efficiency and also just helpful ironman tips any help is greatly appreciated
2007scape,not_removed,haha sweet thank you very much everyone this all really helps me
2007scape,not_removed,why looks the guthans chainskirt gay
2007scape,not_removed,void isnt efficient on zulrah until around level rangemage if your account is mostly going to be around bossing for profit it is worth getting higher defense for ahrims set up mystic will not be a very good setup for zulrah as you will likely barely get kill per trip
2007scape,not_removed,why do you want to keep your combat level low
2007scape,not_removed,i would recommend def for serp at zulrah which would allow longer trips and also be useful at other bosses
2007scape,not_removed,from my experience you should profit and even if you dont profit off individual tasks the xp you get id so substantially better than rune cbow i blowpiped all my tasks post range but i did not track heavily my profit vs expenses i took the time to rush my herb sack and gem bag and always carried alches though which imo makes a big difference i also did my tasks in the catacombs w the teleport unlocked which made banking very fast plus tasks like bloodvelds banshees etc are way better there once you get higher range youll make plenty of money off tasks especially off brutal drags wyverns etc
2007scape,not_removed,scales are required to fire darts sure you can if you want to do faster tasks consider slayer helm i from nmz still profitable assuming you bank the bones possibly less profitable than rune crossbow with broad bolts but faster kills
2007scape,not_removed,mithril darts are good xpgph you need scales as mentioned before i definitely recommend using the blowpipe for everything even though it is more expensive than rune crossbow you save so much time you can easily make your money back and even have some money left although dragons are the only task i dont use blowpipe at because of the antidragon shield you can run to a safespot and switch to blowpipe but im too lazy for that personally and if you use avas youll definitely make money with the bones and hides you bank
2007scape,not_removed,no you cant use it without scales blowpipe is good for faster kills than a crossbow although you lose a lot more money using scalesdarts
2007scape,not_removed,trident is always better than ibans
2007scape,not_removed,asap since trident is more dps
2007scape,not_removed,is what ive read on this sub edit this is what im referencing guys
2007scape,not_removed,stringing amulets is more expensive than bursting atm
2007scape,not_removed,amulets is bad xpgp since there are profitable methods that you have access to by then eg tan leather you would probably be able to get a kill most of the time solo but wouldnt be good money
2007scape,not_removed,for gwd its recommended to have over in your combat stats if you want to last long especially in a group you can attempt and kill some of the bosses by yourself but if youve never done gwd id recommend getting a few more levels mainly in attack and strength so that youll have a much easier time learning
2007scape,not_removed,magic is always going to be expensive or slow to train you can do alching or magic imbue whilst doing other skills agility alching works well since you can train those spells without slowing down your other skills as for gwd the higher the stats the better but your current stats would be ok for bandoszamorak attacker assuming you have the gear higher magic will help at bandos
2007scape,not_removed,nah all you have to do is pick two or three things that consistently move up and down by percent a good option is snapdragon seeds because those flow between and every few daysweeks pick something that there will always be demand for or something sitting slightly above alch value and throw a few mil into a few different things its important that you diversify and dont throw your bank into one item also try and see if you can consistently buy an item for less than the ge average with an hour or two if you can find an item like that then just put in an offer for a bunch and let it sit once you come back sell them all for a decent margin
2007scape,not_removed,the final boss requires styles magic elemental attacks range and melee consider training magic so you can use all of the elemental wave spells
2007scape,not_removed,i did this quest at like combat all you need is fire bolt and a few monkfish
2007scape,not_removed,for the most part they arent a good money maker by member standards bonecross bow is pretty cheap to buy and use
2007scape,not_removed,they are relatively empty because there are a ton of other methods that are better for training in members
2007scape,not_removed,no clue geodes cannot be obtained while mining at the motherlode mine
2007scape,not_removed,a huge number of quests either require melee stats or ranged levels or give melee or ranged xp upon completion itd be best for you to look up a list on google or the wiki as i have no idea which quests youd consider importantfun
2007scape,not_removed,as long as mage is higher than or equal to range mage× is higher than attstr they wont influent your combat level so if youre mage your attack and strength can be a combined total of for example and your range can be too i dont know what level range you want to pk at but id say at mage it can get really powerful with barrage at that level you wont really be limited by quest reqs depending on your defence level
2007scape,not_removed,it does but the scimitar has a higher slash attack bonus than stab which typically makes it less effective to switch to the stab style on a scimitar
2007scape,not_removed,the lore is about the same as it was in in most people dont seem to care about it so its not really been expanded upon since osrss release only a few big new updates like zeah and have included lore tweaks
2007scape,not_removed,yes double natures are still the best
2007scape,not_removed,in my opinion yes its worth getting immediately but it can wait if youre never going to use ranged or magic for slayer it takes hours to collect the points could be a bit longer if youre a low combat level
2007scape,not_removed,if you plan on rangingmaging tasks
2007scape,not_removed,definitely altough if you plan on getting both the archers ring and slayer helm imbued id recommend doing the ring first because of the dps increase at range with blowpipe i get about points per hour
2007scape,not_removed,yes you can you obviously will not be able to equip it though this works with other defenders as well you could have defence and get adamant defenders but dont have the ability to equip them
2007scape,not_removed,i suspect you had your stats drained by the route to god wars bring a super restore to get your slayer back to or just wait for it to restore on its own
2007scape,not_removed,most people prefer the safer and more relaxing quest cape route as for speed the two are quite close so you should time your runs to see which is faster if speeds most important to you
2007scape,not_removed,all of the ones you have the requirements for really id suggest first getting your prayer to using someones gilded altar can be easily found in world yanille or rimmington house portals for the xp multiplier it provides some important quests to get you started druidic ritual unlocks the herblore skill tree gnome village unlocks spirit tree transportation the grand tree unlocks gnome glider transportation monkey madness unlocks the ability to wield the dragon scimitar the fremennik trials unlocks the ability to wear the berserker helm fairy tale part i prerequisite for ftp ii below fairy tale part ii stat requirements not needed unlocks fairy ring transportation eventually recipe for disaster and its many prerequisites lots of xp rewards unlocks armored gloves which are bestinslot that should get you started really you should end up doing almost every quest as they all provide some benefit plus the quest point cape has a highly useful teleport to the legends guild
2007scape,not_removed,captain ginea in the shayzien area of zeah
2007scape,not_removed,no you can pay and cancel immediately afterwards youll still have the month of membership that you paid for credited to your account
2007scape,not_removed,entering the abyss gives you a skull and drains your prayer
2007scape,not_removed,this is the best ironman guide made by our lord and saviour oziris it basically lists what you need to do all the way to max and several ironman have used this
2007scape,not_removed,as a general thing diaries and quests help a lot by unlocking gear and daily tasks like bstaffs from zaff pure essence in ardy and bonemeal from robin all worth using implings are incredibly useful its not a bad idea to go straight to red chins and get hunter get magic for snare spell and go to puro puro implings can get you tons of alchables quest items seeds herbs and gear including a rune scim so dont bother camping fire giants
2007scape,not_removed,if by gay you mean functional and comfortable hell yeah no more reason needed
2007scape,not_removed,more specifically void mage is never efficient compared to max mage attack void range is best high level dps
2007scape,not_removed,hey thanks for the reply did you used mithril darts
2007scape,not_removed,thats void
2007scape,not_removed,you can beat that boss with melee range mage you need the mage for the blast spells but you could probably do with just water blast bring a rune scimmybrine sabre and best arrows you can then runes for all spells
2007scape,not_removed,so if i am using it against a stabweak mob it makes more sense to use the slash attack instead because youre getting a better bonus anyway
2007scape,not_removed,i said screw it and blocked the task
2007scape,not_removed,thank you
2007scape,not_removed,oh thank you that makes sense now
2007scape,not_removed,thanks bro
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,pretty much yes the dragon scimitars stab bonus is quite low
2007scape,not_removed,it would be even better to swap to a stab weapon leafbladed sword for example
2007scape,not_removed,youre reading a post from years ago
2007scape,not_removed,how does that make a difference serious question has there been updates to these items since then
2007scape,not_removed,trident has always been better yes before magic ibans staff would deal more damage at max hit however the trident is tick faster seconds than ibans staff this causes the trident to be much better in dps than ibans i believe it is slightly higher even at magic although i cant find the post that proves this
2007scape,not_removed,if youre talking about the tourney its based off regular rates or what the seasonal and main i use the term main loosely server are
2007scape,not_removed,i just mined sulphuric and made dynamite pretty afk
2007scape,not_removed,its not that bad tbh making dynamite will take you about three hours for full favour if you want it quicker make the armour very fast favour for someone with high smithing
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the tip i just made dynamite and got to kind of hoping the higher level amours will be significantly faster than that process though
2007scape,not_removed,thats true its just so tedious not worth the effort imo
2007scape,not_removed,ive heard that the highesttier armour is faster than dynamite
2007scape,not_removed,yeah just realized how much of that special ore you need to get though ill be doing the sulphur to now this is my least favourite favor by far
2007scape,not_removed,now learn how to screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqhowtotakeascreenshot
2007scape,not_removed,two days two front page posts from people taking a cellphone picture of their screen come on guys were better than this
2007scape,not_removed,u boosted animal
2007scape,not_removed,that was the boosted part of this post was it not
2007scape,not_removed,id support this only if your account was years or older
2007scape,not_removed,i feel like this guy just learned about life and wants it implemented into the game
2007scape,not_removed,so youre saying that youd have to pay it into a savings bank account and it would only get released monthly as membership renews or are you just saying they should give out free money because the latter shouldnt happen
2007scape,not_removed,there is no cost of living in runescape so this would be pointless
2007scape,not_removed,just what
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,wrong prayer pots sharks cannonballs i cannot live in gilenor without these
2007scape,not_removed,you can still play runescape without those items eg literally every
2007scape,not_removed,alright guide a bit low energy and dull also no idea what it is exactly but the resolution of your game window recording is really uncomfortable to look at everything looks skewed
2007scape,not_removed,very good guide thank you but i got assigned to kill a monsters called ankou does this mean i can not wont get slayer x
2007scape,not_removed,perfect guide thanks
2007scape,not_removed,this really made me realize how little i am doing with my life when playing runescape
2007scape,not_removed,very nice will recommend to all my frieds
2007scape,not_removed,hahaa
2007scape,not_removed,this is like a less retarded version of those ece emery videos
2007scape,not_removed,ill keep that in mind
2007scape,not_removed,simply do this but go over to the ankou i can post a guide if you need help
2007scape,not_removed,only
2007scape,not_removed,its not little when you get paid to play i dont but some people do
2007scape,not_removed,i appreciate a guides would help a lot much thank jon
2007scape,not_removed,cant get any better than that sir
2007scape,not_removed,ill put what i wrote to you in a previous post here to maybe add a bit more discussion i do think it would be too powerful having the stats of an actual skill cape though maybe more along the lines of in every defensive stat with a cost of like i dunno we wouldnt want it to butt heads with the actual defence of a skill cape or a cape of legends or an obsidian cape we also wouldnt want the yew location making the members woodcutting guild too redundant for yews perhaps maybe maple trees since maple logs are but no maple trees exist in any areas
2007scape,not_removed,i am of the opinion that none of these features should be better than methods so how inefficient should these spots be
2007scape,not_removed,instead of yew trees i would add a few maple trees to the guild why because imo there shouldnt be a priffdinas of any form in osrs no matter of or not and keep on thinking if this area is supposed to be good to use it will be overpopulated probably worse for everyone as you would always wait for respawn times
2007scape,not_removed,well most will cut teaks so maple logs wont really have a difference on also it wont make it faster since dragon axe isnt a thing in the only thing that may be better is the hill giants and the fishing most people dont kill them as a main and most really dont fish lobsters or swordies past
2007scape,not_removed,i do think that this is a good idea i will definitely consider it
2007scape,not_removed,its not necessarily the fact that there is better xp rates in but i personally dont want this spot to be a faster gathering spot for those resources than existing spots there is like what quests i would argue that ardy cape takes more time to achieeve than this quest cape and with such low requirements its not that unlikely for botters to complete the quests to get access to this areaa if it is actually quite good
2007scape,not_removed,why
2007scape,not_removed,youve pretty much just copy and pasted this from the imgur link that was circling a few days ago
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,way too many prayers wtf just add like a couple new ones and youll scrape in the karma
2007scape,not_removed,i dont wanna have to be looking at diff prays when im tryna switch it as fast as i can
2007scape,not_removed,just dont move the position of any of the current overheadsult streagle eye and ill be happy
2007scape,not_removed,and how would that be possible with the addition of low and high lvl prays e also i think piety would be head and shoulders above ult str priorityusage wise
2007scape,not_removed,im still dry
2007scape,not_removed,you need it for music cape which has a nice hood
2007scape,not_removed,b l u d g e o n
2007scape,not_removed,there kinda is it is the abyssal bludgeon and abyssal dagger
2007scape,not_removed,neck it
2007scape,not_removed,no there are other weapons you can use sara sword is a good alternative for strength but for real though why are you training strength without dharoks at nmz
2007scape,not_removed,there are two weapons created for that purpose
2007scape,not_removed,never seen so much cringe in post
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,yo yall can sniff my ass those suckᕙ⇀‸↼‶ᕗ
2007scape,not_removed,i hope you get ddosd ▰˘◡˘▰
2007scape,not_removed,been there for over a year and a half
2007scape,not_removed,bots are a part of the game if you dont want to deal with them find locations that they cant go to edit they arent a part of the game but jagex does not have the time or money to deal with all of them so players just need to work around them
2007scape,not_removed,looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck you bruhtherin ps quest cape is already op
2007scape,not_removed,no void is overpowered enough all your going to do is make armadyl crash
2007scape,not_removed,lol bait
2007scape,not_removed,how about an option at pest control whereby for tickets you can add something onto your slayer helm that allows the full void affect
2007scape,not_removed,has to be bait
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,how last i checked it gave no stats at all
2007scape,not_removed,that would work just as well
2007scape,not_removed,quest cape to all defence and pray when trimmed plus unlimited teleports to legends guild which is the closest tele to a fairy ring
2007scape,not_removed,support literally uses these arrows
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt that make rune arrows bunch cheaper atm broad arrowsboltsaddy
2007scape,not_removed,honestly id rather have broad bolts nerfed most people dont even use them for their true purpose the stats are obviously too high or the price is too cheap
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i agree i always thought it was kind of dumb they dont match addy arrows honestly though they should just buff all arrows and maybe slightly decrease the ranged str on broad bolts im all for variety in weapons but i feel like we should have at least one bow that is viable right now arrows even with sec attack speeds are awful if they were to add a new ranged weapon that actually used standard arrows theyd have to put so much ranged str on the weapon itself because of this why not just increase all arrows strength or at least mithrune by like maybe itd make using something other than a rcb more viable for slayer tasks for low and mid lvls that cant use a blowpipe yet
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think theres any reason not to
2007scape,not_removed,nope man broad bolts addy bolts but broad arrows are about the same as mith arrows and definitely worse than addy
2007scape,not_removed,like of people use them for slayer what is their true purpose if not that
2007scape,not_removed,fishing guild is better some of those goblins dont drop it
2007scape,not_removed,this would allow teams to easily target players and lure them by letting them think theyre in their team
2007scape,not_removed,make it so you cant attack teammates then
2007scape,not_removed,only able to unteam in the safe area at ge preventing this from being abused doesnt solve the issue of scouts
2007scape,not_removed,what issue with scouts
2007scape,not_removed,someone could have a scout in your group this know where youre team is thus you die either way
2007scape,not_removed,like that cant happen already sounds like a dumb excuse to not help new players find teams
2007scape,not_removed,im literally saying if better clans teams were to go to the board put a scout in your group and then you all go pking youre dead as soon as you skull its a good idea with flaws why not improve your social skills and attempt to make a team with random other people you calling it a dumb excuse is literally the same as me saying youre being lazy go make friends in game
2007scape,not_removed,might be reposting but my initial post isnt showing up its harder for a scout to infiltrate a group of friends or people actually playing the game and grouping up together than it is to click on a board and join up with random people you dont know sounds like a good idea but would be abused as bad as boxing is currently saying its a dumb excuse to help players leads me to believe that you cant find a team in game or make friends in game sorry if thats rude but im pointing out a flaw if you actually take time to think about youre idea youre either being too lazy to find a team or socially inept because i told you that people would join these groups to scout you got offended its way harder for a scout to join an already formed group or group looking to get together than it is to just click on a board instantly get in a group thats trying to randomly form with people you dont know one of you says lets go barb village and now youre all instantly dead sorry great idea but it will probably be more demoralizing for newer players
2007scape,not_removed,i was in the biggest pking team for the first deadman seasons wtf you talking about improve social skills fucking reddit neckbeards
2007scape,not_removed,same i dont see the point of your op
2007scape,not_removed,what we really need is a way to stop the nice meme
2007scape,not_removed,just create an ironman instead
2007scape,not_removed,self control
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,it has more players than its not going anywhere
2007scape,not_removed,i hope they bring out or something similar ahah just my own hope the wilderness is getting worse and worse it was fine before
2007scape,not_removed,what the wilderness is populated enough atm its just full of shit crap like ballistas and venom that doesnt belong in the game was just a distant wish either that or get a j mod that knows something about pking
2007scape,not_removed,whew wipes sweat off forhead good thanks
2007scape,not_removed,magically putting it to wont make the wilderness come alive it wont happen why split up the community anymore
2007scape,not_removed,cmon dude why u gotta do that rp shit
2007scape,not_removed,get off reddit immediately
2007scape,not_removed,holy shit very good shit here bro
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,me gusta
2007scape,not_removed,youre not funny
2007scape,not_removed,youre not funny
2007scape,not_removed,all i see is three liars and a rot economist
2007scape,not_removed,ye s
2007scape,not_removed,k
2007scape,not_removed,is he really going through the wild risking his bcp and potential ring
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt kbd
2007scape,not_removed,its not a huge risk just log if you see a white dot
2007scape,not_removed,pretty big risk to take if you are a tick too slow considering he probably used the wild portals to get to kbd as well he couldve been jumped on if thrown to any multi portal especially rogue castle
2007scape,not_removed,thats why i just walk there if you dont think you can logout quickly dont do it i suppose but i like having bis everywhere
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt kbd
2007scape,not_removed,play it to the video he has way back in where he kills jad on prayer and no weaponsarmorfood edit video for anyeone interested
2007scape,not_removed,this sucked
2007scape,not_removed,make it great then
2007scape,not_removed,if you are going to take the time to post you might as well say what the exploit or scam is
2007scape,not_removed,how doesent it show inventory and other preventive shit still fucked up they scammed you sorry sucks the new system is worst
2007scape,not_removed,scammed twice first guy managed to eat food during the fight and the second guy manage to equip his dfs im an idiot maybe its because the new interface why i didnt see when the settings were adjusted before the fights started but anyways this is more of a warning to pay attention to the settings if youre going to the duel arena
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think anyone cares tbh definitely not frowned upon considering half the players are jobless to begin with
2007scape,not_removed,i think most people would be proud of you for that lol
2007scape,not_removed,just make sure you dont lose your job over an online game put the things that matter first and if you can then there is not a problem
2007scape,not_removed,the word is envious isnt it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah no doubt i never play with chat on for that reason always something i can afk if a client pops up for that reason

2007scape,not_removed,more than you would think surprisingly
2007scape,not_removed,if youre under wild you will keep them if youre above you will lose them they disappear you cant go pick them up
2007scape,not_removed,sounds fair thanks

2007scape,not_removed,who the fucc is that
2007scape,not_removed,absolutely i dont play runescape anymore havent since my childhood kind of a shame im unable to vote for him for best runescape content creator just because i dont play anymore
2007scape,not_removed,yah i logged into my account just to vote for him hes just a normal guy like the rest of us so i think thats why we wanna lift him and carry him on our shoulders if we can help this one guy it makes us feel better inside because that could be us thats just my p
2007scape,not_removed,i think the mods are using the google poll vote with that instead
2007scape,not_removed,normal as opposed to what i dont really understand what you mean by that
2007scape,not_removed,ice is weird as fuck but hes a very entertaining streamer

2007scape,not_removed,thieving for example
2007scape,not_removed,i killed green drags using a looting bag kept full inv of food and a few sara brews when looting bag was full i banked at clan wars with ring of duelling ran through the ffa portal to replenish stats tele to corp beast with games necklace ran east back to green drags looting bag is full after kills and kills is worth k i can do about sometimes trips an hour if i take regular combat potions like gp each once i made i bought a whip and super combat potions and super restores i quested out proselyte and now i do slayer only slayer is semi fun and starts becoming good profit when you hit combat level one more thing i always banked after dragon kills getting greedy and emptying my inv of food for more dragon bones and hides ussually led to me being pked welfare gear is totally feasible at green drags rune plate dragin chain skirt rune gloves d scim addy full helm climbing boots
2007scape,not_removed,not sure there are any dmm only clans that are actually good
2007scape,not_removed,i like how you incorporated the crossbow limb design amazing
2007scape,not_removed,monni ornament kit
2007scape,not_removed,the special attack on this may get a bit sticky
2007scape,not_removed,looks like a penis to me
2007scape,not_removed,͡ಠ ͜ʖಠ
2007scape,not_removed,low key a handle like the dragon defender would actually be sick on the real thing
2007scape,not_removed,why would you put a crossbow limb on a sword
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think this is a good design
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,why
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure how disney would feel about this
2007scape,not_removed,the bosses available are only those that everyone in the party has access to if this is less than bosses the party will not be allowed to enter you need at least bosses of overlap with the other person
2007scape,not_removed,got same problem mate i get like long bones every fking day some day got curved bones and mystic robe tops and all that shit ive been bossing whole i mean not every day but still i got no sara hilt drop always someone else got it acb seen best i seen at bandos was hilt at zammy like kc i got enough lantadyme for this winter spear hilt sotd or steam bstaffs in kc abyss i managed to get whips and a head wyvern never dropped me visage dont ask my kc ia too high there only luck i got is at frikking kraken with stupid tentacles but i try to be optimistic im nearly maxed and i only stick to zulrah as i reckon my account has jinxed rng in godwarsother bosses btw happy and i hope we get some better rng in that year
2007scape,not_removed,its too rare to consistently teleport to zulandra yourself that was the point the tele nerf
2007scape,not_removed,or get agility so prices of items dont go haywire again
2007scape,not_removed,nah its good as it is you can get multiple kills per teleport which makes up the cost one youre good at it just save up and work on construction or just use fairy rings with agility or and pied if you get a quest point cape you get teleported to legends good which is right by a fairy ring id recommend guides for quests way faster than wiki or runehq these are good goals to set and grinding zulrah is consistent cash as is
2007scape,not_removed,make zulrah even more op thinking
2007scape,not_removed,just get fairy ring into ur house and agility
2007scape,not_removed,it was which they nerfed to then it was still too op so they nerfed to not drop one every kill and now you are asked for a buff to the highest gphr money making method yeah no
2007scape,not_removed,u obviously dont tho
2007scape,not_removed,thankfully i just completed monkey madness and it dced server wide
2007scape,not_removed,these superiors look great
2007scape,not_removed,selling gaze
2007scape,not_removed,a true inspiration to us all
2007scape,not_removed,wot
2007scape,not_removed,the movie trailer
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,looks awesome just not sure whats going on with the shield seems to be attached on his elbow
2007scape,not_removed,thats really cool makes me wish i could draw
2007scape,not_removed,appreciate all the comments glad i could make something interesting for the osrs community
2007scape,not_removed,well since everyone here is either quite ignorant or rude for no reason ill try and give you some actual constructive feedback first of all i really like the colors you took the darkred of jad and made it something a lot more interesting while keeping his look and feel which is both really hard and makes for an awesome representation however there is quite a bit to note when looking at the drawing and its construction both jad and the character look very flat and very stiff not to mention the way you placed the obby shield which is as if you stuck it on there despite it being a video game character perspective anatomy and gestures still apply i recommend you look up something called dynamic poses and gesture drawing to fix the obby shield you should really think about what its shape is in and how you can manipulate it in space and then how to represent that on a canvas think about where his arm is and think about how he holds the shield the same applies to the rest of the character and jads head it applies to everything really think of everything in terms of basic objects boxes cylinders etc for jad his head and face seem a bit off because the right side of his face is drawn longer than the left side however in this slightly tilted viewing angle you should actually be able to see more of his left side than his right side you can accomplish this not by stretching out one side but but again by thinking about the shape and form of his face the way his shoulders go outside the canvas give the impression that he is rather out of proportion more than the original model suggests next off while the colors are really good there is little to no use of a light source and values in general for values you should ask yourself what light sources do i have what parts of the drawing should be the darkest and what parts should be the lightest values allow you to see the forms for what they are the only place that i can see some use of values are around his eyes and the left armpit you can say his eyes the fireball the ground are all light sources but you would imagine that the fire ball is the most prominent one so use it the underside of jad should be way darker shadow the righttop side of the helmet should be the lightest highlight and so on in general i think you should really focus on drawing correctly before moving on to the stylization of the drawing while coloring is fun its unfortunate to spend a whole lot of time on stylizing a drawing when the foundation is off some books that i can recommend are perspective made easy by ernest norling and figure drawing books by andrew loomis glen vilppu and michael hampton in any case keep doing what youre doing and thanks for drawing something osrs related a lot of people seem to enjoy it
2007scape,not_removed,haha these comments you cant please everyone looks awesome man would love to see more
2007scape,not_removed,seeing how many talented osrs players there are on this sub makes me feel like a piece of shit d nice drawing
2007scape,not_removed,epic
2007scape,not_removed,why this dood got some pizzas on his back fam
2007scape,not_removed,i get an onepunch man vibe off of this

2007scape,not_removed,really good color work
2007scape,not_removed,shoulda went in with the blowpipe on the real tho sick drawing
2007scape,not_removed,ive come to bargain
2007scape,not_removed,jade
2007scape,not_removed,jad looks like he was drawn in mind with being put into doom seriously its demonicly creepy this is a good thing
2007scape,not_removed,jade
2007scape,not_removed,great art love seeing stuff like this keep doing more
2007scape,not_removed,that is one scary jad i always say i would wanna live in the rs world but this is
2007scape,not_removed,does jad have a precious ribbon
2007scape,not_removed,make more of these
2007scape,not_removed,this is amazing op
2007scape,not_removed,good stuff dude cant wait to see more of what you make
2007scape,not_removed,big mistake the character is making jad is actually holding a angry horny position which means that he may pull down his pants and reveal his massive tzhaar cock at any moment now
2007scape,not_removed,terrifyingly stunning
2007scape,not_removed,i like it besides the shield should have went oldschool and done a karils xbow
2007scape,not_removed,interesting way to wear a shield
2007scape,not_removed,hahaa
2007scape,not_removed,dj khaled
2007scape,not_removed,ft dj tztokhaled
2007scape,not_removed,good point probably shouldve lowered it a bit on his arm the point was to make it look like he was deflecting jads fireball
2007scape,not_removed,think hes using an sgs too hacker
2007scape,not_removed,not to mention its in his right hand
2007scape,not_removed,keep it up id much rather see this than the same memes repeated for a month
2007scape,not_removed,well done man really amazing
2007scape,not_removed,wow really amazing critique you made some fair points that i can take note of moving forward thanks for taking the time to do that and for recommending those books
2007scape,not_removed,fucking what a good comment this is actual constructive criticism for the op to go away and further his craft without being malicious or making the op feel like shit nice
2007scape,not_removed,because pizza is tasty fam
2007scape,not_removed,karils top homie
2007scape,not_removed,your drawing was heaps better
2007scape,not_removed,l m a o
2007scape,not_removed,its still great original content thank you for sharing
2007scape,not_removed,this is really cool would love to see more runescape stuff
2007scape,not_removed,should have been a odium ward for realism
2007scape,not_removed,could be vannaka
2007scape,not_removed,dude could be a lefty
2007scape,not_removed,the photo may have been taken from a mirrors reflection
2007scape,not_removed,check out the forums under os clans
2007scape,not_removed,its the only way some of us know when its the weekend
2007scape,not_removed,do these ones start talking about random crap too
2007scape,not_removed,its the weekend
2007scape,not_removed,cos they are really hurting my hunter xp too
2007scape,not_removed,the unfortunate truth is that the game gets flooded with bots on the weekend because the mods arent able to do anything about it until monday
2007scape,not_removed,hunter is the usually the most favorite skill people like to bot for cash and the weekend is when they create more from lvl and suicide bot them till they get banned
2007scape,not_removed,mod weath runs his bots there
2007scape,not_removed,summer holiday and the weekend i spent most of last night doing agility and there was a guy stood in the same spot without logging for about hours looked him up and hes got low stats with woodcutting hopefully he will be a part of the cleanup mondaywhenever they do their mass bot ban
2007scape,not_removed,weekend bot fest gl at black chins too pkers are out at all hours on weekends
2007scape,not_removed,is this the case even for total level worlds
2007scape,not_removed,its weekend bots always mass bot everything on weekends why because its the weekend and mod weath does not work on weekends
2007scape,not_removed,its the reason why all of my stats are except hunter tbh
2007scape,not_removed,started an ironman days ago and im looking around like am i the only real player here new skill should be bot banning
2007scape,not_removed,not to mention the white berry bots at lava dragons literally on every world
2007scape,not_removed,do west province hard diary dont complain
2007scape,not_removed,people talking about mods not being there on the weekend they cant hire someone to ban bots on the weekend
2007scape,not_removed,botsdeservehunterxptoo
2007scape,not_removed,downvoted fuck ironmen
2007scape,not_removed,do your western hards plebs
2007scape,not_removed,red chins arent worth doing anyways even if no one was there just get hunter and do black chins bring an imp box and bank your black chinchompas at wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,weath being lazy
2007scape,not_removed,please mods do something its unplayable
2007scape,not_removed,yes lol
2007scape,not_removed,as a former bot developer and former and current rsps developer i will never understand why fellow developers think auto responses is a good idea i almost think developers put it in their free version so they can charge for a paid version with it off thats the only reason i can think of why a bot would have that its literally like waving a big flag that says ban me
2007scape,not_removed,what do you want them to do pay money for a game and sit there with a thumb up their ass as jagex does nothing
2007scape,not_removed,they cant use their jagex account at home
2007scape,not_removed,not really but lots of people play on total worlds to avoid bots and there arent that many total worlds so the popular training spots are usually full
2007scape,not_removed,catching chins is one of the best moneymakers to start up an account so people who want to do that get hurt a lot
2007scape,not_removed,they have automated processes that ban them
2007scape,not_removed,ever heard of different account builds you dumb shit
2007scape,not_removed,i would do that but im one of the few ultimate ironmen that isnt a viable option for me
2007scape,not_removed,more down to preference i liked to zone out and watch movies while i did my hunter in the end i was still getting xp an hour and could do chins without having to bank whenever i did black chins pkers were just too annoying for my liking
2007scape,not_removed,i think they found a loophole on the auto detection system these accounts are throwaways only intended to exist through the weekend id assume manual reports by players dont get looked at until monday so they dont give a damn auto chatting keeps their accounts able to suicide bot for the whole weekend
2007scape,not_removed,jagex does do something these bots are banned every week they are just incredibly easy to start up again if you have a magical solution that would permanently stop botting everyone would love to hear it
2007scape,not_removed,you forgot about the shitty servers too
2007scape,not_removed,i just play the game instead
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt you be pissed if your work called you and told you that you had to work from home every weekend
2007scape,not_removed,no it isnt gphour isnt even that much doing red chins quicker to do runecrafting not to mention you profit way more if youre still adamant red chins are what starters should be doing red chins without hunter are slow as fuck maybe an hour assuming you get hunter you can do black chinchompas and make way more money get faster exp rates if you are hunter youre able to pot to dragon implings which are even better money irrelevant argument thread only people who should be doing red chinchompas are players who have completed west province hard want decent exp
2007scape,not_removed,high doubts very high doubts considering ash once made a statement on twitter somewhere as theres a reason they have weath and people to ban bots
2007scape,not_removed,y u so mad you chose to limit yourself
2007scape,not_removed,ever heard of not being a fucking noob loser
2007scape,not_removed,pkers are what makes black chin hunting thrilling
2007scape,not_removed,auto chatting keeps their accounts able to suicide bot for the whole weekend except it honestly doesnt auto chattingauto responding literally is just waving a big red flag it will never prevent bans in any way the reason this is true is because even something with as sophsiticated of an ai like cleverbot you can still easily tell it is a bot
2007scape,not_removed,a couple of suggestions a two way handshake between the client and the server to verify the clients authenticity might have some issues with those of you using osbuddy process iteration to check for signature functions loaded into memory a few of the botting applications and user made scripts are open sourced so it should be easy to although i think java might not have the ability to do that as it runs in a vm im sure there are other creative ways to detect too
2007scape,not_removed,say theyre afk skilling on their normal account whats to stop them logging in the jagex account and banning the high skill levelled ones
2007scape,not_removed,hunting makes me an hour with hunting at the normal red chin area black chins are bullshit theoratically you could make an hour there but you cant go minutes without getting fucked by an pker so realisticly thats like idk about dragon implings tho but doing that gives almost no xp so theres that
2007scape,not_removed,i spent hours hunting d imps on my ironman got dbolts and dragonstone amulets which translates to about loot i must be doing something wrong im pretty sure i earn way doing red chins for hours
2007scape,not_removed,red chins at lvl should atleast be an hour im getting about chinsh at lvl in the private area which equates to approx i cant see how doing them normally outside would be less than if you have a spot to yourself
2007scape,not_removed,bans are at least partially automated as they are still banned on weekends quite often member bans seem to almost always require a mod check as the bans are almost always delayed until monday
2007scape,not_removed,ease up little guy we cant all spend our lives grinding fucking achievement diaries lel
2007scape,not_removed,auto chat is only obvious bot activity to users not auto detection its pretty clear this is true why because you dont say somebody is wrong when what their doing is working the goldfarmers running these accounts always have dozens accounts every weekend its pretty clear they would stop or change up how they bot if it didnt work
2007scape,not_removed,i may be incorrect but i dont think jagex bans bots on the weekends since theyre off work so the autochat is just to keep the automatic botting bans away before the weekend is over
2007scape,not_removed,might have some issues with those of you using osbuddy more people use party clients than dont anything that would interfere with them like that would be very bad for the game especially with the unusable state the official client is in a few of the botting applications and user made scripts are open sourced so it should be easy to although i think java might not have the ability to do that as it runs in a vm most of the open source bots get banned pretty quickly a few manage to stay around but most get banned its the private scripts that stay around a lot longer the mods dont just hang around and chill at red chins until they find a bot and ban him weath bans hundreds of thousands of accounts they do have a system in place to catch most bots however banning accounts on the weekend is a bad idea because a false ban couldnt be reverted and outright removing the ability to bot is unfeasible every game with resources and an economy will be botted its just how mmos work
2007scape,not_removed,or they dont play rs at all on the weekends
2007scape,not_removed,they cant just ban people because they look and act like a bot they have to use whatever checks they have at the office
2007scape,not_removed,hes saying if you were to sell the d imps
2007scape,not_removed,unopened d imp is like
2007scape,not_removed,i dont understand why youd be doing red chins outside the area because its literally not worth it any way possible
2007scape,not_removed,you are right i realized that and posted here
2007scape,not_removed,oh that actually makes sense i didnt think their auto ban would go based off of chat im too used to how rsps work and ive been out of the botting scene for a very long time
2007scape,not_removed,they have botwatch though
2007scape,not_removed,ive used the official client since release whats so unusable about it
2007scape,not_removed,more people use party clients than dont anything that would interfere with them like that would be very bad for the game especially with the unusable state the official client is in theyve said otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,bro youre totally right people shouldnt do that stupid bullshit because you totally told them not to and youre right and theyre wrong god i hate when people want to play the game the way they want bots arent even a problem to the game if you play it effectively like this genius fucking idiots definitely dont ruin training spots and the games economy 👌
2007scape,not_removed,yeah as a former better this is what i did spend a day getting the level on the bot account that i needed then on the weekend suicide tell jagex is back to work trade to a mule then trade to main mule then trade to my main it worked for quite a few years i dont know how long the bots would last cause i just made new accounts every week no longer do it though because once i gained some respect for the game i decided to quit and i ended up getting that account bannedp
2007scape,not_removed,it straight up does not work for more than half the people using osx
2007scape,not_removed,the many simple features that should be in the main client that are not most are qol stuff map orb that opens in window boosted stats timer and current stats overlay item name overlay for dropped items a massive bunch of specific overlays for activities that are helpful its the kind of stuff that addons in wow and other mmos used to do things that you didnt realize should be in the default client until you use it
2007scape,not_removed,half the playerbase are too stupid to know that draynor is west of lumbridge so need a map in game to hold their hand
2007scape,not_removed,probably because theyre counting the bots as people that use a regular client
2007scape,not_removed,considering its not efficient exp not efficient money have you tried catching red chins before level and seen how slow they are
2007scape,not_removed,eh qol is a far cry from unusable for me the map orb is pointless and the stats and item overlays are downright obnoxious the stats timer is the only one id use and rarely at that i dont mind people using clients like osbuddy or runeloader but i actually prefer the standard client for the most part
2007scape,not_removed,is osbuddy less cpu intensive than the official client i feel like my laptop shouldnt be getting so hot to play osrs in a fixed window then again i only have an processor
2007scape,not_removed,maybe i just remember them mentioning the amount of people who actually use osbuddy is smaller than the regular client
2007scape,not_removed,im level at the moment and i just do it because its relaxing simple and i make money doing it
2007scape,not_removed,the majority are highly customizable show an overlay for item drops above a price threshhold ect you can choose whatever addons you want and how you want them to work
2007scape,not_removed,the beauty of it is if you dont like it you can turn it off it would be nice if the official client could support those features too but dev time
2007scape,not_removed,no osb and i think most third party clients in general is more cpu intensive than the original client
2007scape,not_removed,the osbuddy client shows the number of people logged in on their client and it is almost always over of the current players online
2007scape,not_removed,if you really meant no xp waste you would afk finals
2007scape,not_removed,fishing also do herb runs
2007scape,not_removed,personally id get those really low lvls u have up so i could enter the total worlds tbh ur stats baffle me i dont see how u can have such highs levels in some hard to train skills yet easy ones so low
2007scape,not_removed,ive been afking monkfish since hcim came out made over so far so its not too bad if you want to make money at the same time
2007scape,not_removed,rc
2007scape,not_removed,hunter at green or yellow lizards youll have before you know it
2007scape,not_removed,range w full arma dfs broads etc input per minutes bandits how i got my range
2007scape,not_removed,higher magic level is amazing for zulrah and zulrah is lyfe so afk in nmz with fire wave decent melee armour without destroying your magic attack normal hard mode with a rock cake and super magic potions you should average mage exp an hour and only have to come back every minutes make sure you have smoke battlestaff occult and tormented bracelet though

2007scape,not_removed,fuck son
2007scape,not_removed,just clicking the stream title wont endanger anything right
2007scape,not_removed,no only the runescape forums link
2007scape,not_removed,him socking dw in the face was more exciting than rocky beating the russian
2007scape,not_removed,anyone looking for more arthur memes should visit rblackpeopletwitter
2007scape,not_removed,okay
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,how about we rewrite the post with proper capitalisation punctuation and real words
2007scape,not_removed,it looks fine to me
2007scape,not_removed,i vote it gets the dragon hunter crossbow treatment and the circle thing in the front is replaced with an eagle head no other change lets keep it simple
2007scape,not_removed,the first graphical update was too detailed but i do hope they offer something in the middle the bis crossbow should be more than just a hunter crossbow recolor
2007scape,not_removed,male armadyl shouldnt have gotten changed either how about an upgrade kit for the male armadyl set to revert back to the old and original look
2007scape,not_removed,looks like a white hunters crossbow to me
2007scape,not_removed,how is an eagle head simple though thats like if the sara sword had saradomins head on the hilt the dragon hunter one has it because its a specialized weapon by its name armadyl cbow isnt
2007scape,not_removed,what armadyl is a bird god followed by birds from bird world his generals crossbow makes sense to have an eagle head on it dragon hunter crossbow is simple and that is what makes it so nice armadyl crossbow doesnt need to be the blue and gold bobbledygook from just make it not kebbit crossbow
2007scape,not_removed,print screen paste into paint crop as needed none of this taking pictures of your screen
2007scape,not_removed,nice rune dagger
2007scape,not_removed,took me a whole clues i screamed like a girl a littlehad to share
2007scape,not_removed,grats i just got rangers the other week from my medium clue didnt even know it was possible blew my mind
2007scape,not_removed,dat tn panel glare

2007scape,not_removed,get owta my neighbourhood yo
2007scape,not_removed,sure have
2007scape,not_removed,i think you mean in elf land
2007scape,not_removed,nah ur just dedicated
2007scape,not_removed,australia
2007scape,not_removed,lol u seen the same car
2007scape,not_removed,a dedicated nerd
2007scape,not_removed,dont wear those boots when ranging bro
2007scape,not_removed,very spooky
2007scape,not_removed,really wanna get my uim complete then just get a bond and try some easy clues for swag and go back to do dragon slayer
2007scape,not_removed,dey are spice to not where tho
2007scape,not_removed,definitely not the time this was posted within a week
2007scape,not_removed,or since its two handed buff its melee stats and make it a baller hybrid weapon maybe a small magic damage boost to seal the deal it also has the highest prayer bonus in the game for a magic staff afaik so theres that it has the potential to be a very impressive weapon i think
2007scape,not_removed,nice try op i know uve been rcing lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,its a drop chance what the fuck
2007scape,not_removed,ive always wanted this spell any spell that looks like steelbronzeiron dragon breathe
2007scape,not_removed,i mean theres nothing wrong with your idea i just dont see who would use it seeing trident is already super cheap
2007scape,not_removed,panic buy lavas
2007scape,not_removed,i love the idea of a new spell specific to this staff but i dont know about decreasing its drop rate to that much
2007scape,not_removed,cant we just give it a good magic attackdef bonus maybe on par or slightly better than trident no free runes no built in spells
2007scape,not_removed,i would only support it if the old staves got deleted
2007scape,not_removed,this is actually one of the more interesting pieces of equipment in the game tzhaar staff is a unique staff that has a ton of melee defense packed with prayer bonus magic bonus even magic defense while im all in for creating fresh and lowerlevel alternatives to higherlevel items i think the tzhaar staff is hybrid enough to warrant a different treatment than the rest of them suggestions increase its magic bonus and attack bonuses barrelchest anchor has the same attack requirement yet has a much higher attack bonus give it a special effect allow the berserker necklace to work with spells stat changes crush attack magic attack doubled with fire spells but only when using lava runes strength prayer defenses stab defense slash defense crush defense magic defense lava surge when casting any fire spell has a chance to activate lava surge dealing damage every magic levels to the target has a base accuracy of unlike for the other fire spells cast when this staff is equipped for this effect to work the user would have to consume lava runes instead of fire runes when casting the fire spells tldr obsidian staff is a hybrid if not even tribid given its defenses meleemagic staff its in the best interest of the community to make it good in both but not excel in either instead of changing it to some generic mage staff
2007scape,not_removed,and would be able to hit other players
2007scape,not_removed,would people go for this instead of iban staff though i know it doesnt hit as hard but being autocast lke trident would make it a go to for some people
2007scape,not_removed,i read the title completely wrong for some reason i read staff change as if there was going to be a staff change in regards to a rehaul of the tzhaar shopkeepers and there were gonna be new npcs
2007scape,not_removed,i always thought it was silly they made this item a drop and at the same time available to purchase for tokkul
2007scape,not_removed,ive asked several qa streams if the obby staff could get an upgrade something simple as making it one handed for fashionscape which is why i use it but they have always ignored me hopefully this post will get some attention although i dont completely agree with ops suggestion anything is better than what we have now
2007scape,not_removed,good but seems fucking op man
2007scape,not_removed,yes please have banked
2007scape,not_removed,ok im getting a bit tired of these obby staff suggestions now
2007scape,not_removed,agree but keep the droprate the same
2007scape,not_removed,lava or would fire earth work i find it very hard to imagine this would ever be a better alternative to iban blast due to cost i suggest reducing the cost to chaos fire earth tokkul being aware that you can buy tokkul to get around the cost instead allow charges to be added a la bonecrusher by absorbing tokkul you receive not from shops dialogue to collect or charge staff after fight caves pits automatically added to staff when tokkul dropped by tzhaar these charges can be checked like the chargesleft on ibans staff alongside the actual spellcharges left on the staff
2007scape,not_removed,why dont you just leave it alone not everything has to have a use
2007scape,not_removed,panic buy toktzmejtal
2007scape,not_removed,ibans blast hits at magic imo it should be per magic levels otherwise support
2007scape,not_removed,panic buy tzhaar staffs
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt mind seeing a complete rework to staffswands in general giving alot of the midhigh tiered ones their own spells
2007scape,not_removed,i like the concept but the spell seems a bit strong for a chaos rune level spell even with using chaos runes maybe if it had a minispellbook that you could select from in the autocast area in the combat menu that would have or levels of spells
2007scape,not_removed,imo we need more magic weapons that are considering the only other one is ahrims staff and literally nobody uses ahrims full set
2007scape,not_removed,and stockpiling the staves from ge
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt everyone rc lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,naww go attack a tzhaar mage and check the animation they use
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt the attack of a salamander looks like that
2007scape,not_removed,trident is nearly gpcast this would only be per cast
2007scape,not_removed,every other tzhaar item has that rarity
2007scape,not_removed,why would you update dead content to keep it dead
2007scape,not_removed,way too complicated oo
2007scape,not_removed,cant tell if troll or not anyway way too op and while were at it lets give mage a melee reduction and change how combat works
2007scape,not_removed,iban blast requires the regular spellbook like most worthwhile spells this could be a good use for barrowsscorpia were you want to freeze the monster once but for cost efficiency use a different spell mainly a ironman thing though
2007scape,not_removed,i would be surprised if there were even that many in game lol
2007scape,not_removed,not a bad idea
2007scape,not_removed,thats kind of the point of putting it in the game jokeparody items aside
2007scape,not_removed,not everything needs to be interesting and extremely difficult to obtain either yet it is a shame when those items dont have any use whatsoever
2007scape,not_removed,ibans requires a quest needs to be upgraded for initially and every time its broken needs to be recharged and is locked to the normal spellbook this has no spellbook requirement is quite cheap to cast and has no requirements other than magic nbsp itd be quite overpowered to buff it that much as the main use would be for alternate spellbooks andor saved inventory space
2007scape,not_removed,cast speed
2007scape,not_removed,ahrims staff is honestly hilariously bad its legitimately useless nbsp item attack level magic level hands magic bonus autoancients degrades useless master wand yes no no ancient staff yes no no ahrims staff no yes yes
2007scape,not_removed,i think thats why he said make the drop more common
2007scape,not_removed,i havent done any lava runes my runecrafting is i did all max profit things
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it does but only the close up dragonfire im talking about those big pixalated fire balls that the metal dragons constantly fires at you from a distance
2007scape,not_removed,ironmen who are not slayer and dont wanna use regular magic book iban blast there is a huge market for an easier to obtain staff with built in spell usable on any magic book
2007scape,not_removed,not every update needs to bring another bis into the game the item should be good but does not need to be the best
2007scape,not_removed,read the tldr
2007scape,not_removed,by that i dont suggest fundamentally changing how magic works just some extra defense for this staffit already has some if community likes this chance i assume we can poll adding defenses to other staves like ahrims btw ahrims also has significant melee defenses countering your argument about this change being op ahrims staff would make a better candidate for an antimelee staff anyway since obsidian staffs defenses are divided between magic and melee but theres no reason we cant poll this for the other staves as well
2007scape,not_removed,err sarcasm lava is like the most common rune in the game probably
2007scape,not_removed,i was actually considering making a post almost identical to yours but with better graphics especially the lavafall animation for starters along with some style differences that do more damage are slower but you hit the nail on the head and got it out dont mean to be cocky i just spend way too much time on the aesthetics i might do it when this post fades
2007scape,not_removed,op says nothing about cast speed in the post are we assuming tick now
2007scape,not_removed,damn didnt realize it was that bad at least make it autocast ancients so the set effect will be slightly more useful
2007scape,not_removed,so activation of the dfs
2007scape,not_removed,and who cares about the ironmen
2007scape,not_removed,i agree but why buff something to the point where it is still never going to be used a good magic attackdef bonus maybe on par or slightly better than trident magic attack and defense would be on par with the trident its a handed weapon which now has the exact same offensivedefensive bonuses as the ancient staff but it lacks the ability to autocast lacks the ability to use a shield costs more than twice as much and has a higher requirement to use you honestly think thats a fair buff there would still never be a place where someone would use it over ancient staff not even for ironmen
2007scape,not_removed,it attacks at the same speed and has the same attack wield requirements as a dragon battleaxe yet you gave it the same strength bonus and higher accuracy a staff shouldnt be the best melee weapon at a certain attack tier its bad enough the staff of dead is bis for anything melee related and should be changed imo there is no way this isnt op and i am literally only taking into consideration the melee stats
2007scape,not_removed,the staff not the lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,yeah as bad as the ahrims set effect is the staff itself is worse also the amulet of the damned set effect is worthless as well a chance to deal more damage is a damage increase on average occult necklace has more magic accuracy and is a damage increase amulet of the damned is also degradable nbsp in theory amulet of the damned despite being lower dps gives mage a tiny bit more ko potential but people dont mage for its ko potential
2007scape,not_removed,its a big portion of the player base lol fuck load bigger than the pure community
2007scape,not_removed,tbh who cares about narrowminded bigots like you more like it
2007scape,not_removed,the obsidian staff is a twohanded weapon dragon battleaxe with a defender has more accuracy and strength though if youre comparing weapons you might as well compare it to the dragon scimitar which outdpses both dragon battleaxe and the obsidian staff by alot even though they all belong in the same tier dragon battleaxe also provides utility via spec
2007scape,not_removed,he was talking about lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,people dont mage for its ko potential walks into wildy and gets barrageags combod for
2007scape,not_removed,apart from sotd pures
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think the ironman community is bigger than the pure community its been around for a while
2007scape,not_removed,as an ironman your comment is ridiculous hes not a bigot just a bit of a prick
2007scape,not_removed,lol salty
2007scape,not_removed,its extra strength and less accuracy with a defender and you are comparing a melee weapon to a fucking staff this is op as shit
2007scape,not_removed,congrats you got kod by an ags not magic
2007scape,not_removed,ironmen community would clock more in game time than the pure community dont have the evidence but common sense sides with me you could probably compare with ironmen on mathlabs
2007scape,not_removed,its extra strength and less accuracy with a defender ah true and you are comparing a melee weapon to a fucking staff an obsidian staff thats supposed to be a hybrid weapon anyway it doesnt really matter as dragon weapons arent supposed to be good dps aside from scimitar this is op as shit lol no scimitar deals far more dps than any of these weapons including even the barrelchest anchor which belongs in the same tier
2007scape,not_removed,youre forgetting about and hundreds of accounts are at those defense levels for clanning
2007scape,not_removed,source on it supposed to be a hybrid weapon
2007scape,not_removed,yo im down to buff this bad boy but i dont get why staves should be compared to other melee weapons or how u think its a hybrid weapon
2007scape,not_removed,aint pures even aint pure its a failed pure
2007scape,not_removed,ok mr pure expert you seem to know what youre talking about
2007scape,not_removed,i do you are not a pure if you are not pure
2007scape,not_removed,how is this impressive literally these streamers scout themself and all you do is mass up to kill them and then think its tough to do other teams can do the same they just arent that scummy
2007scape,not_removed,streamsniping is scummy af
2007scape,not_removed,tata is so fucking aids
2007scape,not_removed,tata is allowed to pk cuz rot milan and bodiedsalad dont want to do sdmm besides qualify for tourny lol no point besides swapping
2007scape,not_removed,clearly just doing it for recognition or something but nobody really gives a shit if you and a clan can kill a solo player twitch ends up full of people training and thats just pushing away potential new players that deadman attracts every season
2007scape,not_removed,i completely understand that teaming is going to happen not to mention it should be expected when playing playing something this competitive but it definitely pushes away people who are only playing to try the game mode
2007scape,not_removed,one is a fucking worthless animal and the other is a goat seriously this is the doucebag who threatened promised to beat up kieren at the next runefest for banning his account
2007scape,not_removed,oakdice was a savage
2007scape,not_removed,i just see the same picture side by side unless im missing something
2007scape,not_removed,i just watched that last night roasted
2007scape,not_removed,i made uncharged orbs using molten glass took me hrs to glassblow of them theyre cheap also
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,ill give it a try i already did this for ty
2007scape,not_removed,a couple that slays together stays together
2007scape,not_removed,she probably needs to have done the first tasks which give slayer points if i had to guess
2007scape,not_removed,we both approve of this
2007scape,not_removed,thanks we will give this a try
2007scape,not_removed,i believe so really it doesnt matter much becaue or youre gunna hit quick and the after that will be clutch
2007scape,not_removed,i also was wondering if had an idea of what is the best use of the hours protection i know before it was lavas but they are removed
2007scape,not_removed,if youre making your first account for the season my suggestion would be to steal cakes for food and grind hill giants since you cant be attacked you can safely focus combat stats especially prayer if you use a bond or something and do two accounts train one in a money skill like hunter or something you can get hunter in the
2007scape,not_removed,im probably going to get top but before i would to get a tons of money and maybe swap to make up for the bond i used coz i alrdy played dmm on my main accp
2007scape,not_removed,so that means sometimes random events straight up yell im high af at him lmao id follow this guy around all day
2007scape,not_removed,cooks assistant
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,your
2007scape,not_removed,try reinstalling it worked for me if that doesnt work load it up and click the opengl button in the status bar area of osb i had a blank black screen until i clicked the opengl button and it started working again
2007scape,not_removed,same
2007scape,not_removed,worked ty
2007scape,not_removed,i can finally get the client to load finally after days but i cant even log in man if i could see the ddoser irl i would clock em good
2007scape,not_removed,i really thought they would get tired of it soon i wonder if they could be prosecuted for being an obstruction to business
2007scape,not_removed,ddos is illegal so yeah
2007scape,not_removed,its a federal crime the un and the us both see it as an act of terrorism very very illegal
2007scape,not_removed,nah just alch it
2007scape,not_removed,unless u stay def on ur iron man its useless but for its not really worth droptrading its a nice thing to make a loot tab in bank nothing else
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont plan on quitting your ironman id keep it
2007scape,not_removed,no blaze it
2007scape,not_removed,coins sick kappa
2007scape,not_removed,thanks fam
2007scape,not_removed,ok ty idk if its decent or not cx
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,seems very qualityoflife esque i like it
2007scape,not_removed,as long as the cast time is the same as clicking the npc yourself i have no problems with it
2007scape,not_removed,someone will cry like devalues my rcingturael slaying
2007scape,not_removed,then i could talk to the the sawmill guy to make the best money in the game and all the diary people for free shit not to mention buying random shit from shops like the planks in morton

2007scape,not_removed,holy shit your macroing is amazing i have never seen switches or even pking of this caliber before but it seems to produce awesome results
2007scape,not_removed,ever try streaming you have cool mechanics that might be interesting to watch live w commentary
2007scape,not_removed,agreed but i doubt it will happen for a long time since its a buyable
2007scape,not_removed,help me account got hacked posts in the morning
2007scape,not_removed,dont download this when its released theres no way to be sure that this is in any way safe if you want to potentially get hackedratted go ahead at least wait a while i know hype is strong but your account is more important than some eyecandy
2007scape,not_removed,this is pretty sketch i wouldnt download this until jagex gives us the thumbs up on this
2007scape,not_removed,how can we be sure this is a safe client
2007scape,not_removed,when it comes out ill check it out in a vm ill check back in with the results
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours told ya its bs
2007scape,not_removed,nothing happened to the site its just at
2007scape,not_removed,ill be skeptical until i see people streaming it
2007scape,not_removed,can you link the website
2007scape,not_removed,would still like a website link
2007scape,not_removed,hi guys im a bit new here but was an archived post from months ago on the same topic
2007scape,not_removed,well then did something happen
2007scape,not_removed,nvm boys the timers back at days hours rip
2007scape,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvsiltjzpng looks like were waiting longer lads
2007scape,not_removed,i like how for months ppl were getting soo excited for this and now everyone is scared to use it
2007scape,not_removed,what is this
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hour
2007scape,not_removed,bought by a company you all know rsbuddy who is he talking about

2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours lets try this on a test account
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hour
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours
2007scape,not_removed,if jagex ended up buying out this project and implementing it into the official client yeah right i would totally be willing to pay an extra for my membership thats how fucking good this project looked
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours
2007scape,not_removed,same ppl said all this shit about osb so you all look retarded its safe
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hours
2007scape,not_removed,timer is at its bullshit probably never going to change or release anything this release has been plauged since that little ray totty had creative control its all just been some fucked up publicity bullshit
2007scape,not_removed,yeh people worked on a client for months just for a one time get rich quick scheme s
2007scape,not_removed,tbh try it on some new acc
2007scape,not_removed,you were right nearly day wait now
2007scape,not_removed,jagex will never give the thumbs up on third party clients sorry but its true
2007scape,not_removed,theyve never given any client a green light other than their own and they never will
2007scape,not_removed,lol idk this is probably some scam tbh but we will see
2007scape,not_removed,we cant be sure osbuddy is a safe client either people still use it
2007scape,not_removed,thanks friend
2007scape,not_removed,results
2007scape,not_removed,oh look at the time
2007scape,not_removed,probably making an announcement today or trailer
2007scape,not_removed,yeah just like with the double exp weekends good thing those are regularly being streamed
2007scape,not_removed,yeah that guy sold the client to an unknown company which turned hdhelper into oshd though on the message on hdhelpernet he mentions that he sold it to a firm you all probably know im hoping its the rsbuddy team or anyone else thats knowntrusted just imagine how amazing an hd client would be with all osbuddy plugins o
2007scape,not_removed,its at
2007scape,not_removed,probably that offset and countdown meant there was always going to be countdowns think about it it was for maybe hours the countdown is at days hours so maybe it was glitched for hours but the countdown is supposed to start after the first one and it is supposed to be the same as the first one but with an offset of days idk lets just wait
2007scape,not_removed,someone named totty made a cool hd client there is a vid of it on frameds channel and he said another company bought it his website went to this site which has a live countdown no one knows anything about this excecpt its an hd client the website is oshdco
2007scape,not_removed,lets hope so
2007scape,not_removed,thats some flawed logic you got there mate how many people are currently using this hd client how many are using osbuddy roughly half the osrs population now which client do you think has the highest chance of being malicious the one nobody has had the opportunity to even test or the one that thousands of people have used without any problems
2007scape,not_removed,nah i think the page source indicates something may happen at est with the offset i dont know why they screwed up their timer source if thats wrong let me know i heard it from someone else and checked it out myself
2007scape,not_removed,nah i think the page source indicates something may happen at est with the offset i dont know why they screwed up their timer source if thats wrong let me know i heard it from someone else and checked it out myself
2007scape,not_removed,nah i think the page source indicates something may happen at pm est with the offset i dont know why they screwed up their timer if thats wrong let me know i heard it from someone else and checked it out myself might be am would make more sense
2007scape,not_removed,its up for download with hd being a month idk if its a scam
2007scape,not_removed,dont know why this is so outlandish to some people hardly unlikely
2007scape,not_removed,well yeah its quite possible theres a high probability that they may be their intention
2007scape,not_removed,it could still install some malicious software or script without you knowing
2007scape,not_removed,you have to installrun this shit right they could easily install an actual rat or something else on your pc when you run the code dont do it
2007scape,not_removed,cant find the tweet for proof of what i said it was a tweet from years ago and i didnt want to scroll that far down as it wouldve taken forever my bad i still know for a fact i am right but i understand why people would think im making this up i have nothing to gain by lying
2007scape,not_removed,ill find the tweet later on it was years ago from mod ash
2007scape,not_removed,no but da wilson he is so very rich but if he did not get hak then could get hak
2007scape,not_removed,sure
2007scape,not_removed,no client has been released yet
2007scape,not_removed,told ya its bs
2007scape,not_removed,how does it take you minutes to find a link op put in which is also named in the screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,thank you
2007scape,not_removed,are they going to send an email or something
2007scape,not_removed,the thing is i wish theyd be consistent with whatever theyre counting down for and theyd email us or something about changes there is nothing i can find from the site or source code or anything thats already there ive gotten nothing even after subscribing to them yeah just wait i guess
2007scape,not_removed,is there anyway i could view the full twitch vod his twitch channel is gone
2007scape,not_removed,like pm est
2007scape,not_removed,because you could make a lot more money by charging money for it
2007scape,not_removed,these guys get a cut of the gp from the stolen accounts
2007scape,not_removed,sandboxie
2007scape,not_removed,virtual machine and make a new ironman or something for a brand new runescape experience
2007scape,not_removed,personally not scared about a rat its not that hard to detect
2007scape,not_removed,but they said that the osbuddy devs let them look at their code and confirmed that there was nothing fishy going on source
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,lets hope that company that bought it is trusted since it does say i have recently been approached with an enticing acquisition offer from a firm you all probably already know on the hdhelpernet website that redirects to this
2007scape,not_removed,ayy
2007scape,not_removed,not named in the screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,shows less than days to go on my screen
2007scape,not_removed,yo the sites up its basically osbuddy and for hd its a month
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think so rip
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know for sure as the page source doesnt really tell me which part of the day that is so i would make a tad more of an educated guess and put it on the morning because something tells me a computer would count in format until you tell it to count in twelves so pm est would look like idunno man update look at their timer now omfg lol
2007scape,not_removed,think of how much yen you could get from those chinese gold sellers tho
2007scape,not_removed,yes but people should consider the fact that it is something that requires ongoing work and support its comparatively simple to get a rudimentary version working then sideload malicious instructions to said client nbsp to clarify im not saying thats what will happen just that its a possibility and should not be dismissed prematurely
2007scape,not_removed,not legally
2007scape,not_removed,didnt think of sandboxing now im interested to see what theyve actually realized still wouldnt run it nonisolated

2007scape,not_removed,didnt think of sandboxing now im interested to see what theyve actually realized still wouldnt run it nonisolated
2007scape,not_removed,i cant remember the source but i do remember hearing they did give the thumps up quite a while ago
2007scape,not_removed,shit youre really gonna make me find a tweet from years ago ill find it in a bit just woke up it was from mod ash i believe if youd like to find it yourself
2007scape,not_removed,realistically its probably osbuddy konduit is another candidate but its less likely to have the means as its primarily a free client
2007scape,not_removed,interestingly they both use the same hosting provider
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,youre kidding right httpiimgurcomrtpkedzpng times in the original screenshot
2007scape,not_removed,it was actually finished counting then they restarted it
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,you are going to cinema
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy charges money for a pro version
2007scape,not_removed,this is false they never officially endorsed it it just so happened that one of the devs for osb worked at jagex for a time osbuddy and its dev team are not nor have ever been officially endorsed by jagex
2007scape,not_removed,how do you put a p in thumb its nowhere near the b
2007scape,not_removed,runeloader is another but yeah osbuddy seems like the only one that could buy something out hopefully by firm he meant one of the client companies ill keep my expectations low just in case
2007scape,not_removed,oooh didnt look at that not going to get my hopes up but if an osbuddy hd client with plugins releases im going to be fucking stoked even though id rather have regular i think the realistic hd is really cool as well
2007scape,not_removed,why the long face
2007scape,not_removed,how is that the link to the website it could be oldschoolhdcom based on that
2007scape,not_removed,they obviously cant endorse osb its a party client but mod ash posted a tweet a long ass time ago saying that they were allowed access to the osb code and found out that there was nothing sketchy going on idk how im going to find this tweet for you guys but ill try my best downvote away if i cant find it i guess
2007scape,not_removed,also just wanted to say the develepor for what was called rsbuddy was actually a botting software for runescape originally the developer for the botting software ended up being hired by jagex for and worked to develop antibot software on their servers there something the osrs dev team said they want to implement aswell
2007scape,not_removed,there was a post on forums where a jmod was saying osbuddy is safe to use iirc can ursbmatt confirm
2007scape,not_removed,they may not endorse it but they did say they look at the code to make sure nothing malicious goes on in any new update
2007scape,not_removed,cause autocorrect doesnt exist
2007scape,not_removed,matthew osbuddy dev said it wasnt them
2007scape,not_removed,sorry i should have made that clearer its hdhelpernet and oshdco which use the same hosting provider
2007scape,not_removed,i am a horse
2007scape,not_removed,jacmob
2007scape,not_removed,jacmob
2007scape,not_removed,false
2007scape,not_removed,aw now im really curious who it is
2007scape,not_removed,ohhh
2007scape,not_removed,you werent scammed exactly i think the term your looking for was conned you werent promised anything in return for any sort of gain but you were tricked through the use of deception to give your money to a poor noob who was simply a person putting on a show with two accounts these kind of people exist in real life and also unfortunately in video games at least its only and not some massive cleaver scam for your entire bank
2007scape,not_removed,lmao this is why i refrain on giving poor ass people ingame and irl any sort of currency whatsoever
2007scape,not_removed,you werent scammed you willingly gave him money for nothing in return if you expected something in return and he tricked you into thinking you would get that something when in fact you wont then you would have been scammed
2007scape,not_removed,lol how is that even a loss lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt a new scam you voluntarily gave the noob knowing full well you were getting nothing in return
2007scape,not_removed,youre right but still yet im trying to make sure other players dont fall for this
2007scape,not_removed,disliked comment just because of your name
2007scape,not_removed,fall for what lol you give away your cash willingly were you expecting him to give it back with interest
2007scape,not_removed,ok i see youre the type to ignore an educated discussion and focus on the littlest of things that dont matter at all
2007scape,not_removed,ops point is that the person he gave money to was a fake its like when people who are welloff dress up like a poor person and beg on corners with signs that moneyfoodclothes could have gone to an actual person in need
2007scape,not_removed,and i see youre the type to call blatant disgusting racism the littlest of things ironic considering that you think you are having an educated discussion
2007scape,not_removed,ah yes mr killniggers let us have a mature and educated discussion
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure if you can read but i just just explainedinformed how this player wasnt necessarily scammed that is before you came in here with your political correctness
2007scape,not_removed,just just
2007scape,not_removed,theyre really never worth doing imo magic is about the only way to kill them without having to pray melee or bank alot
2007scape,not_removed,fire strike or fire bolt with chaos gaunts bring antifire potion and u wont use any food
2007scape,not_removed,take super att str or attdrag battle axe for the spec extended antifires food tunas or lobs is enough and pray flick you can easily get kills per trip flicking personally i then use the ardy cape to tp to the church to recharge prayer there then take the battle field tree to the strongold bank there and go again i got similar lvls to you and this is how i do them mage safespotting makes them pretty easy too
2007scape,not_removed,theyre a task you should skip even if you had better levels if youre going to melee them use stab or dont bother because their defenses are high in other melee stats zamorakian hasta works pretty good on them imo you can only mage them and your magic sucks anyways so theyre still not worth doing i would only do these if you want variety or are going for a random vissy drop personally ive done then before with a hasta but i had melee stats theyre ok then i guess still not a good task theyre a skip or block task
2007scape,not_removed,im going to use magic then
2007scape,not_removed,ill bring some of those thanks
2007scape,not_removed,im not very good at pray flicking so im going to try mage safespotting thanks
2007scape,not_removed,do you fly
2007scape,not_removed,is where fashionscapes at xd
2007scape,not_removed,punch it into google and theres alch calculators just try to pick one that is recentregularly updated its a third party client that has built in features like exp tracking hiscores and many many features definitely worth looking into it has a free version so try but i highly recommend getting the pro version for a few bucks a month
2007scape,not_removed,sprint wtf is this
2007scape,not_removed,you now have a virus
2007scape,not_removed,mod ash spooky me
2007scape,not_removed,idk but dovydas made a video of him doing it so it might be safe maybe try doing irregularly sometimes so it wont be detected as botting

2007scape,not_removed,tldr
2007scape,not_removed,im probably in million but i dont stake and still use the duel arena freqvently
2007scape,not_removed,each to their own it seems reasonable to renovate something from time to time
2007scape,not_removed,tbh youre a minority in this so dont be offended if your message is lost on well everyone else if your main complaint is the rules are going to be more clear and people are going to be staking faster then i want to live in your world low level staking is very undesirable for most outsiders and you wont see too many range or mage stakes except for those low levels my point being if you are not duel arena savvy already then this update will in fact help you and i think that is healthier for the game and community than an inclusive society of percentage huggers multilogers and scammers im out of there from doing over legit stakes on my main i would like to see more noobs there for max cb
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck and i still need a shield left half for ardougne diary lol great achievement

2007scape,not_removed,seed box
2007scape,not_removed,the censoring is a meme
2007scape,not_removed,i feel stupid that i thought he was serious
2007scape,not_removed,man i played rs about max combat and always wore ring of wealth and never got either of those dropsnot like theyre worth much have they increased the chances in osrs havent done much combat yet
2007scape,not_removed,they recently revamped the row
2007scape,not_removed,credits to diy bendy
2007scape,not_removed,okay but what world
2007scape,not_removed,world
2007scape,not_removed,edit nvm found it thanks
2007scape,not_removed,if you bring flowers and give them out to everyone doing it you can just give people flowers ea and tell them to plant them by incantationsdark manuscripts gonna repost this as i feel not many people do it but it speeds up favor a lot

2007scape,not_removed,anyone remember bookmarking the world url so you could log in faster even though the world was full you could still basically cut in line and be ahead of anyone refreshing the page to see if world wasnt full
2007scape,not_removed,just like the ol days
2007scape,not_removed,because ice poseidon is hosting a drop party there atm
2007scape,not_removed,good stuff mane
2007scape,not_removed,lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,ice poseidon had viewers and was planning a drop party so yea
2007scape,not_removed,only are ge spammers
2007scape,not_removed,ah memories
2007scape,not_removed,hell yeah
2007scape,not_removed,it wasnt lol
2007scape,not_removed,he first announced it at ge
2007scape,not_removed,just let him have this one jared
2007scape,not_removed,im just hoping when theyre implemented the preeoc kids quit whining ruining oldschool rs
2007scape,not_removed,the defense bonus isnt even the issue with the prayers that has its the fact people who dont pk think it will make a huge impact on lowmid lvl pking when in reality its to many combat levels from prayer vs other stats to make it actually worth making a void account around it not including def cuz the defense doesnt even do anything and the other game is completely different combat wise so i dont think its fair to say that def reqs were added for balancing purposes when there is no such thing as a pure on the other game
2007scape,not_removed,i just hope that some day retards kids will quit assuming oldschool means and back they only had a complete backup of oldschool was born from eoc therefore oldschool is for anyone who didnt like eoc
2007scape,not_removed,its called build variety it would create new builds lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,not if its def
2007scape,not_removed,yes it does
2007scape,not_removed,how does it create new builds if it requires def it would literally just let range tanks be stronger else it doesnt effect because melee is a better option at those levels anyways
2007scape,not_removed,go kill banshees stop xp wasting
2007scape,not_removed,was an antibot measure back in the day i believe
2007scape,not_removed,google said its slower
2007scape,not_removed,was just gonna comment that
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it was also if im not wrong theres also chance to spawn in spot where you are stuck behind the portal but im not sure if it was in osrs or at i remember that when i did pure essence mining in darkscape it happened quite often
2007scape,not_removed,there is a correct way however
2007scape,not_removed,north ladder
2007scape,not_removed,do you have opinions and thoughts of your own or do you just bandwagon it all i didnt even hear a single logical argument in there just the same haha autism xd jokes mixed with echoed popular reddit opinions about hexis dope vid
2007scape,not_removed,you seem to conflate criticismdissenting opinions with being a salty crybaby hexis fag as though paying players in a game organised around community interaction arent allowed to complain about decisions they dont agree with just because jagex implement a change doesnt make it necessarily the correct decision the osrs player base should be more acutely aware of that fact than anyone one of the things you say in your video is just play the game i think the point for a lot of people who used ahk is that they were the vast majority of ahk users used it to expedite menial tasks that dont add to gameplay such as bankingdropping i havent seen anyone defending the use of scripts and rightly so if we come back to your point about just play the game i agree runescape is all about personal achievement instead of player competition someone using ahk to mine slightly faster than you doesnt impact on your own ability to mine or your enjoyment of the game its not a zerosum game why does it matter if some people enjoy using ahk for click intensive skilling youre not forced to and you lose nothing by choosing not to also whats this obsession with calling people autistic would that in someway invalidate their points or disentitle them from holding an opinion it just seems like you want to fit in with reddit memers which smacks as a little sad tbh
2007scape,not_removed,this is one of the dumbest videos i have seen in recent memory
2007scape,not_removed,boy or girl
2007scape,not_removed,the vid is pretty much me rambling and throwing in unfunny jokes while i do agree i didnt put in any logical argument that is basically my two cents on the whole ordeal but i do appreciate the input
2007scape,not_removed,i can agree with a lot of what you are saying here i just think it is slightly unfair for people to use ahk to make tasks easier and gain an edge over others and yeah i want to fit in with the reddit memers although i want to elevate the shitposting i do now into something better like actual videos and when i call people autistic i dont deny them an opinion thats just part of the unfunny persona of me in the video i call them autistic because they think ahk is fair game etc but overall i love your reply
2007scape,not_removed,i got boy puss
2007scape,not_removed,sorry to be harsh i just clicked on the vid expecting a conflicting view on the matter to maybe help me understand why people wanted it banned gl with youtube
2007scape,not_removed,thats fair enough your opinion is your right and i agree that the legitimacy of mouse keys in general is a conversation that needs to be had with the whole community i just feel like the whole youre autistic thing is a bit lazy and played out its kind of similar to what you see sjwtypes do where instead of challenging arguments and ideas they name call and throw labels at people they dont agree with just my fair play for responding to criticism peace
2007scape,not_removed,oh no you are alright man i respect your opinion enough i dont expect my content to be good to begin with i am doing this as a hobby of sorts i find it fun to make videos and all that i didnt see your response harsh at all the video is just me spewing out an opinion a large majority of scapers share and throwing in unfunny cancer in there
2007scape,not_removed,the effect of losing free trade
2007scape,not_removed,what its like to be smited
2007scape,not_removed,explore speculate hypothesize as to some of the reasons why osrs appeals to an older demographic as opposed to what are some common themes that are present throughout osrs is there an underlying theme what would you consider to be the developers long term stylistic approach or auteur what are the differences between and osrs or osrs vs other games and from what can you conclude about these differences what are the causes influences the effects etc would be hard to write an actual research paper on osrs because you usually need to cite your information with reputable sources so consider looking into a larger idea like the impact on mmo games on young adults teenagers etc whatever
2007scape,not_removed,staking addictions some examples to use and talk about the one guy who farms whips all day to stake and lose them at the end of the day the one guy who farms zulrah for hrs a day to stake it at the end
2007scape,not_removed,how do updates such as zulrah that drops skilling related loot influence the market for these items think about how the crashing of these skilling items ex zulrahs rune essence and coal ore would effect people mining for these resources an example for the prompt above how would a motherload miner feel if their stack of coal ore was reduced in price all because of an influx of noted coal ore drops from players killing zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,i second this
2007scape,not_removed,what client is that
2007scape,not_removed,i hope you have an o to smoke down now

2007scape,not_removed,love konduit
2007scape,not_removed,i tried it and it felt like kmart osbuddy
2007scape,not_removed,while i agree the options and layout are not visually appealing the client and its features are much smoother than osbuddy thats what matters imo and its free
2007scape,not_removed,does it use less ram than osb
2007scape,not_removed,yup and less cpu and its smoother
2007scape,not_removed,they made so much gp off this lol
2007scape,not_removed,if only they could bring back spearing as someone who actually pks in multi cant be asked to fight people wearing only ballista dhides and godswords

2007scape,not_removed,was it only in for one day or is it still in the game
2007scape,not_removed,aw man i missed it
2007scape,not_removed,here it is
2007scape,not_removed,thanks so much
2007scape,not_removed,twitch cant really ban someone for viewbotting unless they show it on stream otherwise people could just viewbot small streamers and instantly get them banned the thing that delusional fans of some scummy streamers need to realise just because twitch cant prove its the streamer who viewbots doesnt mean that a streamer isnt viewbotting when they are doing the exact same obvious thing for years
2007scape,not_removed,bigmeatyhorsebutthole
2007scape,not_removed,my vote is for the guy without the shitty overlay
2007scape,not_removed,lol what do they expect suddenly people will come over from ice poseidon and want to see hours of money snek
2007scape,not_removed,so you can see if theyre getting viewbotted if the viewer list is smaller than the current views counter
2007scape,not_removed,chatters cx
2007scape,not_removed,when they are doing the exact same obvious thing for years cough emily cough
2007scape,not_removed,that same ugly kid on the left has been getting viewbotted consistently the past month every single day he claims its not him it definitely is
2007scape,not_removed,ive heard that if the streamer brings in a lot of revenue for the company they allow them to viewbot apparently everyone is corrupt
2007scape,not_removed,hi
2007scape,not_removed,why if emily can regularly viewbot viewers everyone should hell viewbot viewers at once fuck it
2007scape,not_removed,youre delusional if you think individual people were watching ice learn how to tie a tie knot last night if you sit in the stream long enough blocking the obvious chatter bots the chat actually dies pretty quickly
2007scape,not_removed,not necessarily because not all viewers have registered usernames but its very unlikely
2007scape,not_removed,essentially
2007scape,not_removed,there is always viewers watching her when the drama was happening there was but now it has decreased the chat is always same people talking and when something crazy happens its people spamming
2007scape,not_removed,source on this
2007scape,not_removed,well if they ban every channel that gets viewbottet then noone would be left on their side to stream nothing they can realistically do about streamers viewbotting unless they show their viewbot on stream then its gg
2007scape,not_removed,thats not corruption theyre under no legal obligation to enforce anything on their platform
2007scape,not_removed,spoiler alert bro
2007scape,not_removed,definitely when he was doing the drop party the people hopping to his worlds constantly were definitely not watching his stream mere coincidence
2007scape,not_removed,im totally pulling this number out of my ass since i cant find the source right now but i remember hearing from a twitch staff that somewhere around of the viewer base isnt logged in on an account obviously these guys are viewbotting all im saying is you definitely dont have for example chatters if you have viewers if the guy has even people chatting i would say there is a good chance he isnt viewbotting
2007scape,not_removed,spam in the chat if youre a viewbot tehee literally mods spamming without the spamblock and occasional legit viewers doing the same such amazing proof
2007scape,not_removed,i find it odd when she starts streaming she instantly gets viewers
2007scape,not_removed,i meant corruption in terms of morality its cheating you way to the top of the page who cares about corruption in the corporatelegal side of the world its too late for that to be fixed lol
2007scape,not_removed,legalitymorality after all the holocaust was legal in germany
2007scape,not_removed,vod
2007scape,not_removed,you know how easy it is to make a twitch account right
2007scape,not_removed,not defending emily here because she probably does viewbot but people often forget that a lot of people watch twitch without twitch accounts heck the only people i know irl that watch twitch dont have accounts people without accounts cant type in chat and also wouldnt appear on the viewer list but would still count as a viewer what if emily has a weird following of year old men who just listen to her stream while at work dont down vote me for white knighting just explaining something i think people often forget
2007scape,not_removed,this was a month or so ago i dont completely remember i think the day after he won staking
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt necessarily mean anything untoward i didnt make an account for ages because i didnt want to talk in the chat most people probably think something similar
2007scape,not_removed,id rather lose my hearing permanently than listen to her voice every day at work
2007scape,not_removed,it can happen for sure but she is like never at viewers its always shes not the average titty streamer either i dont see any point why some old men would choose her
2007scape,not_removed,ice poseidon showed streamers viewcount with graphs people who viewbot have an immense rise as soon as they start and never get increases while legit streamers will have a slow increase until they either switch games or go offline he showed graphs of himself emily and and it clearly proved emily has been viewbotting while neither him or baby do
2007scape,not_removed,i dont even have the chat visible when i am watching twitch i only made an account because one of the streamers i watch semi regularly started giving points away to logged in accounts that could be gambled and used to redeem stuff and i made an account solely on that reason
2007scape,not_removed,i mean the whole basis of this post is the viewer count vs the people in chat count
2007scape,not_removed,her voice fucking kills me
2007scape,not_removed,good point i saw a graph of her viewer count rise and it gets to the same old in minutes whereas it takes other streamers hours to peak
2007scape,not_removed,ohh right im with you
2007scape,not_removed,that was good i actually cheered a little when the guy got roasted also the ending was hilarious
2007scape,not_removed,do i have to buy a bond for membership to kill dragons
2007scape,not_removed,this was awsome reminds me when i brought my boi to green drags for the first time p he was asking me the chances of getting pked and i told him that i have been pked once in hours i geared him up and brought him he dnt even get to kill dragon before he was pked p if only it ended like this video
2007scape,not_removed,yes you need membership to kill dragons
2007scape,not_removed,no just do dragon slayer
2007scape,not_removed,dosent
2007scape,not_removed,gets pet drop doesnt leave wilderness immediately
2007scape,not_removed,why did you not bank the second you got the pet its and you would lose it if a pker logged in i know it wasnt ur fault for losing it since it was a dc but ur an idiot for complaining that u didnt bank ur pet the second u got it
2007scape,not_removed,gets pet from wildy boss doesnt immediately run off
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i have had kc no pet and have other wild boss pets this one is the most camped by pkers clans in multi you should have ran for the hills the split second you saw that lil baby
2007scape,not_removed,first you say a couple of kills later now your saying the next kill after the pet make up your mind and next time you get any pet leave asap
2007scape,not_removed,just keep trying
2007scape,not_removed,be sure to include all of the following information in your appeal previous bank pins the oldest password you can remember oldest so they can verify the original account owner original character name isp and billing address used to create the account roughly when the account was created you provided a year but do you remember making it sometime in the summer or during school transaction ids as well as the last digits of the card most commonly used my account was hijacked an account that i made sometime in and i was able to recover it by providing all of the above information minus the transaction ids
2007scape,not_removed,also does anyone happen to know if entering incorrect information can hinder your chances of getting approval for recovery
2007scape,not_removed,keep trying to recover i dont even know what other information i could provide im really just hoping a jmod sees this post and can help me
2007scape,not_removed,ill give it a shot thanks for your help
2007scape,not_removed,whole point of phats in osrs is that they are easy to get and wont be max cash like in sorry bro
2007scape,not_removed,rares were polled to how they currently are i really doubt a significant amount of the community believes they should be handled differently now
2007scape,not_removed,id prefer them to be cheaper really i liked the idea of just adding them to diango for something like
2007scape,not_removed,wont happen
2007scape,not_removed,they use p hats and rares as a reward and bonus for holiday events they were stated by mod ronan they purposely are making sure they dont be come a rarity
2007scape,not_removed,holiday items should stay as they are there is no good reason to force phats to be expensive why do we need another gold sink why should we force people to lose party hats they fairly paid for or obtained
2007scape,not_removed,why though i think they should be regarded as rares just because theyre expensive in doesnt mean they cant be in lmao
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,anything can happen
2007scape,not_removed,why do we need another gold sink because there is gold constantly coming into the game and hardly any sinks to it
2007scape,not_removed,just because theyre expensive in doesnt mean they should be in
2007scape,not_removed,i think jagex doesnt want to make phats rare again thats why they dump them into the game like every holiday and in the end its their decision thats why i said what i said
2007scape,not_removed,okay but why phats first of all we would have to get rid of the current partyhats in game this alone is not a good idea you are creating a gold sink by first forcibly removing items that were obtained though completely legitimate means before they turn into the gp they are valued at the phat prices would be valued at each or something on that range so bringing more gold into the game its basically low alch all party hats in game then rereleasing said item at a decent gold sink is something like trident gp is something even noobs will pay to charge a trident its not going to make or break you on top of being cheap its a reoccuring cost on a mass scale it will be removing a decent chunk of gp then you have the stack of coins for poh that is targeted at wealthy players a straight cost for a cosmetic reward that changes nothing currently in place
2007scape,not_removed,and just because theyre expensive in doesnt mean that making them expensive in will turn into i just like to have certain items that are super valuable that could be an eventual goal for me or other to achieve in game because thats what rs is about achieving sought after stuff
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i know but honestly they would only be rare cause they would be expensive and they would always have a fixed price plus its a gp sink
2007scape,not_removed,i just like to have certain items that are super valuable that could be an eventual goal for me or other to achieve in game because thats what rs is about achieving sought after stuff ely shield and age gear are super valuable why not go for those
2007scape,not_removed,do you have max pvm gear an elysian all age yet if not then quit whining and go get it all
2007scape,not_removed,rofl gtfo with that shit go play if you want valuable party hats you twat
2007scape,not_removed,plus its a gp sink an unneeded gp sink
2007scape,not_removed,ely is a goal age is just kinda meh
2007scape,not_removed,not whining and a phat is different than that its a valuable end game cosmetic or should be
2007scape,not_removed,calm down
2007scape,not_removed,it was not intended to ever be like that nor should we force it to be so again
2007scape,not_removed,phat was different for the original runescape but this is a wholly seperate game it will never be an end game cosmetic here so stop wasting your time
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck i just realized the guy took my pair of flowers fuck that guy he fucking ruined it for me
2007scape,not_removed,you should go camp ice trolls in jaitzo mine for alchable drops can be quite lucrative for iron they also drop noted sharks
2007scape,not_removed,how did you do that
2007scape,not_removed,why though
2007scape,not_removed,buy base items from the kid trade for cocktail for the token for the contract etc etc
2007scape,not_removed,memories
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy automatically takes a screenshot when you level up
2007scape,not_removed,yes as i said i have the screenshots but all im trying to do is crop the levelup chatbox message in the same identical shape for levelups its too much of a hassle doing it manually
2007scape,not_removed,you can set up scripts in photoshop to crop a certain region assuming the screenshots are all the same position and dimension
2007scape,not_removed,this would be legit i dont know the first thing about engine work but i bet this would be hard to implement
2007scape,not_removed,i like it and would vote for it but it would never pass a poll as it is way too gamechanging for a skill cape perk i would like to see the ability to slather meat potions all over oneself to draw aggro
2007scape,not_removed,op
2007scape,not_removed,something something pures
2007scape,not_removed,i like ur idea i too would vote yes for this change if it is possible
2007scape,not_removed,the ability to not draw aggro from anything seems a bit silly taunt is quite nice tho although maybe a bit strong for afking
2007scape,not_removed,why to op imo this would create nmz everywhere
2007scape,not_removed,never heard of a clan that exclusively items generally a clan will return with item if they are being overpowered
2007scape,not_removed,ya rot
2007scape,not_removed,whos
2007scape,not_removed,or fires to keep you warm when wnitertodt bring the winter to zeah
2007scape,not_removed,im not sore of ur joking about zeah being like or not
2007scape,not_removed,pre eoc my main was like base i got some kills got some deaths i knew i wasnt pking for money but it was fun as hell if you want to pk to make your living gp wise a specialized build is highly recommended that being said you dont have to wait to be to go pk afaik there are people from all levels in the wildy pking who arent finished either if you are def people pk all the time without the highest stats and neither will you if you decided to get defence above like once you hit cb vengeance becomes almost necessary to kill people i highly recommend you do not stake even if you are everything its basically a rat hole
2007scape,not_removed,it certainly helps to have designated account builds to give yourself an advantage but its not mandatory
2007scape,not_removed,you will be at a disadvantage if you are a nonpking build going against a pking build that said not all pk builds are def there are def and def pk accounts also disadvantage is a relative term odds could be or they could be it depends on what your stats are and what their stats are
2007scape,not_removed,i mean you dont have to be maxed but at least combat to begin pking so you dont get wrecked by zerkers
2007scape,not_removed,what are your stats now post them and ill tell you what you should work towards
2007scape,not_removed,try pk first when u just throw yourself into members pk theres so much to learn regarding invy quick pray and switches watching your pray bar for prayer drop weapons specs etc all u need for is a rune and swordies and pots
2007scape,not_removed,what do you mean by rat hole
2007scape,not_removed,attk str def hp pray range mage could probably do like rune fights and stuff zerkers use to cry my def was too high tho
2007scape,not_removed,yea alot of work to start pking you could easily get srr mage and dharok pkbrid but if i was you i would start a pure pures you can use at any level start off at like range attack str or whatever str max lvl is at that lvl and all you need is to quest your attack and get mith gloves personally i only enjoy pure pking cause its constant hits
2007scape,not_removed,just get str mage and boom pking account
2007scape,not_removed,on my way with hellcat
2007scape,not_removed,why do people mostly splash on rats and not other mobs
2007scape,not_removed,i believe this was done intentionally previously you could use unnoted food on a bank and potentially tank damage for endless amounts of time its exceedingly difficult to kill someone whos unnoting food at the bank jagex have stated that they would rather reward players who think ahead and who can avoid situations where they need to tank at a bank in the first place so i think thats why this delay is in place
2007scape,not_removed,its not when you withdraw food its simply when you open and close your bank you cannot eat or drink pots for secs
2007scape,not_removed,happened to me too
2007scape,not_removed,its disgusting it needs to be fixed
2007scape,not_removed,its not a bug
2007scape,not_removed,only if he follows you world to world purposely harassing you if not then no thus is the life of an ironman on that note im going to go ahead and remove this post this is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing report abuse in game and contact jagex for serious issues
2007scape,not_removed,i believe you can report him for disruptive behavior but i can only see him being banned if he purposely follows you around just to ruin your kills unfortunately there isnt much you can do except hop
2007scape,not_removed,if he follows you from world to world yes if hes simply crashing you because he needs a world no
2007scape,not_removed,i want more social aspects to this game like it used to be these are the players now gl with that
2007scape,not_removed,you choose to restrict yourself lool
2007scape,not_removed,for crashing no
2007scape,not_removed,lol ironmen make a normal account
2007scape,not_removed,nah crashing is an accepted activity as long as its frequency doesnt classify it as harassment suck it up friendo
2007scape,not_removed,if you changed worlds to avoid the player and they follow you then that can be reported for harassment other than that its within the rules
2007scape,not_removed,if he hops to continue to crash you yeah otherwise no you choose to play a mode where if you dont do full dmg to a mob you do not get the loot
2007scape,not_removed,stop whining you chose to be an ironmeme
2007scape,not_removed,deal with it
2007scape,not_removed,competing in a multi zone in an mmo wow thats so bannable get over it and hop lol
2007scape,not_removed,and
2007scape,not_removed,who gives a shit
2007scape,not_removed,its almost like you can enjoy both games
2007scape,not_removed,y r u there too
2007scape,not_removed,did yall not notice the phat booty
2007scape,not_removed,i cant figure out his position on the webcam
2007scape,not_removed,lol that was funny idk why he was blocked
2007scape,not_removed,savage
2007scape,not_removed,its almost like the joke is about matk watching booty streams i bet he puts grilz before xp pathetic
2007scape,not_removed,its a girl and shes laying on her stomach with her legs turned sideways
2007scape,not_removed,yeah mod mat k is a perv lol he watches so many young girl streamers whilst he has a wife and look at mod mat k he looks like a hillbilly with his beautiful arm tattoo
2007scape,not_removed,if you go into the mini game tab and join the shield of arrav clan chat there are people in there that can help
2007scape,not_removed,thank you i had no idea
2007scape,not_removed,kinda makes sense for pvpers but not for pvmers
2007scape,not_removed,maybe hes fighting a ranger who has gmaul
2007scape,not_removed,pvp accounts still should have fire capes torso rfd gloves and whatever else
2007scape,not_removed,for sure but if you are def you can get the reqd pking gear with very low total level and qp requirement
2007scape,not_removed,mining fally hard needs it and if you are at mlm you will earn it soon enough agility again rooftops are what you will be doing and its probably the most used outfit in game lots of times where being weightless is useful fishing this one last i heard high level people talking about isnt worth it for but if you got really luck and it only took an hour itd be worth wc worth it construction the only construction outfit i know of is a cosmetic only one if there is one its not so much about the time saved but about the cost saved so it depends on what your best money maker is
2007scape,not_removed,it depends if you like clues or intend to go for skilling pets most skilling outfits are required for master clue steps angler sucks to get but lumberjack is quite quick probably less than minutes ive never heard of a construction outfit and dont believe there is one you also missed the farming outfit from tithe farm which could be worth it because you get a lot of exp going for the outfit to my knowledge
2007scape,not_removed,anglers isnt worth it unless youre going for post xp however its a clue requirement so its probably worth doing anyway the rest are worth it for sure also when the kourend diary comes out id completely expect farming outfit to be one of the reqs
2007scape,not_removed,tithe farm is pretty brutal imo but i get farm xp at level and which takes minutes so thats up to you i think it was worth it because of the big chunk of xp you get while getting the whole set
2007scape,not_removed,fishing outfit is not worth getting just for fishing however its required for a master clue step so that makes it worth getting if you like clues
2007scape,not_removed,interesting ive heard conflicting things about the woodcutting one taking hours i guess i confused construction outfit with builders outfit and thanks ill add the tithe farm one
2007scape,not_removed,really its possible i had good luck with the lumberjack outfit but i dont think ive ever heard someone say it took hours and no problem
2007scape,not_removed,saw it in the end of the video
2007scape,not_removed,there was an update you can no longer get dupes in the wc outfit it usually takes less than an hour to get now
2007scape,not_removed,can confirm took me minutes the other day just do the easiest path and evade events until you get the lumberjack
2007scape,not_removed,lets take a moment to realize that woox and skill specs are losing to skip option
2007scape,not_removed,why are they showing the votes doesnt that kinda ruin the whole thing
2007scape,not_removed,why is not an option for video content rigged i say
2007scape,not_removed,why did they put skillspecs on the poll wtf
2007scape,not_removed,where can i vote for alison quinn
2007scape,not_removed,man i want to see him win now im getting to a poll booth
2007scape,not_removed,this poll is just nonsense i mean its just a contest of who has the largest audience i watched a few ice poseidon streams i really enjoyed it but sadly he only streams in the middle of the night for europeans so i cant watch his streams which means he has a smaller audience and thus its unlikely he will win
2007scape,not_removed,why is everyone voting for nowadays his streams have just turned to boring ass content
2007scape,not_removed,is the best in general streamer ice is the best entertainer and woox is the best player
2007scape,not_removed,this dude needs to eat and stop smoking crack he looks like shit
2007scape,not_removed,did they completely get rid of the awards through google doc bullerik was having a good run for best member of the community please say it aint so
2007scape,not_removed,get to the poll booth
2007scape,not_removed,i dont care for who you vote for but boaty doesnt deserve to win again
2007scape,not_removed,hes coming back
2007scape,not_removed,srsly boaty whos not even funny and has no content at all kk
2007scape,not_removed,tbh he wants it more not a big ice fan but doesnt really care about winning should go to him
2007scape,not_removed,seems like he was salty i wasnt winning too
2007scape,not_removed,ice lost the moment the voting system was changed to oldshcoolrs most of ice fans dont even play the game anymore or are as active as fans sadly but true jagex made it easier for boeh to win it that way
2007scape,not_removed,they should of just asked for nominations from people and picked who they thought was the best has already won so he doesnt really mind not winning again ice winning is much better publicity for runescape
2007scape,not_removed,how is a friend even eligible for an award after his video on how to hack accounts
2007scape,not_removed,off topic but im disappointed boaty wast on the video maker list his videos are the best way more entertainig than any other rs vid maker i know hes like the most subbed rs streamer doest mean he couldnt be in the video category too
2007scape,not_removed,i really hoped ice would win crazy how got double the votes now doubt ice can win now but who knows
2007scape,not_removed,they said best steamer not most autistic streamer i dunno what hes expecting
2007scape,not_removed,nice popularity contest
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i dont want someone like this representing the runescape community it would be a real shame
2007scape,not_removed,boaty sucks ice poseidon is the best out of these a friend and boaty are boring af
2007scape,not_removed,i know hes an entertainer and all but that isnt very good acting
2007scape,not_removed,good this guy is a fucking poser actor with bipolar issues awful tweaker streams full of pre pubescent racism borderline jokes and spastic outbursts twitch needs to cut this retard off so he is forced to socialize
2007scape,not_removed,this guy has always made me turn off the stream within seconds of checking it out the cringe is so incredibly uncomfortable
2007scape,not_removed,made skillspecs residentsleeper
2007scape,not_removed,lets take the moment to notice that people who are their fans dont vote for them anymore as they wont win at the moment people who like woox or skill specs likely vote and choose between ice or
2007scape,not_removed,woox isnt really even a streamer i voted for him because i enjoy his streams the most out of anyone whenever hes live though he isnt live often
2007scape,not_removed,to be fair both of them are pretty cringeworthy
2007scape,not_removed,you trying to logic disgusting you know thats a bannable offense in some parts
2007scape,not_removed,these votes are being combined with the votes through the which are not visible the reason we decided to do it was for more visualisation on the poll allowing more players to access it and know that its going on hiding the results as a whole would also be good in my opinion not just for this but the system is not set up to handle that we could make changes in game to not display the current votes but the website would need updating and thats not so quick to get work done its still not been updated to reflect the skip question addition although work is progressing on that even with the changes it brings out other issues party clients could start tallying players votes and informing players what the current results are and we really dont want to be in the situation that the results are still visible but theyre not necessarily being provided accurately since a party client wouldnt include every player
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure has that system cant copy them
2007scape,not_removed,because thats the way it is coded and they cantwont hide the numbers
2007scape,not_removed,hi and welcome to my guide
2007scape,not_removed,k thx bye
2007scape,not_removed,i agree that man saved this noob ass so many times during questing
2007scape,not_removed,prob cus hes one of the most consistent streamers
2007scape,not_removed,see paul uiceposeidon
2007scape,not_removed,ice barely plays rs anymore
2007scape,not_removed,he gets more views than boaty thats the opposite of a smaller audience
2007scape,not_removed,as opposed to ice who barely streams osrs after he got famous from pokemon go lol
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure hes a teacher
2007scape,not_removed,he looks like a crack addict but hes the best streamer i dont even really watch his rs streams his pokémon go streams were awesome
2007scape,not_removed,a good run against who the skip question option emily
2007scape,not_removed,why not thats like saying an athlete with a best performing season doesnt deserve to win multiple mvps in a row
2007scape,not_removed,ice poseidon isnt funny though
2007scape,not_removed,google doc votes count too
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i agree ice can make runescape popular again look at how much people he pulled yesterday and not even yesterday overall the special thing about ice is that he offers a variety of entertainment it doesnt matter which games he plays his viewerbase will always follow him if not a new group of viewers will show up an example are the pokémon go streams even the big streamers like soda and lirik told their stream that ice can be a huge streamer of twitch and not runescape
2007scape,not_removed,he did that video to help people learn about account security if you think you can hack a runescape account with the information he shared you wouldnt he uploads runescape content daily and almost had the most subscribers in the entire community which is why hes eligible
2007scape,not_removed,thats the arm thing homie
2007scape,not_removed,he k knew he probably wasnt going to win because is way bigger its kind of sarcastic
2007scape,not_removed,u sure they shouldnt be forcing you to socialize
2007scape,not_removed,triggered
2007scape,not_removed,this clip is also an example of me turning it off very quickly
2007scape,not_removed,only thing skillspecs makes himself is food
2007scape,not_removed,i voted woox even hes not my favourite streamer
2007scape,not_removed,boaty and ice are like trump and clinton of osrs
2007scape,not_removed,woox isnt really even a streamer i voted for him because i enjoy his streams facepalm
2007scape,not_removed,both of them except woox
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the response i feel like for the golden gnome awards a basic poll ingame isnt suitable if votes are going to be visible people will be less inclined to vote for their actual favourite streamervideo maker if they see that they only have of the votes like what would be the point if you know they wont win
2007scape,not_removed,u get my vote for best mod
2007scape,not_removed,sing on that even with the changes it brings out other issues party clients could start tallying players votes and informing players what the current results are and we really dont want to be in the situation that the results are st so ice has no chance to win why not use just the poll votes
2007scape,not_removed,why isnt there a jmod reply in comments flair for this post does it only do it if the comment is a parent comment
2007scape,not_removed,is there anyway to just hide the results for all polls i feel like people being able to see the results might bias any poll
2007scape,not_removed,remove the website option tell party clients to not do it i dont see the problem
2007scape,not_removed,yeah if we hide the votes theyll introduce microtransactions
2007scape,not_removed,they said they can they would judt need to remove website voting which no one uses anyway
2007scape,not_removed,skillspecs and not mr mammal
2007scape,not_removed,most consistent streamer to rage quit after hours
2007scape,not_removed,ive been following skill smorc for like years and for awhile now i stopped watching him a lot because he just sits there with his mic muted and literally never has his facecam on so he just plays music thats not entertaining for the majority idk how has hasnt caught on that people will watch for streamer interaction aka rune crafting hours a day but talking to the chat with facecam on the whole time
2007scape,not_removed,its his most common game lol not to mention henstreamed solely rs for a year and now plays a variety but still is a rs streamer
2007scape,not_removed,his pokemon go streams were legendary its no surprise that it boosted his popularity outside of rs but i dont think hes forgotten the game that made him
2007scape,not_removed,lol if he acts like that in public id prob watch the pokemon ones too
2007scape,not_removed,well nobody was voting via google docs other than the people voting for bullerik so actually he was probably top choices seeing as it was being advertisedlinked on his stream with viewers for a couple days straight and mazs rot salads rot forums as well might actually be why the format changed in fact
2007scape,not_removed,because his content is boring compared to ice poseidon this is a popularity contest and nothing more
2007scape,not_removed,beacause he doesnt care about the prize anymore winning once is something awesome but winning more times will decrease the worth of winning
2007scape,not_removed,best performing season look at ice growth rate from till and come back
2007scape,not_removed,he k knew he probably wasnt going to win everyone knew that already
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,absolute mad man
2007scape,not_removed,i was imagining it to be the hogwarts house cup most of ices fans are naughty schoolboys waiting to be banned and have their vote removed then theres the obvious school poster boy in gryffindor the only reason hufflepuff is famous is because of cedric piggybacked on harrys fame at the triwizard tournament if luna lovegood was to start streaming her stream would be weird half the community would be madly in love with it the other half of the community would wonder how you could watch a stream with so little talking
2007scape,not_removed,tbh thats a good comparison except and ice are not both absolutely awful
2007scape,not_removed,boatys a douche ice is cool tho
2007scape,not_removed,woox isnt really a streamer is a justification for people not voting for him despite having enjoyable streams because they dont consider him a proper streamer even if his streams are very good the rest of the comment was explaining why someone might vote for him despite that
2007scape,not_removed,to teach someone you still vote for who you think deserves to win the point of voting isnt to win its to cast your opinion on what should be done if there isnt enough people for your cause this time try again later
2007scape,not_removed,first votes then eoc
2007scape,not_removed,they already removed website voting a while back lulz
2007scape,not_removed,i think they didnt want to put people in both categories like how is only in the streamer category even though he could easily fit into the video maker one as well same applies to mammal and sparc mac but the other way around
2007scape,not_removed,hasnt played much in recent times and when he does its always too late for eu
2007scape,not_removed,just giving you a reason why people want to vote for also has always been the most famous rs streamer idk why people are so surprised lol
2007scape,not_removed,only thing that made ice was acting like he was retarded and his racist cancer chat
2007scape,not_removed,he does and it was glorious
2007scape,not_removed,yeah he doesnt care you can watch his streams on yt
2007scape,not_removed,i might be wrong but didnt kieren say that it would be merged with the ingame polls and seeing how there were no other options listed im gonna go ahead and say it seems like he was top behind nobody and nobody d
2007scape,not_removed,what do you mean his content is boring hes constantly shouting content so clearly the content is very good
2007scape,not_removed,sorry man but thats just your opinion the same way that the people voting for have the opinion that he isnt boring compared to ice poseidon i like them both and voted for ice but have some grace in losing at least is winning because he is more entertaining to a lot of people you dont have to agree with that for it to be true
2007scape,not_removed,of course it fucking is a popularity contest how the fuck do you think he got popular it sure as fuck wasnt because he just sat at his screen muted and playing rs i watch both both are entertaining for their own reasons clearly more people find entertaining i personally dont but thats their opinion and clearly more people have that opinion so it makes sense that hes more popular how else would you have this decision be made there is no objective way to say who the best streamer is like i seriously dont get what the fuck youre even trying to say
2007scape,not_removed,if his content is boring shouldnt ice be winning by a large margin
2007scape,not_removed,nobody watches streams anyway and i find boatys stream quite good to listen to
2007scape,not_removed,nty devalues my garden gnomes
2007scape,not_removed,still doesnt matter its a fan vote and i completely disagree winning something special like that is always awesome
2007scape,not_removed,never said ice hasnt had crazy growth but let me say it again fan vote what do you think theyre manipulating numbers to let win
2007scape,not_removed,rmadlads
2007scape,not_removed,what
2007scape,not_removed,yeah that makes sense
2007scape,not_removed,wtf barely any watches rs streamers for what theyre streaming they watch it for the personality you think people were enjoying the content when was rcing for hours a day apparently some people do skill specs has the personality and attitude of a potato mr mammal is worlds better imo
2007scape,not_removed,he doesnt play much in europe timezone but out of every game he plays runescape is definitely his most played game
2007scape,not_removed,haha ok edgelord
2007scape,not_removed,i can assure you he was ahead of skill specs if he only pulled in with an ingame poll lmfao the numbers arent currently merged with the google doc numbers for sure as he would be listed in the range easily if they get merged later it doesnt matter as him winning relied on a dark horse asspull d
2007scape,not_removed,he has more than times as many subscribers and twice as many followers if you think that doesnt give him a huge advantage then youre delusional
2007scape,not_removed,boats literally streams resident sleeper content of the time
2007scape,not_removed,ehm no people who are fanboying skill specs and woox are voting for boaty sure some people might still vote woox or skill specs but they dont have a chance of winning as stated before its different groups of people voting for boaty because their streamer of choice is not there mmorpg woox and boaty offer pretty much the same type of amazing content that only rs people like to watch ice poseidon offers something unique that makes people keep watching making him also the only streamer of the rs channel to pull massive views outside rs its logical that those groups that i mentioned earlier are voting for boaty instead of their own streamer of choice even soda and lirik to name a few hold close connections to ice and he said he could become a big twitch streamer i support him because he is entertaining no matter what game he is playing his deadman mode was hillarious and rot documentary was amazing he is also one of the few streamers still streaming lms he can possibly make scape more bigger than it already is
2007scape,not_removed,read my comment again i was aiming for just that i was using that example for something else
2007scape,not_removed,¯ツ¯
2007scape,not_removed,its almost as if it is subjective
2007scape,not_removed,no one wants to watch hours of killing bloodvelds mate why do you think pking gets more views
2007scape,not_removed,well all youre saying to me is he was top with two nobodys and ahead of a third maybe he can get a consolation prize d
2007scape,not_removed,if he has a bigger following he should win thats what the whole point is
2007scape,not_removed,does him having times as many the followers not say something about how many people do find his content entertaining though just try to remember that this isnt that big of a deal at the end of the day and dont turn it into something negative for because he won
2007scape,not_removed,look at the numbers homie its straight statistics jesus fuck you are dumb
2007scape,not_removed,your point being i gave my opinion he gave his
2007scape,not_removed,i mean thats the point all the more reason to include additional options they could have even done a twopart poll the first with quite a few streamers and the second with the highest three or so votegetters from the first
2007scape,not_removed,hundreds of pking streams with a few viewers rcing stream with viewers ice poseidons cooking stream with viewers curtis woodcutting stream with viewers youre right no one cares about the hours of bloodvelds but they care about hours of the streamer
2007scape,not_removed,a lot of ices fans are fans for ice and not what he plays he has a lot of fans that dont play runescape unlike where of his fanbase are rs players
2007scape,not_removed,the fact that has as many subs as many followers is the entire point of the contest he has more subs and more followers because as many people find him entertaining compared to ip i voted for curtis but i knew would win as he has been producing content for the longest and arguably deserves it the most
2007scape,not_removed,hes been streaming times as long as ice
2007scape,not_removed,right with a post like that you arent actually the one who can judge other people to be dumb try better
2007scape,not_removed,your opinion was stated as fact
2007scape,not_removed,that wasnt my point i agree there should be more options he just stated that mr mammal was miles better than skill specs as if it was objective he edited it after he realized it and i appreciate that p
2007scape,not_removed,stop acting a child i literally said skill specs is a better streamer imo than mr mammal cant accept someones opinion seriously reevaluate your life
2007scape,not_removed,of ices following is from runescape
2007scape,not_removed,yeah im completely with you i guess its understandable that people are a bit upset their favourite streamer didnt win i just hate the fact that the people who won are gonna get ragged so hard when theyve done nothing wrong not much you can do though i suppose
2007scape,not_removed,curtis is great im so glad hes done with zulrah though was boring me to death
2007scape,not_removed,and i would say that consistently producing content for a long time should absolutely be considered in the poll
2007scape,not_removed,look at you downvoting you moron thats why my original comment for upvotes and youre sitting at one hold this fucking l you loser people like you dont even know how the fucking downvote button works go back to please
2007scape,not_removed,edited comment youre right there must have been some people who enjoy watching rcing as it offers entertainment like no other and added an imo at the end ty xo
2007scape,not_removed,stop acting a child seriously reevaluate your life yeah and i said mr mammal is better imo i like how you go on the full defensive after i completely shut your argument down with actual facts and even more ironically you tell me to grow up youre either trolling or youre just incredibly stupid
2007scape,not_removed,not even close mate hes branched out into many games and he has a lot of fans that dont play runescape
2007scape,not_removed,are you delusional lol he got over followers from his pokémon go streams
2007scape,not_removed,so would you have preferred it to be more of a most improved kind of award
2007scape,not_removed,no problem dude
2007scape,not_removed,lmao im done grow up
2007scape,not_removed,just runescape followers lol
2007scape,not_removed,im done no one really wanted to hear your opinion anyway but thanks
2007scape,not_removed,lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,we use discord a lot and are a very active clan were not solely pvm but we do it a lot bit of banter too play not online atm but ask a gen to req you to the discord
2007scape,not_removed,so funny hahaa
2007scape,not_removed,maybe just bad luck with the number of herbs you got try to unlock all the herbs patch is something that can help too
2007scape,not_removed,go plant a cactus in al kharid and pick the spines use ring of dueling after every run extra profit per run
2007scape,not_removed,i personally dont like doing ranarrrs as i feel youre really reliant on getting a decent amount of herbs from it i tend to stick to other seeds like toadflax lantadyme or cadantine as their herbs are usually always more than the seed itself so i make a decent profit regardless of how many herbs i get
2007scape,not_removed,yes for an easy everyday moneymaker it is worthwhile you should average much higher than that per run over time sounds like you just had bad luck
2007scape,not_removed,it is worth doing if you want to progress faster with farming you could also do cheap allotments not sure on seed prices but i think sweatcorn would be amazing as the protection in the flower field is pretty much free and guaranteed always use supercompost with higher levels you will surely make more money and always remember it is just a nice side income from low effort
2007scape,not_removed,randalicious says its inefficient
2007scape,not_removed,what everyone else said do poison ivy berries and limpwurt roots as well for some easy cash for another seconds ive probably done about farm exp in herb runs and thats just bad luck with patches and farm cape admittedly ive not profited on maybe or runs ever its all rng but your chances of losing money is low and chances of making a lot of cash is relatively high with a semi decent yield
2007scape,not_removed,you want to hve good teleport farm patches super compost and magic secateurs its not amazing money or anything but its a quick thing that gives decent cumulative profit and xp
2007scape,not_removed,for profit do sweetcorn in allotments limpwurt in flower patches and ranarr in herb patch i only use patches fally catherby and ardy and get per run totally worth i do avantoe or kwuarm though
2007scape,not_removed,with maxfarm cape the green things and all seven patches i make an average of profit at about mins a run runs and i make about so id say its worth doing plus some xp so ya
2007scape,not_removed,make sure to use supercompost where the herbs are not always protected
2007scape,not_removed,oh nice thanks
2007scape,not_removed,supercompost should be used even if the crop is protected as they increase the overall yield
2007scape,not_removed,dedwilsonns super secret recipe to lose weight in notime
2007scape,not_removed,god damn lmao so predictable
2007scape,not_removed,love this meme
2007scape,not_removed,exposed
2007scape,not_removed,i really appreciate all the hard work youve done to help i have learnt so much and its all thanks to you

2007scape,not_removed,did you get the cape
2007scape,not_removed,i got the same man chilled for like hours before i found the courage to attack hahaha
2007scape,not_removed,you have a karils bow on which means you can easily have dealt with the mage there is almost no spawn path that would result in the mage being stuck behind both meleers and even then i still think u can hit the mage past both of them this would have been better if you had it happen a wave earlier where all rangers were stuck and the mage was in the spot where it is now that is when god loves you
2007scape,not_removed,httpimgurcomcjttnad
2007scape,not_removed,zamorak
2007scape,not_removed,god loves all of you

2007scape,not_removed,gz
2007scape,not_removed,yo chad what happened to btw cc
2007scape,not_removed,you shoud use combat or super combat potions not strength
2007scape,not_removed,yoooo its boy chad
2007scape,not_removed,hes kidding
2007scape,not_removed,when you use your alt to farm karma
2007scape,not_removed,wut
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i see a strenght potion
2007scape,not_removed,someone at draynor asked why are there so many people with herblore
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,you have to hit a on
2007scape,not_removed,walk the owner shut it down also got rid of the discord
2007scape,not_removed,you had to get level cabbage to get the cabbage cape
2007scape,not_removed,thats at cabbage picking you dont get capes for
2007scape,not_removed,srentgh
2007scape,not_removed,eyes
2007scape,not_removed,oh i see i need to get one
2007scape,not_removed,you dont get capes for lvl also but this is a lvl cape
2007scape,not_removed,strentgh
2007scape,not_removed,rope
2007scape,not_removed,yes you must pick cabbages each cabbage gives a lvl
2007scape,not_removed,ok maybe not in this game but certainly you have heard of capes on right
2007scape,not_removed,pretty inventive req tbh
2007scape,not_removed,if you want to leave edge you need overheads at least maybe smite too
2007scape,not_removed,do gmaulers even know how to brid
2007scape,not_removed,judging by the stats you listed you are a rusher lol
2007scape,not_removed,freeze once cbow until youre unfrozen dump spec tele right s
2007scape,not_removed,ive never rushed i was going for an edgeville build but ive come to realize edge pking is cancer
2007scape,not_removed,rushers generally have low hp and low range
2007scape,not_removed,ballistas coming out didnt help the cancer either
2007scape,not_removed,id also like it if sire could only be attacked by the person who started the killkilled the respiratory systems most people doing sire use their house to recharge and its kinda shitty when you get crashed by someone after going through the trouble of stunning sire and running around when you see sire standing up that usually means someone has started the kill but no one really gives a shit its just time saved for a crasher it wont be used for griefing much and if it is its not hard to find a new world at all
2007scape,not_removed,i think they made sire work like that on purpose because when you hit a on that transition it also goes to his next phase so i think it is supposed to be that way i dont know for sure but this is how i see it
2007scape,not_removed,sire is broken af
2007scape,not_removed,if they made it work like that on purpose then have him transition without me having to hit him an extra time for dmg
2007scape,not_removed,its just a check for if it already had less than hp to go into the next phase
2007scape,not_removed,you can program it to autotransition then without needing being hit then im not sure if thats possible in oldschool spaghetti code but other games have it already
2007scape,not_removed,youre right buddy im not gonna argue that but you know this is jagex it wont happen or well have to wait for a long time untill they realise or see this post or decide to do something about it lol
2007scape,not_removed,yea true its why i made this just to get it out there again in hopes it gets traction and they see it
2007scape,not_removed,i feel ya
2007scape,not_removed,darude sandstorm
2007scape,not_removed,edit i figured it out and man i feel autistic guess i had to uninstall all previous versions of java and keep only the most recent one for some reason this made the loading screen appear on the browser rather than the download prompt thanks anyways sub
2007scape,not_removed,sit down you fucking hazard
2007scape,not_removed,the reactions too good also these pkers suck
2007scape,not_removed,the amount of failspecs triggered me tho
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck this dude still makes vids i used to watch him back in the day on his turmoil pure man he was hilarious
2007scape,not_removed,expected something lame but its pretty funny tbh
2007scape,not_removed,thank you all so much for the kind words i am so happy that everyone is enjoying the video i will be coming out with part this friday february much love
2007scape,not_removed,this was good
2007scape,not_removed,amazing
2007scape,not_removed,free mystic boiiiiiiii
2007scape,not_removed,laughed so much when there was just like pkers staring at him above the hill waiting also the amount of pkers who just call in their friends when things get a bit dangerous reminds me of the worldstarhiphop fights where they just suddenly call in people to start laying into the dude who was winning
2007scape,not_removed,damnnnn never lold so much hahahaha
2007scape,not_removed,why did the pkers not notice the rune people dont understand that req apparently
2007scape,not_removed,cool video but this guy needs to learn how to gmaul lol
2007scape,not_removed,my boy soft pillow is back
2007scape,not_removed,i thoroughly enjoyed every second of that lol
2007scape,not_removed,howd he hit through prayer so easy
2007scape,not_removed,ustevedeka lmaooooooo
2007scape,not_removed,had me a actually loling guy is a good entertainer for sure
2007scape,not_removed,the dashy of runescape
2007scape,not_removed,fucking hilarious
2007scape,not_removed,cant say i have
2007scape,not_removed,omg i forgot about soft pillow
2007scape,not_removed,this was fucking amazing more pls
2007scape,not_removed,no one expects range
2007scape,not_removed,wtf this shit is cringy as hell plus these comments all look like bots trying to promote his stream
2007scape,not_removed,had no idea this guy still made videos used to love watching him pre eoc
2007scape,not_removed,even if he is autoswitching which he is the way his mouse teleports at parts of the video i can do perfect switches consistently and my mouse doesnt even move in the exact same movement every time like this guy i have of hours nh experience and it is very obvious to me who cares lol he is shit compared to most nhers i play with like hed legit get bodied playing against people like me who are dedicated nhers and dont use auto switchers when im not at school gym studying or with friends i just practice nhing on private servers every chance i get some days hours theres at least dedicated nhers i can think of off the top of my head who i play against regularly every day on different servers that would blow a player like this out of the water hes slow as fuck no fakes no delays no ticks he misses constantly and his character movement is not on the level of a great nher doing simple way switches against clueless players is really not hard i am in the process of making a no honor montage ive been collecting clips for weeks just need to cut and compile them all and i will post it to this subreddit soon when i am finished you will see the massive difference between someone like this who is slow and uses an autoswitcher and someone like me who can switch faster without an autoswitcher and fluidly change my playstyle because im actually doing the clicks manually the thing about using an autoswitcher is he has to use it because he is slow in the brain he just bullies retards who have no clue how to pk on osrs legit wouldnt be able to keep up vs a real nher thats just fact edit sorry for rant nhing is just an art form i am passionate about and its sad seeing shit players like this even getting as much attention as they get mark my words when i release my frag video i will be seen as one of the goat nhers second only to for the time being
2007scape,not_removed,annoying
2007scape,not_removed,this was posted like a week or two ago
2007scape,not_removed,yeah ill be honest the content is good but i personally think the commentary tried too hard to be funny to the point where it wasnt worth watching definitely fun to watch him slap some shitty pkers but hes just trying soooooooo hard to be funny whilst doing it that i feel like its forced
2007scape,not_removed,his constant laughing ruined it
2007scape,not_removed,hes trying way too hard to be funny
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i enjoyed it reminded me of the real tbh
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think you can call any of em pkers they were just going for bots
2007scape,not_removed,gotta start somewhere
2007scape,not_removed,its actually a fault in the gmaul spec if you switch to the gmaul as your target moved away from you you cant spec until you click on them again its really dumb and i dont think any other spec works that way
2007scape,not_removed,yeeboi he just came back to streaming aswell still as fuckin hilarious this man got me through boring recesses in highschool
2007scape,not_removed,right haha
2007scape,not_removed,could be a stolen account now used for botting
2007scape,not_removed,isnt that hard though and i mean if youre going to bot why not do it with better gear
2007scape,not_removed,they were all defense in monk robes basically
2007scape,not_removed,prayer doesnt affect attackdefense rolls only damage roll by and thy were in def with tiny def bonuses anyway
2007scape,not_removed,you havent watched any of his other videos have you
2007scape,not_removed,hes actually just having a good time enjoying himself its nice to see and hilarious to watch
2007scape,not_removed,at first it seemedthat way to me too but then the more i heard him i understood why he talks that way
2007scape,not_removed,nah
2007scape,not_removed,you legit comment on stuff lol gay im not sure youre the arbiter of comedy tbh fam
2007scape,not_removed,so is he pretending to be a bot its been awhile for me
2007scape,not_removed,pking means killing other players regardless of whether theyre being controlled by a bot script or a person
2007scape,not_removed,yeah kind of annoying too because this discourages bot killing
2007scape,not_removed,doest every other spec weapon work like that like with dds it wont just attack automatically after switching from whip to it idk why gmaul should be any different
2007scape,not_removed,not worth doing considering the ban rate
2007scape,not_removed,i think it is meant to be a copypasta no sane person would claim to have thousands of hours of gearswitching experience on osrs fucking insane
2007scape,not_removed,last i checked tbh fam was a couple irony levels lower than lol gay
2007scape,not_removed,yeah
2007scape,not_removed,a bot script is not a player
2007scape,not_removed,thank you mr pedantic but again theyre killing bots not players
2007scape,not_removed,kinda annoying being killed when you arent a bot but wait dont go into the wildy if you dont wanna die
2007scape,not_removed,from estonia we have recesses at every level of education
2007scape,not_removed,here in australia we have recess in high school
2007scape,not_removed,he had a dragon scimitar too lol never have i seen a bot whos done monkey madness
2007scape,not_removed,you made some shit comment like last year that i downvoted go away usewerboy
2007scape,not_removed,they kill players regardless of whether theyre being controlled by a bot script of a person in the case of this video their victim happened to a person controlling the player they have no discretion and dont care whether their target is a person or a bot script
2007scape,not_removed,well im just saying bot killers are often doing a service while making themselves some money back in killing bots was fairly common and other pkers often ignored bot killers right now not many people kill bots because pkers dont care anymore and just kill what evers in sight and if ur just bot killing you arent really geared for a legit fight
2007scape,not_removed,lmao ive had people call me a bot when using a d scimmy and rune plate at drags before
2007scape,not_removed,hmm looking at your comments your only on irony level sorry u cant chill with the big league boys lol
2007scape,not_removed,you dont really know what youre saying do you
2007scape,not_removed,since the wilderness is pretty empty off legit pkers that wants a fair fight you go for pretty much whatever you can see even someone thats not wearing anything can have a mil of gp on him who knows and green dragons is located in the fucking wilderness you kill them for money dont be surprised if anyone kills you for some money and the thrill by doing so call me a douche and downvote me but people cant expect to walk into the wilderness and be safe
2007scape,not_removed,what do you guys have after that
2007scape,not_removed,im in the us and really we didnt particularly have recess in elementary school either it was just part of the lunch break
2007scape,not_removed,no i know its the widlerness and i expect to be killed when i go in the wilderness im just saying killing bot killers is kind of silly because if we have enough green dragon bot killers then dbone price goes up for the normies and green dragon tasks are more profitable because dbone prices go up but if people are killing the bot killers then it kind of discourages punishing the bots but i guess itd take a insane amount of bot killers to make much of a difference in price
2007scape,not_removed,sadness we have sadness after the grade
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but do you guys just have school for hours without breaks
2007scape,not_removed,yep we get a lunch break and thats it gym classes kind of count i guess but its still a class and not everyone has to take it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i want to know too
2007scape,not_removed,yeah at my school wed get minutes between classes includes actually getting to class and a min lunch thats it
2007scape,not_removed,we got minutes between each class a min break and a min start at finish at australia
2007scape,not_removed,yeah we do the actual times can vary but its almost universally hours mins for lunch mins between classes no recess once youre like and gym class is usually optional once you hit high school
2007scape,not_removed,but isnt that a cookin cape u slut
2007scape,not_removed,can you make the image a little bit smaller pls
2007scape,not_removed,no you cant resell them anymore
2007scape,not_removed,you can buy gems now
2007scape,not_removed,quick and fast answer thanks
2007scape,not_removed,hes talking about the bug where you could buy clay packs and sell them back to percy for nuggets effectively you could buy full prospectors for gp they fixed it ages ago
2007scape,not_removed,i wouldnt say bug more of an overlooked feature if anything but no op its been changed
2007scape,not_removed,what
2007scape,not_removed,whats the point of showing part of the clip then jumping ahead seconds to show the loot to hide his autoswitcher lmaooo look at the osb timer on the left same thing at also at he jumps ahead second to hide his autoswitcher for a switch at corp lmfao edit since he made the video private here is another example also the point isnt that using a autoswitcher gives him some sort of advantage or anything the point is if he is willing to do something against the tos for something that little it makes you wonder what else he does
2007scape,not_removed,lmaooo thats so sad only a way switch and he had to use that smh
2007scape,not_removed,mirror
2007scape,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbitqiabgny at you can clearly see this guy is using an autoswitcher to switch gear how is this allowed jagex
2007scape,not_removed,how hard is to click fucking items lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,wow wtf no wonder he does corp all day
2007scape,not_removed,he starts on his gloves and ends on his gloves idk ive never seen someone switch like this before autoswitcher
2007scape,not_removed,auto switching for pvmmuch less for a fucking way lmao welcome to
2007scape,not_removed,so pathetic
2007scape,not_removed,damn pretty sad
2007scape,not_removed,smh
2007scape,not_removed,did anyone save the videos if yes care to reupload
2007scape,not_removed,clicking is hard in rot
2007scape,not_removed,exposed
2007scape,not_removed,autoclicked and keyboard macros very nice
2007scape,not_removed,why is not afrie banned he clearly use some type of auto switcher in the video which is a macro
2007scape,not_removed,ive always been wondering wouldnt it be possible to hook up a keyboard to your computer and use ahk to switch your stuff you just slide your finger across the keyboard and it does all the switching like those guys that drop whole invents of fish at once i mean it would be then but i doubt they would let you do it what do you guys think
2007scape,not_removed,no one cares
2007scape,not_removed,its ahk lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,autoswitch to pvm plz
2007scape,not_removed,wait but ahk is fineso yall are just like witch hunting or is there something im missing
2007scape,not_removed,delete this witch hunt
2007scape,not_removed,why do you care if it doesnt affect your game or really anything
2007scape,not_removed,racist
2007scape,not_removed,why spend time editing that second out if you have nothing to hide
2007scape,not_removed,he turned the video to private hmm kinda suspicious
2007scape,not_removed,he skipped ahead seconds doing an way switch in that time is highly manageable not to mention even if he is using an auto switcher why the fuck would you even care maybe in a pvp situation it would be annoying but there are way better things that you could be complaining about say the gold farmers that have a chin bots in every world hunting
2007scape,not_removed,looking for one too
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,ahk is suprisingly easy to learn and use more people should give it a try nothing is stopping you the thing is free and there are guides on youtube for it now go and train to make rs great again
2007scape,not_removed,every little helps stud are a buncha cunts anyways they crash pretty much anyone at any boss and if u anticrash them they call anticrash on you
2007scape,not_removed,you going to record a video of you clicking times and pressing separate buttons for your ahk script in less than second
2007scape,not_removed,to do this without clicking the mouse like he did youd need to press at least separate keys click move down click move right click move up click move left its possible that its but then why isnt he using his mouse to click and why have the extra hotkey to move the mouse back to the original position its also very fast if it were a
2007scape,not_removed,just make an ahk script for it if you really have to instead of downloading some dodgy program and later complain how you got hacked lol
2007scape,not_removed,ahk doesnt do random very well though maybe if youre good with it it would work fine though
2007scape,not_removed,botting is botting no matter how big or small punishment is deserved
2007scape,not_removed,i love to call people out on shit but what are the odds its not just him going afk to talk to his mates in discord or teamspeak so he edits out the seconds
2007scape,not_removed,hes just roasting him for being shit you are shit if you cant manage a way switch
2007scape,not_removed,the video was cut how would u know hes using mousekeys lmao
2007scape,not_removed,in this video at he skips past his gear swap watch the imbued heart timer why would he skip such a short time if he has nothing to hide
2007scape,not_removed,man thats so much cringe to think there are grown adults waiting around to run in and anticrash runescape bosses on a moments notice step back and think about that for a second
2007scape,not_removed,its not called an anticrash if i crash you and you try to mass up i call a crash and people want to come when you mass that simple
2007scape,not_removed,i miss pso
2007scape,not_removed,what is anticrashing
2007scape,not_removed,its literally how u do darts by mashing ur keyboard its not hard
2007scape,not_removed,you do know that you can set keys to click too right you could easily make a gear switch script that can do a way switch by just sliding your finger across qwertyu afries case still seems pretty shady since he cut it out of the video though lol
2007scape,not_removed,i have a friend who has a key hot keys for rune crafting and slides his fingers quickly across his keyboard each trip and it comes out looking that fast could be similar to this but i doubt it
2007scape,not_removed,they could have something like mousewheel down bound to left click q down w right e up r left and just hit qwer while spinning the mousewheel not sure why they would have the mousemove left at the end though maybe in case they fucked up the first click or something idk its still kinda weird
2007scape,not_removed,how can you tell he didnt click his mouse i just compared my screen using ahk to click and my mouse to click and visually cant see anything different unless you are going off on how fast he swapped gear
2007scape,not_removed,that was mousekeys not botting mate
2007scape,not_removed,the part that is edited out is second in length it is just the gear swap
2007scape,not_removed,ah people without day jobs i see
2007scape,not_removed,this action was performed by a bot please message ufusiongaming for more information and to report bugs gnu terry pratchett
2007scape,not_removed,you can use mousekeys to switch gear like that its not against the rules i dont really understand your point
2007scape,not_removed,they arent at least in pre eoc idk about current pvm clans but basically if a clans big enough you can assume that if youre at bandos soloing and you get crashed there will be other clan members killing bandos on other worlds who are willing to hop and help you out
2007scape,not_removed,what you could word literally any action in rs that way and achieve the same connotation most of the time ppl anticrashing are already at the boss but in diff world others are skilling and take a break from that to help a friend out and be social in an mmorpg so i dont get why you think its so cringy
2007scape,not_removed,youre name is not idiot if i called you one and your friends also in a mass youre that simple
2007scape,not_removed,when tries to crash you and you dont let them crash you
2007scape,not_removed,spam mashing isnt the same as very precise clicks like this video
2007scape,not_removed,i doubt sliding your finger across keys would every be as smooth as what you see in the video
2007scape,not_removed,hitting qwer while spinning the mouse wheel clicks is not going to consistently do perfect swaps
2007scape,not_removed,ah i thought i could hear mouse clicks just before then but that mustve been the song
2007scape,not_removed,it would be incredibly hard to do movement keys while getting a click between them at that speed thats like of a second the only way with ahk you are doing that is having something like qclickwmoveeclickrmove aclicksmovedclickfmove which can be done rapidly
2007scape,not_removed,im a complete noob so could you point out how you know that i cant really tell edit oh the next change meter was still ticking down that is definitely some shady shit
2007scape,not_removed,click four times in a game thats literally all about clicking clearly abandond his job and family to nail that four way wo a doubt
2007scape,not_removed,its night here
2007scape,not_removed,taking minutes to make fun of someone on reddit means i dont have a jobam not enrolled in uni are you in stud unit
2007scape,not_removed,makes no sense lol
2007scape,not_removed,they didnt do key inputs its that second
2007scape,not_removed,if he is just using mousekeys why is he cutting out that part of his video
2007scape,not_removed,okay okay fair enough i guess thats better than the initial situation i had playing in my head lol
2007scape,not_removed,oh god back in the day pvmadness we had like people on at any given time i think we had an anti crash war at bandos with clan members yeah some clans dont fuck around
2007scape,not_removed,i am name
2007scape,not_removed,yes it is dumb fuck
2007scape,not_removed,now that you say it that actually does sound like a bad idea
2007scape,not_removed,you see his gear it switches
2007scape,not_removed,yes giving a fuck about others means you have to much time on your hands kiddo
2007scape,not_removed,how do you know its not hard to do key inputs in a second if you have everything set up properly
2007scape,not_removed,if that were the case hed just use a variable coordinate x pixels
2007scape,not_removed,theres literally nothing else he could be doing other than switching with ahkmousekeys which is allowed
2007scape,not_removed,i mean i was in pro s only antis could get pretty big but have of us with claws steel titans and spec restores and whoever was crashing would leave within a couple kills
2007scape,not_removed,the video shows clear inputs and not any type of spam
2007scape,not_removed,same theory but bind directions to keys and you would just swipe the keys qwertyuiop
2007scape,not_removed,the time the video is cut doesnt show that exactly though the only indicator would be the very top where it shows the next change meter counting down still otherwise it could have been seconds later for all we know
2007scape,not_removed,ok show me a video of it happening then
2007scape,not_removed,yeah better save the second of every ones time with the zulrah death animation
2007scape,not_removed,yeah oh crap i cant remember the other clan names but we pretty much had anti wars at every boss imaginable its totally unrealistic to have max people with claws spec restores and shit at bandos but it was a dick measuring contest at that point
2007scape,not_removed,what else could he be doing besides ahkmousekeys
2007scape,not_removed,i mean the top were and pso and there was one other that i cant remember but the rest were kind of irrelevant
2007scape,not_removed,using an autoclicker
2007scape,not_removed,why is this so hard to understandthere literally no other reason for him to cut that part out other to hide something because he only skipped like second of the clip
2007scape,not_removed,pso and were the kiddies whod play in their play pen at gwd otg and pid were the real deal
2007scape,not_removed,yeah those were them and pvmadness we ran the next fcs
2007scape,not_removed,did you not see you can clearly see its mousekeys
2007scape,not_removed,look at in the vid hes using mousekeys in a legal way
2007scape,not_removed,i miss pid
2007scape,not_removed,pvm clans real deal wrong
2007scape,not_removed,lol no name clans
2007scape,not_removed,could quite easily be ahk these lines here grabs your current mouse position mousegetpos mousex mousey mousemove getx gety and then you can use that to go back to the same position again ive used it for some basic color bots on games
2007scape,not_removed,what exactly is broken
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,damn any repeats
2007scape,not_removed,nice man congratz
2007scape,not_removed,might be time to buy a lotto ticket
2007scape,not_removed,is barrows any good gold per hour wise anymore
2007scape,not_removed,all dupes sadly
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,hahahah i never noticed them thats soo good dovydas nudes wins it for me
2007scape,not_removed,good his streams are awful and promote a dangerous lifestyle stopedating
2007scape,not_removed,thats so clever
2007scape,not_removed,why the hell does he have a mil cash stack on him what was he repairing
2007scape,not_removed,a dangerous lifestyle lmao stop being such a pussy all he does is occasionally stay awake his streams are pretty shit tho
2007scape,not_removed,it is dangerous hes doing borderline stuff people have died doing wouldnt surprise me if by next year he ends up with a blood clot in his heart for sitting to long he might once day do some crazy stream
2007scape,not_removed,hey dont you try and argue with the reddit doctors
2007scape,not_removed,there were cases people have died in internet cafe for prolong period of gameplay not to mention its harmful for the eyesight in the long run
2007scape,not_removed,you could be walking and get hit by a car i mean thats doing something people have died doing in fact why does anyone do anything people have died doing before everyone should just wrap themselves in bubble wrap but wait i actually heard someone died doing that may aswell just kill ourselves before we die anyway
2007scape,not_removed,thanks reddit doctor
2007scape,not_removed,well i am working on a bachelor in nutrition science i think my knowledge of the human body is above average
2007scape,not_removed,i swear have they never gone on a bender with their mates and stayed up all weekend what mrnosleep does is pretty healthy by those standards
2007scape,not_removed,most cases are people who were dehydrated and didnt eat which caused a death related to their heart
2007scape,not_removed,what a great comparison seems like i was wrong its totally healthy to stay up for hours playing video games and its not like people have died by doing that before
2007scape,not_removed,logic would live my life by that
2007scape,not_removed,youre welcome heres your prescription medication take it once a day
2007scape,not_removed,baddassoverherejpg
2007scape,not_removed,sarcasm is missed on these threads have you never stayed up for a few days in your life i actually feel sorry for you if you havnt
2007scape,not_removed,im not trying to come off as a badass all im saying is that my knowledge on the subject is above average besides you dont have to be a doctor or a med student to know that staying up for hours isnt dangerous gave you an upvote out of pure sympathy since thats what youre obviously trying to achieve
2007scape,not_removed,right his life is clearly incomplete if he hasnt spent multiple days doing nothing but playing games without sleeping
2007scape,not_removed,bet ive missed out on sooo much if i havent had a hour session of rs right
2007scape,not_removed,its not dangerous at all if done properly lol internet points in good one
2007scape,not_removed,where did i say playing games
2007scape,not_removed,i never said playing games ive never stayed up for that long to play on a game but ive stayed up from fridaysunday plenty of times at festivals or going out then going to a party for a few days great times never seen anyone die either surprising i know because not sleeping is deadly af
2007scape,not_removed,if done properly please elaborate on that
2007scape,not_removed,well lets see if youre at festivals then more than likely youre eating well plus up and moving getting blood flow not sitting for days straight
2007scape,not_removed,stretching occasionally and keeping hydrated decent food instead of using energy drinks is enough for nothing dangerous to happen to a healthy person with no heartmedical problems
2007scape,not_removed,so going to the doctor after every healthy stream is normal do you know what melatonin is and what its function is in the body endocrinology is fantastic btw
2007scape,not_removed,when did i imply that youd need to go to the doctor l he just needs to stay hydrated eat properly and stretch unless he has some heart condition itll be fine
2007scape,not_removed,were talking about mr no sleeps hour scaping arent we well hes been to the doctor about it a couple times and he says he does not have any medical problems regarding his heart look up what melatonin is and how it works
2007scape,not_removed,add a spinner bonus point chance and im in
2007scape,not_removed,then bots will just be programmed to do more damageright
2007scape,not_removed,good idea but it isnt qol
2007scape,not_removed,its nice to incentivize non afk but it should be all non afk just because someone is protecting the knight doesnt mean someone dpsing portals should be rewarded more both are important
2007scape,not_removed,well if theyre programmed to damage the monsters attacking the void knight or portals is that a bad thing bots are going exist whether we like it or not
2007scape,not_removed,well then give people incentive for damaging npcs that are attacking the void knight possibly if we can reward both types of players for playing the game efficiently then its a winwin situation
2007scape,not_removed,sorry about lsu though
2007scape,not_removed,roll tide graduated last year
2007scape,not_removed,aye lmao i go to selu grats
2007scape,not_removed,nice grinding out drops and finally getting them is so nice next up slayer helm
2007scape,not_removed,gigem aggies you coming down to see the lsu vs texas am game on thanksgiving rip to the arkansas razorback in the comments this years game was good tho
2007scape,not_removed,go gata
2007scape,not_removed,shhhhh this is a library
2007scape,not_removed,woo pig sooie
2007scape,not_removed,roflcopter xd
2007scape,not_removed,grats mate geaux tigers rofl but grats i should be graduating next year but i went to rehab lmao
2007scape,not_removed,brother of mine is at am getting his masters after he finished his aerospace engineering degree gig em man
2007scape,not_removed,are you trapped in
2007scape,not_removed,relax mate put the gun downonly a jokey wokey
2007scape,not_removed,it wasnt created to spite pures but was certainly kept in the game to spite pures
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure theres a warning that says you will get xp in combat stats for it though
2007scape,not_removed,it gives xp in attack strength defense range and mage if the xp was removed for defense how is this fair to obby pures defense pures pures who dont train melee melee only pures mage but no range pures and so on maybe if you limit yourself you have to deal with these limitations
2007scape,not_removed,there is at least a warning now also people tend to vote to spite pures because of the people that constantly vote no until pures can have addy gloves or theres some arbitrary pvp update
2007scape,not_removed,removing the exp devalues my ultimate hardcore headmountingonly ironman pure
2007scape,not_removed,thats a genies worth of exp im not gonna miss out on because you want to limit yourself
2007scape,not_removed,wow its like setting arbitrary restrictions on yourself will somehow limit what youre able to do in game
2007scape,not_removed,f
2007scape,not_removed,pure have to play around the game
2007scape,not_removed,itt people complaining about pures while pures complain about nonpures
2007scape,not_removed,pures are expected to play around the rules dont expect to be able to do everything on a pure thats what a main is for
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,im not a pure and i do t gaf but the way i see it no one is gonna unsubscribe if this gets implemented as a fix however people may unsub if they put it on and ruin their account
2007scape,not_removed,thats so unfair and doesnt make sense at all
2007scape,not_removed,so what youre saying is that by restricting yourself in how you play the game you find yourself restricted from doing certain things who wouldve thought next thing i know youre going to tell me that its unfair that ironmen cant trade items with other players or use the ge
2007scape,not_removed,i think all of them do cant confirm ive only done couple trophies
2007scape,not_removed,we do it for the lulz
2007scape,not_removed,mounting a head would be a cool way to max all combat stats con tbh
2007scape,not_removed,because the community hates pures and skillers and love to scream hur you choose to restrict yourself because features should definitely be locked for certain players just because they play the game differently
2007scape,not_removed,def xp rip my pure
2007scape,not_removed,complaining about getting free xp kids these days
2007scape,not_removed,oh never knew that is awesome if you limit yourself then who gives a fuck
2007scape,not_removed,im a zerker and i upvote this
2007scape,not_removed,i like this
2007scape,not_removed,if youre a pure you limit yourself its arbitrary and stupid but its rule and will never change
2007scape,not_removed,i like my defence xp nty
2007scape,not_removed,dude as a pure youre not allowed to do that because reasons thats all you need to know and no i wont tell you the reasons i totally promise theres reasons but im not gonna tell you
2007scape,not_removed,it was definitely kept to spite pures and serves purpose it should be removed especially since its skilling not combat related
2007scape,not_removed,fuck pures
2007scape,not_removed,removing that xp would be xp waste why vote for that
2007scape,not_removed,want to abuse poorly balanced cb lvl formula suffer
2007scape,not_removed,pures chose to limit themselves as long as it happens to other pures than me or you thats just less competition
2007scape,not_removed,its not about spite its about principal im somebody who would in an ideal world have absolutely updates to the original rerelease of osrs no ge no scroll wheel camera no nothing but i recognise that without some of these large scale quality of life upgrades that make the game more appealing from a general usability sense the game would surely die this is not one of the aforementioned updates and therefore i dont want it to be changed
2007scape,not_removed,that was so funny haha i dont think it was even close to passing
2007scape,not_removed,why would they spite pures thats how the game was made why would they change it because some people refuse to level defense pures didnt exist when the xp was put there in the place you make the choice to restrict yourself so thats what it really comes down to lol every pure downvotes this ha
2007scape,not_removed,you still cant mount the kq heads for the desert elite diary
2007scape,not_removed,iirc they polled remove the def xp and not remove all the xp so some people like me voted to keep it
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think hes mad it gives xp hes mad it so random like why on earth would that give xp no one would check that thus mounting it could ruin an account
2007scape,not_removed,lets pretend thats the reason it didnt pass
2007scape,not_removed,patethic attempt at trying to justify why people voted no everyone voted no out to spite pures because no one liked them including me
2007scape,not_removed,how on earth do you obtain the heads if you are only allowed to mount
2007scape,not_removed,arbitrary you dont pk do you
2007scape,not_removed,prayer bonus who gives a fuck wait it will benefit pures vote no or youre not a pvmer
2007scape,not_removed,could say the same about ironman accounts yet they have things made to benefit them all the time
2007scape,not_removed,i know the hand gives slay and con xp like if i recall correctly the other slayer drops should do similar its just boss heads i think
2007scape,not_removed,thats what a main is for use your pure for what pures are made for and you wont run into these problems
2007scape,not_removed,but getting the head is combat related
2007scape,not_removed,and fuck your raids rewards
2007scape,not_removed,do you even believe what you write yourself i love spiting pures as much as the next guy but can we at least please accept that this is what were doing lol
2007scape,not_removed,construction was released in the middle of you dont think pures existed before then get out when did you honestly start rs
2007scape,not_removed,pures didnt exist when construction came out pretty sure i was a pure at the time
2007scape,not_removed,its not about limiting yourself in this case more about the number of people who accidently ruined their account because doing construction gives def xp for whatever reason
2007scape,not_removed,downvoted not a pure
2007scape,not_removed,staying at exactly exp is just a meme that xp wont add anything significant to your combat level
2007scape,not_removed,well you still need defence to even complete the hard diary so theres that
2007scape,not_removed,def pures cant finish the hard diary anyway would be the minimum dream mentor required
2007scape,not_removed,no u
2007scape,not_removed,if the vote to remove it had passed though it would make it more likely for a future poll to remove the other xp for different accounts builds
2007scape,not_removed,they added a warning that says youll gain def xp if you mount it after this failed to pass
2007scape,not_removed,because the kbd uses all attack styles
2007scape,not_removed,you cant ruin a pure account any more than it already is
2007scape,not_removed,low effort troll edit evidently enough effort for this sub nice one
2007scape,not_removed,recoils
2007scape,not_removed,i lose exp you lose a head on the wall no one is ever gonna see i wouldnt mind if they made it so you had a choice but at the end of the day you knew what you were getting yourself into
2007scape,not_removed,oh look another guy who is limiting himself is crying because most people dont want the game to be catered to puresironmen
2007scape,not_removed,defense stops you attacking other players
2007scape,not_removed,even though the price of them would have risen and been better profit for pvmers
2007scape,not_removed,ironman is an official game mode being a pure is not it is a players choice and a poor one in my opinion i dont know why someone would deliberately limit their account but to each their own
2007scape,not_removed,you can get it with def though
2007scape,not_removed,it took polls to pass the agility bottlenecks and to pass changing camera with the scroll button because people wanted to keep the game as it was in i wouldnt put it past them lol
2007scape,not_removed,obviously how dare he
2007scape,not_removed,pures existed before construction came out
2007scape,not_removed,pures existed before construction came out
2007scape,not_removed,well it takes xp to hit level so xp will level you up to level at least which has an effect on your combat level
2007scape,not_removed,oh
2007scape,not_removed,which diaries are even worth doing on pures
2007scape,not_removed,wow do you have any more cracking jokes from cc
2007scape,not_removed,you are a mounting only ironman which means you cant engage in activities other than mounting so its not about using recoils or fighting it u cant do it because these ironman rules doesnt allow you to and if it came to that you would have to get a ring of recoil first which is abit of work too which makes it impossible on an ultimate hardcore headmountingonly ironman pure
2007scape,not_removed,and why the fuck do u need that exp if youre already jesus fuck what the hell
2007scape,not_removed,its less efficient to mount it for the xp than just training lol
2007scape,not_removed,i think the bigger problem is they dont warn you about the exp its extremely random to get experience from it it doesnt make sense it just happens the exp is fine not a big deal just needs to maybe have a little popup that says hey youre about to get this xp are you sure you want to do this otherwise at the end of the day they had no idea what they were getting themselves into
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i never understood why this didnt pass it was an update that benefited everyone
2007scape,not_removed,being a pure is way bigger than being an ironman tbh not saying its harder or anything but its been around way longer as for you dont know why they would limit their account if you go out and fight them in the wild youll wonder why your account is so limited in pk ability and unable to beat them ever
2007scape,not_removed,people dont really acknowledge that just a giant pvmer circle jerk on osrs these days pre eoc everybody got along as a community shame its not the case now we could see alot more cool accounts
2007scape,not_removed,not significantly pmus you get a warning so there shouldnt be a problem
2007scape,not_removed,wilderness elite is the only one that a pure can actually finish probably worth getting whatever step lets you do custom portal teleports and maybe the dark crab fishing if youre so inclined all the other rewards are pretty sub par since anything decent is locked behind the hardelite perks
2007scape,not_removed,he mounted kbd duh
2007scape,not_removed,because then i can jerk my dick off to that xp number duh
2007scape,not_removed,why the fuck do you need to keep your defence at
2007scape,not_removed,they do warn you
2007scape,not_removed,the reason is literally just fuck pures for some reason the community absolutely despises pures and refuses to let them have any kind of changes that might have some positive effect on them usually ends up with the excuse they chose to limit themselves but then theyre all for ironmen and skillers having things changed to make them able to do things bit of a rant but the community is so hypocritical when it comes to pures
2007scape,not_removed,if it benefits pures too then im fine with not having it so they cant have it lol
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i get that people make pures for pking low levels because they cant handle max fights but this game isnt all about pking people can do whatever they want on their account but the game wasnt designed for pures it was designed for main accounts that are rounded in all levels it doesnt matter if pures existed before ironmen theyre an unofficial unsupported game mode and i throughly disagree with you when you say that being a pure is bigger than being an ironman for a number of reasons the most relevant reason is that ironmen are a challenge and have of things you can and have to do to progress while pures are usually made for a single reason and other than pking itself poccesses very little challenge theyre even funded by the owners main pures are like the angry year olds of os to me they limit themselves and then complain that the limits that they agreed to are in place target weaker people for easy money and just contribute very little to the rest of the game this is coming from someone who only uses the wild for clues and bosses but i think my points still stand
2007scape,not_removed,everybody got along preeoc seriously
2007scape,not_removed,we could see alot more cool accounts lmao like what the amazing kalphitequeenheadinhouse pure
2007scape,not_removed,gotcha thanks just stared playing again about a week ago on an old pure
2007scape,not_removed,what are u saying
2007scape,not_removed,to have a lower combat level and higher stats its a low defence stat based build while any experience point beyond def is absolutely useless im not a pure ask pures why im just stating its simply dumb to say my exp genie lamp
2007scape,not_removed,because the people that vote no are still butthurt that they died at green dragons to a pure because theyre too stupid to tp out when they see a white dot lmao
2007scape,not_removed,your points dont stand at all i dont see pures saying i wish we could use rune armor i wish we could use bandos this complaint was literally the game doesnt tell you that you randomly get defence experience for this random thing that has nothing to do with gaining combat stats whatsoever and can potentially ruin an account think of it like what if doing a random thing ingame such as pking another player on an ironman immediately without warning removed your ironman status people would be livid thats very similar to this obviously pures have limited themselves to playing certain parts of the game thats fine what i dont understand is why people think that their accounts should be ruined off of random pointless stuff it all comes down to people who dont pk at all get salty that a pure killed them when they were killing dragons or clue hunting in the wilderness and they want to get revenge on them in a way that doesnt involve having to kill them because they cant im all for keeping pures limited but i think the game should also warn you before ruining your account that youve spent months on its extremely simple add an youre about to get experience in the following stats are you sure will make a main spend an extra second on their account career and in return will keep pures from potentially ruining their accounts
2007scape,not_removed,he mounted kbd
2007scape,not_removed,maybe i want the last thing i do for in a skill is mount a kbd head we dont cater to pures
2007scape,not_removed,there should be a confirmation yes but its also and mainly the fault of the person who mounted the stuffed head the xp information is on the wiki its unacceptable to be ignorant in the age if information and it doesnt give a warning because the game is not built around pures or with pures in mind its supposed to be that way so why would they need to warn you you were getting xp if youre in a game where leveling up is part of the game pures should have to find out everything that gives def xp and avoid it on their own if not a main is always a great option
2007scape,not_removed,who and why is it relevant to whats being said in this context
2007scape,not_removed,i want the last thing i do is this sentence ends the discussion go fuck yourself youre saying some absurd shit to force ur point jesus christ bye keep being mentally handicapped
2007scape,not_removed,again if something similar happened to ironmen it would be gamebreaking people would throw a fit and it would be patched quickly people dont like pures and they literally vote against anything that benefits them whatsoever even if it doesnt harm anyone else in the game people dont like pures plain and simple
2007scape,not_removed,he mounted kbd did you get it that time
2007scape,not_removed,i want the last thing i do for in a skill is mount a kbd head what i said was a sentence what you said was i want the last thing i do is dumbass lol
2007scape,not_removed,ill admit that i dont like pures i think the idea of them is flawed however i want pures to be able to exist if they choose to and do what they want to within the limits of the game that they imposed on themselves when they chose to be a pure
2007scape,not_removed,no doesnt make sense in this context idk who you are talking about or how it has any relevance to whats being said
2007scape,not_removed,but in that same mindset nothing should ever be changed to benefit an ironman because they set out to play ironman mode at that exact moment they made their account if something doesnt work for them it was their fault for limiting themselves im all for helping out ironmen if something is fucked or broken but im also for helping out pures mains skillers whatever the hell else people want to make as long as it doesnt harm anyone else helping pures not ruin their account doesnt harm anyone letting pures wear rune armor hurts people who fight pures so they dont get that its common sense
2007scape,not_removed,bruh he means he boned kbd not skullfucked sick fuck
2007scape,not_removed,mount only ironman was a bad joke learn to laugh next time kid
2007scape,not_removed,hahahaha good enough of course it was a bad joke and so was my comment its similar to the tile squares north of the northwest side of lumbridge church mage pure ultimate ironman hes pretty fucked too because he ran out of the runes he spawned with so im just wondering how this guy will go about getting heads when hes so limited it makes it impossible
2007scape,not_removed,my god people will argue about literally anything
2007scape,not_removed,chill bruh lifes gọnna be okay
2007scape,not_removed,defintely
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,whos on screen
2007scape,not_removed,how did he get hacked step on everything is something he had probably enabled and i dont think that jagex doesnt flag accounts of streamers that big and just lets ppl recover them
2007scape,not_removed,how big of a loser do you have to be irl and how bad do you have to hate your life to spend all your time on rs ragging people something that benefits you in no way some ppl smh lol
2007scape,not_removed,its just stupid that someone can instantly has control over an account when they hijack your email they can then instantly remove the authenticator change email change password they should really ask for a new security question or prove that you are the owner by logging in with a secondary account that is linked to your main just add something else other than only the email
2007scape,not_removed,update
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know who is but good job
2007scape,not_removed,nser in who ragged skiddler in edge and so skiddler got him banned on all of his accounts
2007scape,not_removed,he flashed his email on stream by mistake
2007scape,not_removed,httpstwittercomskiddler square this message was created by a bot
2007scape,not_removed,your girlfriend was a hottie what was her name helen cox right
2007scape,not_removed,id say hes the least scummy after boaty in the aoaa team
2007scape,not_removed,not everyones a reddit cunt who hates every streamer edit theyre friends stop being so angry and calling them leeches he wants them to grow into bigger streamers thats what friends do he wouldnt be supporting them otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,arent all of them leeching off of lol
2007scape,not_removed,elaborate
2007scape,not_removed,he also ragged him on and ddosed his stream off more than once
2007scape,not_removed,mod infinity said theres a criteria for recovering accounts and knowing simple info like email isnt enough to get u recovered
2007scape,not_removed,log in or email connected to account
2007scape,not_removed,his account protection was still abysmal if all someone needs to know is his email login name lmao no pin either deserved
2007scape,not_removed,ns is nonstop so hes a nonstop ragger nsers are people who rag each other in to see who lasts longer the person who logs first loses and is therefore not as much of a ragger as the person who cleared them these people will rag each other for hrs but im pretty sure most of them just account share lol
2007scape,not_removed,mod infinity also said the account was shared so thats that
2007scape,not_removed,true but youve got to think what you can get with just an email its not enough to hack someone but you can use it to get more information
2007scape,not_removed,most streamers are pretty thoroughly doxxed not too hard to dig up some personal information on many of the front page osrs streamers
2007scape,not_removed,ive been hacked from someone who only knew my email
2007scape,not_removed,but you know a lot of stuff about most streamers
2007scape,not_removed,completely unrelated buto have you ever streamedconsidered streaming would be cool seeing you play like accs at once lol might be shitty for your merches tho
2007scape,not_removed,he flashed his login when he was relogging so yeah i assume
2007scape,not_removed,he has two step authentication on both his email and his runescape account the guy that hacked him used his email to recover his account and get rid of the two step authenticator id say its jagexs fault for making it apparently easy to get into somebodys account editing not to mention being able to remove somebodys authenticator like that immediately seems a little odd right his account was compromised within minutes after he logged out this could have been avoided if jagex required a wait time to remove the authenticator like removing a bank pin so he would have noticed something fishy before he lost everything
2007scape,not_removed,well my right hand sir has been inside your misses nerd
2007scape,not_removed,til there are even worse people that cxers in runescape
2007scape,not_removed,there are even bots for thatthere was one in cw white portal testing always ragging the ppl on the list
2007scape,not_removed,aka who has the least responsibility and social life
2007scape,not_removed,im ragger
2007scape,not_removed,yea i have streamed in the past might stream again in the future but i am not sure if streaming is my thing
2007scape,not_removed,he was confirmed to be account sharing with others check the top post on the sub atm
2007scape,not_removed,did he have twofactor authentcation on both his email and osrs account did he have a bank pin im genuinely curious
2007scape,not_removed,thats bullshit you cant simply recover an account with basic details my account got locked once for moving and they made problems just because i didnt have some old card number yet everything else was correct either all of his info was easily available which it shouldnt be database leak or his email protection wasnt good enough that gmail let the hacker in unlikely if he has step gmail you need to have email access to remove authenticatorget into the account obviously i think jagex should make a delay but this wasnt a case of jagex giving away his account from personal experience i know that you need to get pretty much everything correct in the recovery form in order to get the account back
2007scape,not_removed,if he had two factor authentication on his email then how did the hacker use that email to reset the runescape authenticator
2007scape,not_removed,he was account sharing his friends hacked his account
2007scape,not_removed,lmao fuck your self cx
2007scape,not_removed,im a cxer and im perfectly reasonable and im not a terrible person or even close i respect ice poseidon and i enjoy his streams but i dont condone racism or hating on ed or disrupting eds restaurant
2007scape,not_removed,he was account sharing the hack came from the people he was sharing with
2007scape,not_removed,link
2007scape,not_removed,see what i mean
2007scape,not_removed,same cx
2007scape,not_removed,if you do not condone racism youre not a cxer
2007scape,not_removed,boys i found one
2007scape,not_removed,oh cool
2007scape,not_removed,link
2007scape,not_removed,i like to think im a cxer ive been subbed to ice for almost a year now
2007scape,not_removed,no lol youre wrong not to mention most of the people typing trihard and kfc arent being racist theyre memeing
2007scape,not_removed,k
2007scape,not_removed,youre doing it for me
2007scape,not_removed,even the trolls who make twitch accounts to spam the actual racist shit wouldnt do anything irl lmao
2007scape,not_removed,but thats the sad bit youre not man enough to admit to that shit unless youre anon
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt say i supported it anyone who is racist is a pussy especially when they can only do so in a twitch chat but thats just the truth the people who make accounts to spam kill in chats would never say that to someones face lmao
2007scape,not_removed,sand crabs with iron knives or steel darts
2007scape,not_removed,kill things with a bow
2007scape,not_removed,afking tzhaarcave ph and you end up with some nice cash use a rune crossbow with mithbroad bolts
2007scape,not_removed,cannon and cbow ogres
2007scape,not_removed,nightmare zone
2007scape,not_removed,slayer
2007scape,not_removed,kalphite workers with a cannon or yaks with darts both are over per hour
2007scape,not_removed,mith darts are cheaper than iron knives right now just use mith darts or iron knives
2007scape,not_removed,i trained and did not even got drop lol
2007scape,not_removed,ah didnt know thank you
2007scape,not_removed,that is really unlucky haha
2007scape,not_removed,sorry for the shitty paint attempt lol no photoshop on this computer so failed cropping this is a personal best for me speedrunning ratcatchers got lucky and only got caught once in the mansion part of the quest so this was nearly a perfect run d
2007scape,not_removed,cool dude u must be good at quests i hate them
2007scape,not_removed,starting from a fresh account and using a lot of the supplies i got i made about i used coins to make planks for construction though for memes sake im an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,honestly it depends on your other skills i did here with nearly base stats on everything else and didnt make a lot maybe mil post nerf made mil before the nerf so total mil bit take it as is i wish i would of finished before the nerf
2007scape,not_removed,iirc about should take you about hours so roughly hr idk that seems high i think its realistically closer to
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know the numbers but i dont see any point to train firemaking a different way once you hit unless ofc you wanted to get the fastest xp burning redwoods after
2007scape,not_removed,there is no accurate answer to this because your loot scales depending on your other levels such as fishing herblore etc
2007scape,not_removed,cheers
2007scape,not_removed,its a popularity contest for something that doesnt change or hurt the game in any way let them have fun with it i say
2007scape,not_removed,well then jagex shouldve never rigged it by making it an in game poll
2007scape,not_removed,jagex double standard half of the people who watch ice dont even play osrs anymore and therefore unable to vote the moment had some competition they decided to add it to the ingame poll
2007scape,not_removed,i see no harm in what he is doing
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but screaming content every seconds doesnt actually mean you have good content either
2007scape,not_removed,youre making a post complaining about someone campaigning for a plastic gnome give it a break dude who gives a fuck
2007scape,not_removed,hes not forcing anyone to vote or to vote for him he did nothing wrong
2007scape,not_removed,i feel it should be reasonable to expect when voting for anything the only thing that should define the outcome is the amount of votes only it is expected that if something is given in reward for favourable voting creating bioss
2007scape,not_removed,i mean its a competition all the streamers have the opportunity to campaign for themselves with ingame osrs events like drop parties if they wish its not even buying votes really very few people will actually get any loot from the drop party its more so just a publicity stunt that brings attention to voting and his stream no different than holding any other kind of event that gets people to gather and reminds them to vote while doing it of players that are swayed to vote for him because of the drop party wont get anything out of it but simply vote for him because it was a fun event and reminded them to vote for him at the same time
2007scape,not_removed,uxalchs
2007scape,not_removed,unfortunately weve come to a time where its no longer and the rs community is infected with year old fanboys spamming trihard and supporting a streamer that fakes who he is feelssuperfrickinbadman
2007scape,not_removed,i salute your bravado in kicking the hornets nest known as with a thread although well put togetherworded that voices against one of the more popular streamers at the time this thread will hit a few ears but i feel the majority of the responses will be as you stated just a fanboy take an upboat
2007scape,not_removed,he cries for viewsvotes
2007scape,not_removed,get your panties out of that tight wedgie bro
2007scape,not_removed,hope he doesnt kill himself if he loses
2007scape,not_removed,hes not gonna win who cares
2007scape,not_removed,yeah they should campaign for themselves why not
2007scape,not_removed,money is paper lmao
2007scape,not_removed,in fairness though boaty has said that a he doesnt want to win the gnomes and b doesnt stream the best content just whatever hes doing ice is causing fake drama about it because his viewers just gobble that shit up and will spam it for the next month i doubt he actually cares
2007scape,not_removed,he usually says it sarcastically because what he is streaming at the time isnt good content he also copies the chat because theyre the ones who say it first
2007scape,not_removed,barely staying above upvotes knew i was kicking a hornets nest but i thought id at least make an effort
2007scape,not_removed,well isnt that what the us presidential election is all about its the same thing lol
2007scape,not_removed,freedom is slavery
2007scape,not_removed,money also holds value in society a plastic gnome filled with sand is worthless maybe you ppl should find something real to complain about
2007scape,not_removed,ice doesnt even need the runescape category anymore hes the winner at the end of the day
2007scape,not_removed,youre whining about fucking nothing
2007scape,not_removed,except one is leader of the free world and one is for a plastic gnome but essentially yea
2007scape,not_removed,giving money to voters to sway votes is still illegal in elections sure big spenders usually gets elected but thats money spent towards advertising rather than into the pockets of voters either way my argument isnt just about ice or the golden gnome but the idea of being able to buy votes to sway results regardless of the type of poll it is example when raid armor is being polled can top streamers do drop parties and say vote yes and ill drop more in my opinion this undermines integrity of polls in general
2007scape,not_removed,it gives the person awarded a very good prestige
2007scape,not_removed,says you voted for boaty and for some reason is hating on people cause they want ice to win
2007scape,not_removed,if that were true hed be winning
2007scape,not_removed,for things that affect the game jagex has made it clear that buying votes is not acceptable like the top comment said this has no effect on the game whatsoever
2007scape,not_removed,its a fucking plastic gnome nobody gives a shit
2007scape,not_removed,no it really doesnt
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt even vote because i dont care but good guess
2007scape,not_removed,i will trade my paper for the gnome
2007scape,not_removed,not really for example the time i voted a friend was winning as a youtuber and i can easily say some osrs players saw this and checked out his videos this will remain for a long time and more subscribersmore money
2007scape,not_removed,snow days were the best when you knew you could get on rs early brings back memories of a simpler game time
2007scape,not_removed,holidaze
2007scape,not_removed,its also because you need a new client for the download and i think a lot of people me included are reluctant to download it also you have to consider how much cheaper bonds are in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,with the value of gold on being cheaper than on oldschool bonds are actually cheaper on

2007scape,not_removed,imagine if they just de ironed iron willed because of this post
2007scape,not_removed,hey please check your rs message centre and reply to the message i have just sent mod luce o
2007scape,not_removed,id like to make sure my permanent is actually permanent x like it says no chance to change like if i get hacked i dont want the fucker to be able to change my status even though i clearly selected permanent
2007scape,not_removed,what is so confusing about permanent
2007scape,not_removed,as far as i know they send you a message to your characters message centre
2007scape,not_removed,thank you very much for the swift reply ive responded to the message
2007scape,not_removed,except its not
2007scape,not_removed,and why should we not rule out youve hacked iron willed and the owner is currently on a break quit and not knowing that theyve been hacked until they return to the game
2007scape,not_removed,i know they change it but that doesnt make my comment irrelevant
2007scape,not_removed,hey moosefrenzy each and every account that wishes to deiron is check thoroughly to make sure it is the owner that is contacting us mod luce o
2007scape,not_removed,yes it does invalidate your comment when i made my ironman i chose permanent because if it was hijacked it would be far harder for the hijacker to deiron me because i knew that the only way a permanent ironman could be deironed would be by contacting a jmod and waiting for them to verify that i am the original owner
2007scape,not_removed,good to know
2007scape,not_removed,slayer probably
2007scape,not_removed,slayer
2007scape,not_removed,definitely slayer
2007scape,not_removed,i believe construction is the rarest
2007scape,not_removed,in this order i suspect slayer construction runecrafting
2007scape,not_removed,untrimmed hp is not rare wtf are u guys smoking
2007scape,not_removed,hitpoints id say
2007scape,not_removed,slayer hp and runecrafting are all about equal edit because a lot of accounts stop training defatt and just train rangestr to a large majority of accounts get a combat before hp slayer isnt hard just takes time to set up right gotta cannon all tasks so you dont get too much hp xp but not too much to get range its just a chore thats why its rare runecrafting bc fuck runecrafting
2007scape,not_removed,probably not slayer actually since thats a fairly common goal and not too difficult these days wouldnt be surprised if runecrafting or construction are more rare
2007scape,not_removed,i got untrimmed hp by accident tbh didnt even know it was rare im sure its not as rare as a slayer untrimmed that requires some planning if i did it accidentally i wouldnt be the first or last to
2007scape,not_removed,its not rare or difficult
2007scape,not_removed,nah i had to purposely switch to strength only training to not get hp first as i wanted the untrimmed str cape
2007scape,not_removed,dam hp cape is rare
2007scape,not_removed,untrimmed yes untrimmed is your first
2007scape,not_removed,i have created quite a few accounts with untrim hp cape but i never worried about doing the drop trick to keep them p
2007scape,not_removed,ill look into it just need more cb levels lol
2007scape,not_removed,you dont need till you apply you can intro and come on the ts
2007scape,not_removed,and then you went to youtube and someone told you to kys its the internet live with it or without it ive played osrs for months now ive never had anything similar happen to me
2007scape,not_removed,this was a main reason people levelled alfs if they want to crash you and camp it just leave the account and play the other i know you shouldnt need too but like you have seen people are cunts dont bother looking for a new world just choose a world and log each day
2007scape,not_removed,theres always going to be horrible people to ruin something especially when its protected by a screen you should just have fun and learn how to avoid something like that private on friends and youre pretty much done sand crabs massive area and theres no reason you shouldve been spotted easy and theres not even a tiny bit of proof in the screenshot youve shown for all we know you couldve just right clicked a stranger to get him banned for being better off in the game than you which would make you horrible one in this situation also odd you put in youre not a person to complain but thats the entire point of the post and went as far to ask for banning easiest way to avoid ge is to play like an ironman and theres still plenty of people to talk to when skillin and killin
2007scape,not_removed,never had this happen to me my private chat is also on friends only maybe this explain how a random dude somehow followed you between worlds
2007scape,not_removed,easy fix turn off public and private chat
2007scape,not_removed,you shouldnt be on the internet if your feelings are hurt so bad
2007scape,not_removed,looks like thats the only option
2007scape,not_removed,had to go to the bank to make it seem like i was afk and wait for him to leave and if you look through any of my post you would see i am not one to complain for me to even post something like this it has to be a very persistent thing i get where youre coming from
2007scape,not_removed,that explains it
2007scape,not_removed,also trying to correlate the grand exchange with a reduction in player quality is ridiculous its obvious this post has nothing to do with the toxic community but rather your own shortcomings and its pretty convienient for you because if someone disagrees theyre toxic
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think you get the meaning of this post
2007scape,not_removed,where the fuck does it say my feelings are hurt 😂 you automatically assume that everyone who has something to say has their feelings hurt
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i was just saying theres a lot of potential that you might be the bad guy in this situation too as didnt take an important screenshot to show something but instead just right clicked them
2007scape,not_removed,so youve played years of runescape and however many of old school and you havent toggled that to a better option
2007scape,not_removed,when i made a reference to that i wanted to correlate to the time period where the ge was not around
2007scape,not_removed,yup ugh
2007scape,not_removed,melee was the way before recently bandos magic lvl has been lowered significantly making trident max mage gear really really good you freeze graardor and just use trident on him freeze him again and repeat
2007scape,not_removed,this was patched
2007scape,not_removed,oh
2007scape,not_removed,ah the zoro dragon
2007scape,not_removed,mugiwaraaa
2007scape,not_removed,hehehehehe xd
2007scape,not_removed,na they stopped doing that around cataclysm bro
2007scape,not_removed,half of you sit in stream and call him a ginger cunt context and relationships with people do it cause thats how they bond ginger followers are weird with random people theyre being rude think about how act with your friends compared to with a stranger on the street
2007scape,not_removed,its because theyre almost all dicks and many of them rwt so they can just get to pking and staking did i mention nearly all of them are dicks
2007scape,not_removed,i think the community should try to come together and help push the game forward instead of hurting each other i agree but you have those in both communities that dont want this ive objectively seen more disrespect from the pking community so maybe targeting the skilling and pvm community in your argument isnt the correct approach
2007scape,not_removed,i agree pking is a part of the game that makes it refreshing and fun it is also a much needed gold sink
2007scape,not_removed,but whats really toxic and hurtful to me is that a lot of good pvp content doesnt pass the polls for no other reason than people dont like pkers source
2007scape,not_removed,pking is the funnest idc if funnest isnt a real word thing ive done in this game i only item in mems though too many clanstry hards
2007scape,not_removed,i dislike the pking community because of the people who kill people for fun yes i understand im in the wilderness to do a clue or run to the abyss but do you really need to kill me for bones let the rage begin
2007scape,not_removed,virgins suck at pking so hate it
2007scape,not_removed,its just banter its the same kind of way a bunch of guys would act when playing a sport only its a bit enchanted because its the internet
2007scape,not_removed,all of the rs communities rwt to be fair but there not all dicks its mostly just internet banter and a competitive drive also if you have a problem with pkers you could gear up and go get some pvmer vengeance😜
2007scape,not_removed,maybe you see more disrespect from the pking community because they feel like outcasts in the game and the other communities dont care about them but go to a slayer spot and watch someone get crashes if you want to see the toxic side of the pvm community
2007scape,not_removed,bossing and skilling in the wilderness is really fun too its also had a lot good goldresource sinks
2007scape,not_removed,idk why you would need a source almost every pvp poll fails except for cash sinks
2007scape,not_removed,yeah id love to see changes that need clans and help solosmall teams pk so that everyone can enjoy the wilderness but still leave areas where try hards can pk
2007scape,not_removed,pking is like pvming graardor isnt guaranteed to drop tassets every kill actually majority of the time he drops absolute junk similarly naked people in the wilderness drop nothing most of the time however there are times they dont bank their runes while rcing or forgot to bank their cash stack while doing a clue etc and since killing a naked person takes effort and supplies there is no reason not to kill them tip make yourself not worth attacking ive done tons of clues in the wilderness and have walked past pkers regularly and so far i havent been attacked one time
2007scape,not_removed,i mean if clues had no risk that means they would be easier and more people couldwould do them and that would lower he value of clue items and make them not as special also the void abyss is insanely profitable and beat the hell out of doing rune runs the normal way so dont you think that justifies them to have a little a risk
2007scape,not_removed,well if youre playing halo youre killing people for fun so i dont see what the difference is
2007scape,not_removed,i think it just has a hard learning curve so people dont give it a chance but i think people would have a lot of bossingskilling no the wilderness if they gave it a chance and there where some updates to help pvmers and skillers from giant clans
2007scape,not_removed,theres a very key element missing in this banter if youre being a dick i cant punch you in the face the threat of being punched in the face is an often overlooked essential component of human interaction ps its not banter
2007scape,not_removed,go to anywhere two players can interact and youll have a chance of finding toxicity doesnt mean you will what im trying to say is that behaviour isnt confined to a playstyle its pretty much chanced with any interaction also bad mentality feeds bad mentality the pvp vs pvm bullshit has grown from tit to tat squabbles between the communities and really isnt as bad as people make it out to be
2007scape,not_removed,that doesnt do anything to back up his claim that they are failing because of some conspiracy against pvpers the majority of players dont pk should they not be allowed to vote
2007scape,not_removed,i get attacked of the time risking literally bones ive had teams waste runes to freeze me then switch to melee and waste an ags spec on me i respect max pkers way more then pures because not all of them pures pk to get their little epeens up im less salty when i get killed at scorpia risking then i am when i get ags speced for bones trying to get a clue
2007scape,not_removed,what a horrible comparison
2007scape,not_removed,hard learning curve not very wellcoming community in general some pkers like yourself seem to be wellcoming
2007scape,not_removed,great points
2007scape,not_removed,you can always banter back and if that doesnt work you can always give them an ags to the face😉
2007scape,not_removed,if pvmers are preventing updates for the pking community because they have a larger player basemore people willing to vote than yeah its kind of a problem
2007scape,not_removed,a lot of people openly admit they dont vote for pvp updates because it doesnt effect them and they want the mods to create content theyll do which is a selfish reason also the majority of people dont pk but that doesnt mean they should just vote no updates for something that would benefit the game
2007scape,not_removed,i think its just runescape in general at this point sadly people just expect everyone to know everything about the game you know the no xp waste mentality but some pkers have the no kill waste mentality so there just stuck up there own asses and shun anyway that hasnt pked since
2007scape,not_removed,thanks pony feel free to jump in the conversation 🙂
2007scape,not_removed,yeah youre missing the point people hate the scenario where a clan of pkers kills them doing a clue and then shit talks them when they die also an ags to the face thats not a threat that will curb anyones behavior
2007scape,not_removed,i do agree with that but i also believe some of it is from blanket no voters and those who dont actually understand the question and its effects good posts explaining why these updates are integral to the pvp community may help sway some of the no voting
2007scape,not_removed,only takes to make something fail a poll pkers can make polls fail for skilling and pvm too easily and they do
2007scape,not_removed,the minmaxing mentality is my least favorite thing in the game i liked using a rune dagger to train early on because it was funny to stab giants with a toothpick for an extra half an hour
2007scape,not_removed,i think big pvp clans are cancer for the most part and they ruin the wilderness more than anything else but im talking if a singlesmall team does a little trash talk they just want you to do it back and fight back it makes it more competitive and interesting
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i feel like they could do a better job of explaining some of pvp updates or someone in the community should try to do it but i mean look at this thread it has comments and zero up votes because theres a decent sized anti pk circle jerk community that trys to destroy anything pvp related
2007scape,not_removed,like what
2007scape,not_removed,haha yeah i remember being so proud of my d long and using it all the time
2007scape,not_removed,its the solo pkers as well many of them also skit talk i dont have numbers but i would actually bet that there are more shit talkers among those who pk skillerspvmers than those who pvp so you might be missing them
2007scape,not_removed,phrasing
2007scape,not_removed,yeah id agree with you that a lot of pkers enjoy to shit talk but i mean its just like multiplayer on like call of duty or halo its nothing serious just some people looking to troll each other
2007scape,not_removed,😮
2007scape,not_removed,see theres trolling and then theres trolling you have bad trolling like taking all the cw barricades from your team and hiding them on the map so your team has no barricades and then theres good trolling like collapsing the cw mines on much higher levels insulting someone after you either fought them or hunted them is bad trolling its a bit of a respect to your opponent type deal also note after bantering with someone in a football match you go out and have a beer with them cant do that here
2007scape,not_removed,i agree theres different forms of trolling and some people do take it too far but thats not the entire community kind of like the pvm community isnt just filled with people that would crash an ironman soloing bandos also if you pk a decent amount at certain spots youll start to see the same people and you can make friends with them and pk with them so thats kind of like going out a grabbing a beer
2007scape,not_removed,yes but im still drinking alone in my room which makes me an alcoholic crashing and flaming is somewhat comparable to toxic pking you have a stranger on the street calling you a cunt in both cases while he steals your shoelaces
2007scape,not_removed,its cancer but have you tried pest control intermediate boat
2007scape,not_removed,mole is pretty much for pet chill bossing for decent profit or farming and herblore supplies for ironmen
2007scape,not_removed,mole is with fally shield u pleb
2007scape,not_removed,to be fair doing mole with fally hard diary isnt that bad gphr if you have decent stats also people dont really do mole for money just for pet andor slayer task what you dont get very often youve seen guides so you know the mole digs randomely so yeh try something else for moneymaking
2007scape,not_removed,the easy answer and what you shouldve looked into before trying it is doing the falador hard diary gives you a mole locater as well with noted claws and skin its not worth doing without the diary
2007scape,not_removed,not at all its hour with full dharok fally hard diary done
2007scape,not_removed,nah mole is chill as fk semi afk when you have the fally shield and maxed cb chance for it to dig every hit under hp so yeah quit your bitching its one of the oldest bosses in this game the mechanics wont change just because you are too short sighted to get the falador hard diaries done
2007scape,not_removed,if emily could fake a giant mole id be impressed
2007scape,not_removed,i guess she could draw mole whiskers on
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,ge massacre wut
2007scape,not_removed,idk which is worse solo player hiding or clanmanmode
2007scape,not_removed,whats wrong with inv winning how ur supposed to win
2007scape,not_removed,pretty much
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck i love your name
2007scape,not_removed,i think hes referring to kids who snipe inside the varrock bank and then box an alt to avoid dying
2007scape,not_removed,tbh if you make a pvp gamemmode and use gas to block of areas to force everyone into multi its kinda obvious that jagex wants clans to win thats fine and all but if someone can hide in the final combatzone without beeing seen by others and they cant go to look for him because taking step too much in the wring way instantly kills you that is really bullshit
2007scape,not_removed,shh dont tell them the secret
2007scape,not_removed,alright alright alriiiiiight
2007scape,not_removed,beggars cant be choosers bitch this aint chipotle
2007scape,not_removed,its almost like texting a girl
2007scape,not_removed,canel
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,exactly what i was going to post but you missed one
2007scape,not_removed,you a wavy dude
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,he was memeing are you new
2007scape,not_removed,hate how people actually give him or a d scim and hell continue to keep begging
2007scape,not_removed,umm they are already implementing the area that hasnt been added in already from gentletractors design they arent going to redo the continent as umodmatk had already explained its uselessness to do so
2007scape,not_removed,oh really uselessness man thats wrong no actual runescape update has ever excited me as much as gentletractors design for zeah
2007scape,not_removed,dont get me wrong i love the proposed the design too i cant find the original post but to put it simply the amount of work thats needed to be put into redesigning the continent will offer little to no reward as the lack of content in zeah will still remain and to get it done in a feasible time would mean that no big content updates will happen aswell it wont bring in a wave of new players like deadman would bring in

2007scape,not_removed,i can see where youre coming from in a sense but the redesign would increase the quality tenfold of what will eventually be a large part of the game quality over quantity every single time in my book
2007scape,not_removed,which is why the rest of the continent would look similar to what was proposed
2007scape,not_removed,the wintertodt rewards in general have been nerfed its not that much gphr even with relatively good stats telegrabbing is usually mostly open on members worlds i havent checked the total world that might be open an hour is on the high side for if you cant flip so if youre right with that its good if you get magic to telegrab things try telegrabbing nature runes in high level wilderness by where callisto is in members
2007scape,not_removed,first off get members kill chaos druids to herblore then make unfinished potions for decent money per hour to sustain a bond then look into other less soulcrushing methods like mort myre fungus or combat like green drags and eventually bossing also wines are not crowded in members but arent great money
2007scape,not_removed,if youre trying to save up for a bond honestly id try to get your stats up for moneymaking in members then buy your first bond with irl money the grind is nasty
2007scape,not_removed,how much is great money now days for low levels that is i just really need a foundation as my bank is literally with the spawn time of wines you can get around an hour with fally teleport which is an hour ive heard a looting bag can increase this as well
2007scape,not_removed,yeah im finding the grind in horrible but i really want to at least make a foundation in my bank is less than at the moment
2007scape,not_removed,if you have startup money to buy things from shops theres a couple around an hour no requirements thatd be the benchmark i shoot for
2007scape,not_removed,i would look into having stats for blast furnace its simple not afk steady money when you have members till then money i think you are on the right track with cooking stuff like pizza and potatoes though i dont know the best one youd have to find out yourself
2007scape,not_removed,if you get the required smithing level i think i dont remember off the top of my head for making cannonballs you can afk those super easily once youre members for about only looking at your screen every it took me a month and a half to build up my bank in to about i wasnt trying too hard though and i borrowed the from my brother to get into members from there i havent been since so it definitely gets a lot easier in members honestly going to drop parties in world ge is one of the better moneymaking methods in
2007scape,not_removed,ive got around now would that be sufficient if so what are some of the things i can buy from shops
2007scape,not_removed,this is where a little research on your part plays in as prices are variable and ive moved on from most shop money making methods off the top of my head buying dragon hides off the ge and tanning them death runes from the zammy mage north of edge runes in general can be good mage training arena can be upwards of an hour depending on how focused you are construction shop in keldagrim probably good right now a construction qol update just came out pest control rune shop also has chaos runes you can make soft clay depending on how the prices are that can be an hour buy karambwans from the tai bwo wanna shop make unfinished potions for herblore charge skills necklaces combat bracelets and amulets of glory cleaning some herbs you really just gotta look at the prices and see which method is currently the most profitable usually the one the youtubers have been making the least videos about recently getting smithing up for blast furnace is another profitable option
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the great tips ill probably try doing some herbpot related ones since id like to raise my herblore ive heard ranarr runs can give some pretty great steady profits
2007scape,not_removed,totally forgot about farming yep farm runs can be some great money and you get one of the best ones ranarr at a low level
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think it will drop as much as you are thinking i feel magic gear was lacking alot and this fills that void the new items will be quite rare and very high priced i suspect especially since it wont deteriorate new item wont be affordable to many players who will probably still choose to use ahrims
2007scape,not_removed,worth mentioning if you guys hate the idea of the new spell the changes could also be applied but instead to benefit shadow spells more shadow barrage has a max of somewhere around with a casting cost of which is insane ahrims current effect with the ammy of the damned is to autocast ancients so if the buffs where targeted at shadow spells as well itd work just as nicely
2007scape,not_removed,i like this suggestion help keep ahrims set alive again
2007scape,not_removed,while that may be true ahrims is in need of a buff regardless the hood and staff are worthless
2007scape,not_removed,reach out to mods on twitter
2007scape,not_removed,meh you still botted so fuck off
2007scape,not_removed,this is what ive been trying to convey all day spears were broken flat out broken so much so we went to mmks stream and overspeared him for minutes although its clunky and crappy right now try and use it youll see the spear nerf was for the right reason however this really opened up the floodgates for iteming we wont gear up if we know well get itemed its not anger its not tears its basic economics buffing smite would hurt edge deep single pking so itd be hypocritical of us to ask for a fix in multi that hurts the other aspects of pvp a specific item added or buffed specific for hurting low def opponents would be good ancient mace currently fits the role but the name is probably scary enough to never pass a poll im not gonna bother suggesting because i dont want to detract from the point of this topic when it comes to overspearing we were all on the same page we all thought it was far too strong we asked the mods to fix it too in regards to iteming we are once again on the same page iteming breeds more iteming because nobody wants to be the guy that loses gear to a group of gsballista while his friends are forced to run or die with him eventually its lame and hurts small teamsclans especially
2007scape,not_removed,good post hopefully more people understand the situation were dealing with
2007scape,not_removed,for example i was doing callisto the other day and this kid with zgs just kept coming back and back through annakarl teleport to spec me out and try to kill me good job jagex for not properly doin a job
2007scape,not_removed,i cant think of another runescape example so heres a league of legends example lol in competitivelcs league teams are always using the champions that are currently op if they didnt they would simply lose because every other team is using the op champions you cant be mad at teams for doing it because they have to or they will be unable to compete or do the balancing style and buff the counterplay how about smite removing of damage dealt from opponents prayer or a special attackspell that disables protect item prayer could even add that to the arceuus spellbook to make the spellbook viable in wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,not sure why people are under the impression clans were anti spear nerf they just didnt want spears nerfed without any method to combat iteming
2007scape,not_removed,youre so clueless you cant spear and mace an entire team specially if they have barragechins i get the rest of what youre saying and i somewhat agree the spear nerf was needed but they overnerfed it
2007scape,not_removed,the problem being that these changes will not only effect pk clans i cant see a buff to smite happening as it would affect edge pking where iteming is not a problem as to buffing either the mace or the spear there is no way any improved method to smite will pass a poll there are simply too many pvmers that firstly do not want to be able to be smited easier than they already can be and secondly do not care about the very few people in pvp clans that want to multi pk and are affected by itemers the solution isnt to make a replacement for the broken spear
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for finally making the large necessary post about this the only thing that i have thought of and have mentioned on other threads is to make it so to skull you have to risk say at level to ge value aside from your to skull hopefully jagex doesnt wait too long with updating this because the current state of multi pking is awful edit the risk to skull is scaled with combat level
2007scape,not_removed,the main reason for me is it is part of the game and should stay that way it always has been and hopefully always will be it is way too late to remove something like that from the game regardless of if you agree with that the reason you just outlined is enough for it to be a completely unacceptable idea people like to pk in wilderness with an ags so that idea also cannot happen
2007scape,not_removed,maybe make it so that your character has a variable lets call it x thats normally at dieing while skulled in level wildy increases the value of that number by if you go minutes without skulling the number will reset to if you skull while the number is or greater you will get a red skull instead the red skull will make item protection have a chance of failing equal to x so if x is at you have a chance of item protection failing if x is at theres a chance of it failing this makes it so that people who die while skulled in deep wildy will be discouraged from repeatedly coming back with a as they continually increase their chance of losing the the red skull wont appear until x is at or higher so you can come back twice after dieing without the penalty legitimate players who die might want to regear and come back but also bring a but if youre repeatedly come back and dieing very quickly youre going to very quickly get the red skull penalty the numbers and mechanics can be adjusted for balance just throwing out the basic idea
2007scape,not_removed,id rather people feel safe bringing an ags deep wild to get smited and actually have a change of losing besides bringing a dds with no chance at smite
2007scape,not_removed,the dev team only touches pvp content after rot abuse it hopefully it doesnt take another years to nerf iteming
2007scape,not_removed,even without spear nerf clans could item wars theyd lose what zgs per war thats really not much to most people theyre just deciding to be crybabies about it
2007scape,not_removed,revert it
2007scape,not_removed,ok so you are team a looking to fight with a clan of team b that agrees to your rules if team b is not risking anything then just leave
2007scape,not_removed,honestly i dont care if there are itemers running around that has been around all the time in preeoc if high level clans use let them it just harms their reputation for being a shitstain clan frightened to risk also how are they immortal i mean they only have one item they will just get barraged and thats it furthermore if they do bring supplies isnt that better those supplies cost them up to their teeth pray pots are sharks are etc they cant keep coming back time after time unless they literally item and just bring their weapon which again is very ineffective
2007scape,not_removed,also to be honest itemers will probably hurt pvmers more than d spears if itemers can attack pvmers without any risk to themselves it is going to happen a lot more often we already see that d spears werent even that bad for pvmers because they are not skulled are you kidding me sure they can attack pvmers but it is extremely unlikely they would ever kill someone most pvmers arent in multi so that is zero of an issue and if the pvmer steps into multi sure they will die if there are like people there but they would also die and on top of that loose their vs spearers all you people in support of spears saying they held back the flood gates of this shit only affects pkers not pvmers in fact the dspear has helped pvmers tremendously looks like ill be keeping my cya also there is zero correlation between spears and pking this is all just a retarded attempt at making them seem necessary when its a lie everything is an issue when you bring groups of people into the equation no matter what gear you are using you will someone if you dbow spec dude with people the difference is now that you cant abuse spears it wont stun them for minutes smite them so you can take their no more ely pking for you
2007scape,not_removed,why are so many people complaining about iteming never been to world ports
2007scape,not_removed,sohow about this what if they made it to where if youre risking under minus your plus one you cant use protect item or something along those lines maybe not as idk what accounts that would screw but theres gotta be some balance to this one iteming frenzy maybe it would just lead to kids bringing ags plus as its a small amount but it would at least make them risk something tldr if you risk under you cant protect item
2007scape,not_removed,ancient mace is in the game for a reason one iteming still imposes a guaranteed risk of being smited
2007scape,not_removed,its the wilderness no one is making you go out there and risk your gps
2007scape,not_removed,i always saw iteming as an issue with single pking i cant recall people actually iteming in multi unless clans were already fighting and they just wanted to crash or it was jaja in gear and then after mins they just rag but that wont change with this update either dont play rs anymore but i dont think this will change much for anyone as much as some make it seem has been around since forever and clans have always dealt with it in fights without resorting to spears and i doubt anyone is gono follow rot around on their pks dying to them over and over trying to item
2007scape,not_removed,i dont see the problem one iteming will always exist regardless of what you do with d spear why do people rot members bitch about that they have to fight people who dont risk anything when they themselves have to risk their gear i mean if you dont want to risk your stuff then dont fight against one itemers
2007scape,not_removed,is one iteming really a problem though itemers are like squashing bugs compared to d spear also tbh the vast majority of itemers are probably the triggered clan pkers that are trying to revert the nerf and theyll more than likely give up soon
2007scape,not_removed,what about removing the item pray
2007scape,not_removed,they should remove the ability to use the protect item prayer while skulled
2007scape,not_removed,okay so i do not fucking get the problem yes iteming sucks yeah people want it removed but people have been iteming for literally years spears regardless if what u say were used in a way that they were never intended to be used and quite frankly jagex is at fault because as soon as they saw u could do this they should have stopped it i hate that no one has said this yet but removing item would most likely destroy the only real pking left ur clan pking i couldnt give a fuck about u try to make it out like ur team is good at pking ur not when its its no longer pking its player hunting for money which by all means u should be able to do just dont say it will ruin pking because u guys arnt pkers plain and simple if u get caught out in multi and die for ur bank to a team of itemers and ur not in a clan no one cares but as soon as the big dogs come out people agree and are sympathetic towards these people like tf are u a child with no since of self heres the deal mainly to rot as that is the most that ive seen here u guys are one of the best fucking player killing clans out there why the fuck is this such an issue u had no problem preying on the week before and now that your the weak ones that cannot adapt ur blow the unfair whistle dont ruin it for everyone the second u pass something to combat these itemers u will kill off what is left of the pking community dont believe me just go head and fuck it up for yourselves and dont look to the rest of the community for help once u do some ideas so u dont think im so one sided make it so players who die x times in a row without killing a player cannot enter wilderness for x period of time players who die with only item a certain of time are set on a cooldown to where they can only att their target until they kill them or something anyways the only way i can see this iteming thing be a problem is if u go into multi wildy and get jumped by a clan first off if ur a clan of pkers its ur fault same excuses u guys used so dont bitch u should know u intend to do the same but to players by themselves so inturn this will affect only players by themselves and again you would say you should have avoided multi dont be a fucking hypocrit about this shit dont fall for this shit it happens all the time eventually the big pking clans will figure it out or die out its how the world works hate me plz but only if u can prove to me with facts that im wrong because this change has only been here for a minimal amount of time so any inferred changes would be based purely on speculation and not on facts which if u cant figure out why thats bad dont fucking suggest anything
2007scape,not_removed,was also trying to convey this constantly people kept saying theres a counter play to iteming just barrage them and run or you have better gear than them so you should win unless youre shit etc etc and then theyd finish it by saying youre an idiot if you thought spears were okay id much rather have itemers than d spears completely missing the point for the most part people arent asking for the spear to be reverted theyre saying that since its been reverted iteming is a huge problem thats not the same as asking for d spear to be reverted for fuck sake and of course just barrage and run and you have better gear than them is one of the stupidest arguments for anything ive heard on this sub you can tell these people are clueless about pvp especially in regards to the meta of multi pking its like they think that once you die you cant return so once you finish killing the itemers since youre better geared than them you win and they wont come back i dont understand how these people who are so clueless about the topic are as passionate about it as if they pk you can tell they dont pvp but their arguments scream the only time im in the wilderness is when im doing a clue its people like these and jagex historically taking years to fix anything related to pvp which will probably guarantee iteming is going to be a problem for a very long time
2007scape,not_removed,if you bring out content or buff existing that counters low def youre going to hurt pures more than iteming mains so thats just not going to work
2007scape,not_removed,deep wild needs a sort of checks and balance to keep it honest and as fucked up as it sounds abusing spears was the only thing doing that like you said respectable clans arent going to gear up if they know they are going to get itemed and with a hugely lowered wilderness activity level it hurts the runescape economy as a whole
2007scape,not_removed,i have some questions if you hypothetically were to try to dspear someone back in would it have worked the same way did spearing exist back then what did clans do before they figured out the dspear
2007scape,not_removed,hard to get to the reddit kids when the only encounter they have with the wild is doing a hard clue scroll in people who support this change just dont know the impact it has on deep wild multi zones
2007scape,not_removed,not enough memes and rot hate feel free to downvote n flame my clan below heres a video of us taking some elysagses to solidify our salt
2007scape,not_removed,the thing is this is the clan world and word about fights get around fast if team a and b are in a fight then there could be a team c sat lvls of wild south with people and spears and maces waiting for people who are trying to return to the fight or people who ran out of food if you hear word of a mace and spear squad sniping your members you will put away your godswordssotd etc reallllll fast
2007scape,not_removed,the mace is horribly innacurate pvmers arent in danger unless they cant click a prayer potion which in all honesty you kinda deserve to get smited out in the wilderness if thats the case increasing the strength bonus of the mace or smite power would be fair youre right it wouldnt pass a poll but neither did d spear fortunately for those pvmers the new update made it so you keep your most expensive items even if you get smited out so i doubt a team will dump specs in max accuracy on the off chance of getting your v flail when they can more quicklysafely kill you in basic mystic ags
2007scape,not_removed,im going to be adding on to the post in a sec about pvm it does hurt pvmers they are going to be attacked and pked a lot more if people dont need to risk anything to do it it makes ragging risk free also even without a lot of strength bonus a itemer with agsballista will eventually get a lucky hit and kill them
2007scape,not_removed,rather have it scaled to combat skill total level or total exp for fairness to pures
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think i understood that correctly youre saying iteming should stay because its part of the game
2007scape,not_removed,this kind of mechanic wouldnt help it would just make even people in gear who are dying a lot during a clan fight have to return with sub par equipment d scim instead of a tent whip ect
2007scape,not_removed,and do what exactly stop pking because a clan is out there iteming that is the dumbest solution ive seen today and i see it everywhere
2007scape,not_removed,all you need is sharks a dose ppot blitz casts thats really nothing to someone who brings an ags to wildy lmao and theyre immortal essentially because they can come back again and again with the same minimal to no risk
2007scape,not_removed,yes theres a reason you avoided them was it in i feel like it was more when it became a massive shitfest now put that all over the wilderness with instant gdz teles stamina pots more communication to cover ground and item properly its actual aids lets not base our wild on ports outside of cwabh of the old days lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,i dont like the idea of someone being unable to protect item if they skull in the wilderness because maybe they had no idea they werent going to be able to believe it or not i dont want to get someones ags in this sort of situation lol years ago with reach i was suggesting a value of post skull risk protect item for certain combat levels before you can attack people first this means you can only retaliate if youre not risking think of it like dmm skulling if youre iteming youre only allowed to hit people thatve engaged you he sounded keen on it a while back too i dont remember what the reasoning was behind me and him being convinced in the end it wasnt a good idea but hopefully i can remember it i thought it was the fact clue scrollers would get feasted on that he mentioned but i think dmm actually set the precedent for being able to retaliate if you got hit at no skull consequence idk this may be something i should send to another mod now that i think of it lol
2007scape,not_removed,familiar with jaja but not familiar with the immaturity of the pk scene alll our rival clans and antirot will item us we wont let them do it and get loot
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont like people sabotaging at blast furnace just dont do blast furnace if you dont like people sabotaging at castle wars just dont play castle wars you see how that isnt a solution
2007scape,not_removed,that would kill far too much activity pvmers will permanently lose their v flails and all big ticket items will be out of reach for pkers theres worlds for that and the lack of activity in them is pretty telling
2007scape,not_removed,and what do the thousands of accounts built around this very mechanic do almost every pure in the game will get shafted
2007scape,not_removed,the problem isnt that clans will die or struggle to adapt the problem is that all the clans will go from risking a few hundred k to risking nothing the clans will adapt fine its just worse gameplay currently than if iteming was somehow stoppednerfed stopping players from entering wild for a while if they dont risk might work
2007scape,not_removed,oh fuck i think we just found out how to make it pass a poll its anti pure
2007scape,not_removed,nah giving mace higher accuarcy doesnt hurt pures at all because its already hit times
2007scape,not_removed,i dont quite remember exactly but i remember preeoc you needed to spear properly and couldnt just full retard dump them in order to get a successful string of spears it was pretty amazing watching cwa clans time spears but now thats all gone not that stacking them full retard was any better
2007scape,not_removed,dont get me wrong i am fully for a solution to one iteming but i and i imagine most other players will not accept anything that will increase our chance of being smited it just wont happen we can now take items we want to protect into the wilderness and keep them when we die if we die to a itemer so be it we have kept the items we wanted to keep the rest we didnt care about anyway there is going to have to be an alternative way to prevent iteming than to make it easier for someone to smite them because no one is going to vote for it if it ends up on a poll
2007scape,not_removed,sorry i just downloaded reddit on to my phone i thought i was replying to a comment mb this was in regards to protect an item pray
2007scape,not_removed,if theyve already died times theyve practically lost a tentacle whip worth of mystic armourbarrow glovesgloryrunessupplies etc a chance of losing their tentacle isnt going to scare them from using their tentacle might scare them from using a godsword or ballista though
2007scape,not_removed,implying pking was every profitable cx
2007scape,not_removed,avoided them nah dude i was one of them which is why im advocating for the theres nothing wrong with iteming side
2007scape,not_removed,this is the kind of suggestion that has a chance to pass a poll it negatively affects no one except itemers from what i can see would feel very artificial but i would definitely take it i dont know how they would work around someone skulling and then leaving the wilderness and returning with item and still being skulled but a solution to that cant be too hard to come up with
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure what you are trying to say alll our rival clans and antirot will item us we wont let them do it and get loot thats is basically what i said lol
2007scape,not_removed,you see how a broken mechanic doesnt help anything you had oneitemers before d spear and you still have them the only way to get rid of oneitemers is to make wildy a place where you lose all of your items
2007scape,not_removed,i think it would only change the meta i mean most geared players are already risking so instead of the ags being the go to spec weapon people would instead bring the dds or the gmaul i think the only reason there is so little activity on the high risk worlds is because if you are hoping around looking for people and you brought your sotd or ags you dont want to risk it i really think that removing the item pray would fix this whole situation but youll always have a meta for pking but this way you dont have ags squads nor dspearing squads winwin
2007scape,not_removed,then dont risk what you cant keep lol
2007scape,not_removed,nothing to do with the game being a problem its the playerbase
2007scape,not_removed,oh so its not ok when it effects you and your clan but another large portion of the player base is perfectly fine
2007scape,not_removed,why hurt pures though try to think of a solution that isnt going to hurt a part of the playerbase instead of being so smug rot is cancer c x in the chat boys
2007scape,not_removed,in pre eoc it was even easier you could hit them eith carrots which never dealt damage and bolas them so you did damage meanwhile you have abby titans which ony deal hp damar when the opponent has prayer points so it was guaranteed smite the only things that didnt make this as mainstream is that there was no pvm that required items so no casuals were complaining in large amounts and also most people didnt item with claws or ags as chaotic maul and polypore was far better
2007scape,not_removed,if you as a pvmer are getting speared and smited out ill assume you are also wearing veracs because thats what a majority of wilderness bosses require based on the spear changes that proposed then you are doing something horribly horribly wrong or stupid even in the old system i did callisto kills in veracs and was attempted to be smited about times and wasnt smited once because i knew how to counter it
2007scape,not_removed,im aware youre advocating for it language isnt lost to me through the internet the way i used you wasnt meant to mean you in particular but rather everyone back then you knew not to go to ports back in the days if you pked
2007scape,not_removed,regardless of if youre skulled initiating an attack is what would apply in this case you can be skulled and not initiate but retaliate minutes after if you played dmm this would be like it
2007scape,not_removed,changing the meta isnt always good this absolutely shafts pvmers and im not bitter enough to say fuck em we need them in the wild for smaller teams they wont show up if theyll always lose their shit lol
2007scape,not_removed,you have to think realistically when coming up with solutions there are thousands of accounts based around the ability to protect an item and that is only one reason why this is a terrible idea
2007scape,not_removed,how is the player base at fault for adapting to the meta provided by the game currently its more effective to item with powerful because not only do you not risk you actually have great ko power for killing players in gear and pvmers
2007scape,not_removed,i think you missed the obvious sarcasm hes already stated hes against a fix that hurts other areas of pvp he was just making a joke about the fact that reddit hates pures just as much as they hate d spears
2007scape,not_removed,i was joking around
2007scape,not_removed,abby titans were also really fast at smiting vs someone in no armor they would hit anywhere from prayer points per hit per seconds and if you had alot you pretty mch got instant smted for example me and my friend drained this guy prayer pots from gdz to chaos dwarves with just ppl we fake teamed with him at revs then suggested to go ports but he was suspect we were somehow luring him we brought a bait acc to get him to skull on he even laughed at us when we bsed him those laughs quicky turned to fear
2007scape,not_removed,you are right that doesnt change the fact that it would make it easier for me to be smited it being only very slightly easier is irrelevant no one will vote for it that is the only point i am trying to make
2007scape,not_removed,ah i understand its the best suggestion so far hopefully the mods will discuss it
2007scape,not_removed,you are forgetting the fact that you already keep items so pvmers would only have to sacrifice item theyll still be there currently they bring dhidemonk robes a glory and a weapon and extra item and then a plus one would just force them to remove that plus one
2007scape,not_removed,i do understand that this would heavily affect edgeville pking and make accounts with att at a huge disadvantage to people with att which is the only reason i can think of where this solution has a negative impact on the game maby make it so that after you cant protect item pray i would love to hear your other reasons for this being a terrible idea because i dont see them
2007scape,not_removed,because people care about small amounts of gp too much its choosing greed over respect the same principle has occurred in every aspect of osrs pvp
2007scape,not_removed,so was i hence c x
2007scape,not_removed,no one will vote for it thats the ideal solution
2007scape,not_removed,no they wont theyre complaining about being smited out by d spears this is a smite out by default personally id love the idea but pvmers cant lose extra gear by default
2007scape,not_removed,nobody would buy big like ags sotd ballista if you couldnt pvp with them
2007scape,not_removed,would ever support this it would destroy the price of high lvl spec weapons since they would no longer be viable in deep wild due to price and this would also ruin wildy pvm atm you can bring full veracs climbing boots str ammy and a legends cape a change like this would make you always lose a veracs piece so no pvmers would ever like this change all people who do clues and bring the items and their clue to would also get fked by this change
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but this subreddit is unforgiving as fuck
2007scape,not_removed,ha you think there is a chance this change will be implemented without a poll
2007scape,not_removed,have you ever been speared because honestly the worst feeling about it is being unable to do anything you are sitting there helpless in a panic with your pants down while being laughed at by people and this would promote the idea of only taking items you are willing to risk to the wilderness and they wont be losing any extra gear they dont bring since they still keep their items
2007scape,not_removed,waaa we still want to smitee easy wtf u dont get rediiit s disabling prot item above wild is the perfect solution no more fabricated fear about in reality nobody actually gives a shit about them besides the who actually think multi clan pking is worth living for as pvmers would die in multi to a clan either way and no more need to artificially force smites on people when your own skills just dont cut close enough thats basically the reason youre multi clan members trying to force the buff of spears anyways youre incapable of smiting now because you dont have the skillset nor the coordination to do it legitimately so you just want to sit back spear a little and let the broken game mechanics do the work for you good luck with that
2007scape,not_removed,you could youd just be risking them yes their price would change but theyd still be value able for their power but definitely cheaper than they are now
2007scape,not_removed,i know man its osrs at least its not league theyre worse
2007scape,not_removed,ideally but we know that wont happen d spear was fixed after failing a poll because sometimes the devs need to realize that everybody is self interested like youre saying which leads to certain groups getting shafted it genuinely would barely touch a veracer and im sure theres different ways to go about it but i dont see it happening because despite the warnings apparently its more important people keep their when theyre iteming than the wilderness not be aids in the opinion of a certain person in power
2007scape,not_removed,have you ever been speared because honestly the worst feeling about it is being unable to do anything you are sitting there helpless in a panic with your pants down while being laughed at by people yes i have but i have absolutely no idea what that has to do with anything we spoke about good pant down getting speared by people analogy though that happens to be my fetish and this would promote the idea of only taking items you are willing to risk to the wilderness and they wont be losing any extra gear they dont bring since they still keep their items but i want pvmers to kill the monsters as efficiently as possible lol why add that hurdle for them
2007scape,not_removed,youre incapable of smiting now mfw
2007scape,not_removed,what you just said is like saying you could build demonic thrones to construction its unreasonable and would kill small team pking no small team would want to pk cause the strong weapons are what make it fun but no small team will risk so much knowing massive clans pk yes nothing is stopping people from bringing ags but people are not dumb enough to bring an ags if they cant it u less u are the largest clan in the game
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it wont happen the d spear shouldnt have been polled imo i still dont know how it was even allowed to be in the game in such a state a way to stop iteming that doesnt involve them being smited is the only way a solution will pass a poll it will almost certainly feel very artificial though i understand that it would hardly affect someone in high tier armour but maybe in times it would and id rather not vote for that a little selfish maybe we all are
2007scape,not_removed,item is only a hurdle for people when using veracs is the most efficient way and in which case some people would risk the flail for that efficiency isnt that big of a risk for people who are worried about efficient kill times also id recommend a film called imagine them naked great xxx humiliation material he starts crying at one point and his mom is there and its just wonderful i wont spoil it for you
2007scape,not_removed,what everyone around me was saying is that getting is impossible unless we revert the dspear also the dds is quite strong
2007scape,not_removed,ahh fuggg not my flail instead those people will all get itemed and waste more timemoney than if they just took their chances with getting maced out which btw will barely be used on you d spear was like barrier to entry led to a kill and smite whereas the mace setup would be such a waste to use on pvmers that would only lose at most an extra flail lol
2007scape,not_removed,aite then
2007scape,not_removed,are people going to vote for a higher chance for themselves to lose that flail i highly doubt it that is really as far as this discussion needs to go because any change will be polled
2007scape,not_removed,he literally records entire gameplay sessions and uploads them i dont know how anyone would watch his videos lol
2007scape,not_removed,yikes
2007scape,not_removed,pretty crazy that the guy has so many videos and such little viewcountsubs
2007scape,not_removed,im sure he could do good if he edited his videos he has good commentating also currently his channel looks like a twitch vod backup so that may be why his sub count is low
2007scape,not_removed,the reason he has such low views and stuff is because he literally uploads everything he does every other ironman series has less videos and video time but have much more content put into the video like little updates unlike actual recording of boring skilling etc
2007scape,not_removed,it seems that this is for himself and not for others he just makes them public for other to see if for some reason they want to
2007scape,not_removed,he even includes his bank pin how authentic
2007scape,not_removed,prob because he wants to show to jagex that he isnt botting
2007scape,not_removed,all he is doing is just uploading every single minute he plays runescape with runescape music in the background if you skip to like episode almost all of them have less then views lol
2007scape,not_removed,exactly what i thought
2007scape,not_removed,pretty impressive that hes stuck with it this long though
2007scape,not_removed,takes very little effort just record everything you do and upload it no editing or anything required
2007scape,not_removed,you dont need to oneup posts from the front page
2007scape,not_removed,would be fantastic side games to play but i guess were too ambitious
2007scape,not_removed,he said on runeserver that hes still working on it but its been like years so im not holding out much hope
2007scape,not_removed,the world is well made too bad everything else about it looks terrible lol

2007scape,not_removed,after years of silence their fb page said they are developing again but this was in february and no news ever since
2007scape,not_removed,at that point you could just make a fps from scratch
2007scape,not_removed,im like sure its just miscellania ripped right from the game
2007scape,not_removed,yea like using the sniper from call of duty fuck that model a shitty dds and give it the runescape spec and other og weapons

2007scape,not_removed,your prayer will be drained theres nothing you can do about that so kill the brothers that you have to pray on dharok ahrim karil first and if you want to you can drink a dose for the others especially guthan he can heal from hitting you id recommend to teleport out and restore stats after each run so duel ring clan wars and then a barrows tab back maybe bring more prayer pots just in case
2007scape,not_removed,damn man this is actually a great idea this is definitely gonna be helpful
2007scape,not_removed,id say ranged and bring you max bonus gear that your willing to risk sometimes there are pkers out there
2007scape,not_removed,if you have range without melee use range ruby bolts then emerald bolts when hes half health if you have range but not melee just use diamond bolts if you have melee use melee
2007scape,not_removed,with over kills i think range is the best set up if you dont want to risk void use god hides for prayer bonus rune cbow acb if youre fancy glory for neck works just fine and is the best bank option imo ring of yolo just in case you dc too cuz shit happens you dont even need to prot mage when u fight kbd dont listen to the hype jester boots have a small def again magic but wear snake skins for more range bonus gl on pet and vissy
2007scape,not_removed,rune c bow or toxic blowpipe
2007scape,not_removed,magic bonus magic defense and regular defense dont mitigate the magical attacks at all same with protection prayers
2007scape,not_removed,toxic pipe is so you would lose out on the anti dragon shield
2007scape,not_removed,extended anti fires are the key
2007scape,not_removed,thats right thanks
2007scape,not_removed,his magic damage his dragonfire damage

2007scape,not_removed,fuk u faggot stole my original post
2007scape,not_removed,there is so many places where people cant cannon that are open in every world i dont see how you can complain about this
2007scape,not_removed,wasnt aware that rock crabs could be assigned
2007scape,not_removed,why wouldnt i use a cannon i want to train slayer as fast as possible and get my task over with a cannon is the best way to do that try the new dungeon on zeah or the fremenik dungeon to avoid cannons depends on your task i guess but dont blame the players for using every tool at their disposal
2007scape,not_removed,go somewhere else you cant cannon they pay for membership too
2007scape,not_removed,you could buy a cannon
2007scape,not_removed,i just want to train slayer like everyone else then get a cannon lol
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,theyre paying for membership and for the cannonballs youre leeching bro
2007scape,not_removed,gosh your anger sure fuels my desire to continue slaying efficiently with cannon youre playing an mmo just get good

2007scape,not_removed,love that guys videos
2007scape,not_removed,real life ironman
2007scape,not_removed,someone remade this video of him building the house and all with runescape level ups for each thing he did
2007scape,not_removed,these are some of my favorite youtube videos he even responds to comments what a champ
2007scape,not_removed,his videos are so cool watched them all haha
2007scape,not_removed,that video is basically just that guy performing a portion of the future max cape emote
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,went on a marathon watching all of his videos for the second time yesterday literally half the time i kept thinking this guys fucking brilliant hes got everything
2007scape,not_removed,the atmosphere in that picture is so beautiful to think that this is how we once were gives me some kinda weird feeling of gratitude our ancestors were doing exactly what he was doing but they did it just to survive kinda weird to think about
2007scape,not_removed,yea but when i posted it like few months ago it got downvoted to hell neat
2007scape,not_removed,the fire is giving him the finger after maxing it out
2007scape,not_removed,remindme hour
2007scape,not_removed,literally watched video min before seeing post

2007scape,not_removed,lowlander irl
2007scape,not_removed,someone made a rs related comment somewhere better send it to the front page of reddit every time
2007scape,not_removed,makes me believe skills should grant toolless methods like barb fishing
2007scape,not_removed,its too late we hate you

2007scape,not_removed,punching rocks for ore with mining yelling at ore to smelt it with smithing staring down trees til they fall over at wc wwestyle wrestling slayer tasks at calling gems fat until they cut themselves at craft etc
2007scape,not_removed,damn
2007scape,not_removed,what a
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,actually i think this guy is probably maxed in everything
2007scape,not_removed,the calling gems fat until the cut themselves got you my upvote lol
2007scape,not_removed,basically what solomons offered
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,f
2007scape,not_removed,thank you
2007scape,not_removed,guys i think we finally found zezima so pro at runescape he started maxing irl
2007scape,not_removed,not max melee hes like in combat skills a bodybuilder body would be max melee
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,bodybuilder strength attack most of them dont know how to fight
2007scape,not_removed,bodybuilder probably wouldnt be max agility though
2007scape,not_removed,id say str powerlifter would be str
2007scape,not_removed,idk the max cape emote looks like its pounds a clean and jerk isnt that far fetched nfl athletes can easily do it good high school athletes can as well these dudes could probably have that agility cape as well
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but you gotta keep in mind you could be doing that emote wearing full bandos and carrying barrels of coal tar with cannonballs
2007scape,not_removed,if were talking bodybuilders max strength is more like toptier i cant seem to find my neck territory
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i wish they would have put like plates on the bar that would have been epic
2007scape,not_removed,well shit you could do that with strength
2007scape,not_removed,i was talking based off the emote since that would seem to be the pinnacle of success for the rs part but yeah there are some crazy athletes out there
2007scape,not_removed,i only realized as i did that quest that vannaka really should feature in more quests forget lucien zanik nieve vannakas the original badass npc of runescape
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,thats some spicy meme
2007scape,not_removed,i met with he triggered
2007scape,not_removed,dankness to it
2007scape,not_removed,you wore rune full helm how did you wore rune full helm in middle of sentence
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥ｉ ｄ ｅ ｃ ｌ ａ ｒ ｅ ｔ ｈ ｉ ｓ ｍ ｅ ｍ ｅ ｔ ｏ ｂ ｅ ｐ ｕ ｒ ｅ ｆ ｉ ｒ ｅ 🔥🔥🔥 非常にスパイシー
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,this sounds like something a year old would think up
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt the suggestion we need its what we deserve
2007scape,not_removed,captain planet pet confirmed
2007scape,not_removed,these are the suggestions we need
2007scape,not_removed,should probably note i enjoy pking more which is why i stay away from twitch most of the time i usually just see skilling or training which is understandable but im not a huge fan
2007scape,not_removed,got brews yea im chunk
2007scape,not_removed,fox
2007scape,not_removed,there are basically none for the tourny its disappointing but i mean what do you expect same shitty no life grind ever months
2007scape,not_removed,check out framed and torvesta constant content of pking plus they do a lot of dmm vids
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i watch them haha been watching chunk since the first dmm seasonal because he was one of the first series of watched
2007scape,not_removed,absolutely disgusting jagex weed this issue out already
2007scape,not_removed,poorly photoshopped yet very high yielding meme support
2007scape,not_removed,theyre hiding it in the corn get to the chopper
2007scape,not_removed,i believe this is the evidence jagex has been looking for
2007scape,not_removed,its insane last night i got emblems from patch best moneymaker ever
2007scape,not_removed,in all seriousness the front page post about farmers could simply be people money making and only account is in combat at that moment so its possible to be person we know from jmods response that previous claims werent rwting bot farming but still people are going to repost same conditions as if its direct evidence
2007scape,not_removed,i guess im not the only one that leaves my strawberries corn fully grown bc of ocd p
2007scape,not_removed,hmm with over lifetime farming exp i find it odd i have yet to grow this herb lvl req maybe
2007scape,not_removed,least funny low tier meme ive seen here in a while still upvoted ofc
2007scape,not_removed,north of ge north of mind altar and north of lumberyard are boosters daily they have been there for months
2007scape,not_removed,you better be using magic secataurs and supercompost
2007scape,not_removed,spicy meme indeed worth entering stock on it
2007scape,not_removed,obby pures trying to get str nothing special
2007scape,not_removed,with so many people complaining about this i should probably get a rune pouch right now im part of the problem but it feels so good
2007scape,not_removed,umodmatk
2007scape,not_removed,spicy meme
2007scape,not_removed,even better yield from the magic secateurs
2007scape,not_removed,source on jmod response
2007scape,not_removed,lvl greed requirement
2007scape,not_removed,especially if you spam click the first couple seconds
2007scape,not_removed,last qa had them say they checked out accounts and saw nothing going on
2007scape,not_removed,that doesnt give you more yield just faster picking
2007scape,not_removed,i see nothing i know nothing
2007scape,not_removed,when attack is a grind lol take me back to that universe pls
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,is nobody going to point out that he needs to get his str up anyways to use dh
2007scape,not_removed,ive been told not to dh until str ss is good
2007scape,not_removed,ive been told not to dh until str no simply no i used dharoks from mid to and on hard mode rumble with the best nmz bosses it is always superior
2007scape,not_removed,str i get around str exph with overloads dharoking i get atk exph using whip d def and procy with just keeping piety on
2007scape,not_removed,hope much xp did you get i used abyssal daggerdd anyway
2007scape,not_removed,youd be getting with dharoks piety and overloads
2007scape,not_removed,an hour with dharoks overloads hp on extra exp nmz bosses
2007scape,not_removed,i use overloads already cant remember if i used granite maul for power surge when i made my dharoks run not enough prayer boost in dharoks to be lazy and leave piety on so i just use procy with overloads at
2007scape,not_removed,yup always been
2007scape,not_removed,if u max melee in nmz youll have more points than u could ever spend on herb boxs anyways lol
2007scape,not_removed,thanks guess ill stick to only taking the power surge powerups
2007scape,not_removed,i mainly just do my troll and black demon slayer tasks there these days so i go for finishing the task and ill stay after max points if i still need kills and have the supplies even ultimate force ones are nice because you get full slayer xp for the kill as long as youve damaged at all but im ironman so i really got more points than i can use
2007scape,not_removed,its a cool pet idea but i dont think a lot of players want to see pets for buyable skills at least there are a lot of people in this subreddit who have made it clear they dont want pets for buyables
2007scape,not_removed,no no buyable pets fletchingsmithingherbelorecooking should never have pets
2007scape,not_removed,no stop posting dumb pet ideas every day not everything needs a pet this isnt
2007scape,not_removed,investing in raw shrimps right now
2007scape,not_removed,disney lawyers use sue jagex to bankruptcy
2007scape,not_removed,tbh i was hopping it was the troll cook
2007scape,not_removed,rolling egg pet
2007scape,not_removed,they should make it the chaos elemental
2007scape,not_removed,it should be a crock pot with legs
2007scape,not_removed,should make the pet be one of the women that are found in lumbridge
2007scape,not_removed,where do you think resources come from is just bought at ge and sold after they made an specific item with loss
2007scape,not_removed,yes please i would vote so hard for that
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,i support
2007scape,not_removed,farming is a buyable
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think anybody considers cooking a buyable since the most efficient way to train the skill is profitable
2007scape,not_removed,your missing out on crafting and construction aswell
2007scape,not_removed,whats the difference its just cosmetic i dont see the issue other than driving the prices of the skills up which in turn makes skilling more profitable
2007scape,not_removed,farming isnt something you can get exp in a day not even moving a single step though
2007scape,not_removed,wines arent profitable bud
2007scape,not_removed,that makes it even worse
2007scape,not_removed,construction i would probs be okay with crafting your right there construction would act as a big money sink due to people spending gp on butlers unnoting items and you could even argue planks
2007scape,not_removed,good point
2007scape,not_removed,wines are around xphr according to cml karambwans are up to xphr even karambwans are better than wines heres a vid of ned flanders doing karambwans without ahk
2007scape,not_removed,how so
2007scape,not_removed,although smithing gets money out of the game aswell and isnt op exp gaining
2007scape,not_removed,god that is such a shit way to do cooking afk all the way
2007scape,not_removed,because you can get a pet from training a really skill for which you wont even need to leave the ge and youd even profit from it that makes it not even a buyable pet rather a free one
2007scape,not_removed,construction makes planks leave the game you build and destroy nothing is left smithing turns resources into gp after things are created they either get alched or sold to a store for gp
2007scape,not_removed,using the bake pie spell is a pretty good training method if you want to get afk cooking xp summer pies are better xphr and more afk than wines
2007scape,not_removed,yeah fuck making profit off of skill with pets thats why we dont have runecrafting theiving mining woodcutting firemaking pvm agility clue scroll hunter or fishing pets oh wait thats litterally all pets in the game
2007scape,not_removed,runecrafting is really slow to train and all skilling pets you mentioned have such a small chance that it on average takes hundreds of hours to obtain one hunter is limited to chinchompas and is a not a bankstanding skill b lots of people are competing for the same chins the firemaking pet is a boss pet wintertodt only not obtainable from regular firemaking pvm is in no way related to cooking at all the clue scroll literally takes more hours to obtain than all other pets combined assuming average rates i do agree the thieving agility pet makes no sense either but they have the same time investment whether you have a lot of cash or not and even so you are wrong with literally all pets as you forgot the chompy bird which is locked behind an elite diary and the penance pet which is a minigame pet not a skilling pvm pet
2007scape,not_removed,implying that the cooking pet will be quick when the others arent jusy because it is buyable or profitable does not make it easy
2007scape,not_removed,it is fast xphr wise it is profitable and it is afk
2007scape,not_removed,so like theiving
2007scape,not_removed,fishing theiving woodcutting
2007scape,not_removed,thieving is fast and profitable not afk low attention maybe if you trap ardy knights but spam clicking is definitely not afk
2007scape,not_removed,hey person here who got thieving from ardy knights spam clicking is super afkable just click while watching a show constant xp an hour btw got raccoon pet at thieving i didnt even realize it for a really long time since i looked away from the game for so long
2007scape,not_removed,like i said low attention required afk i know you can train thieving without any attention but its still not similar to fishing wc cooking with which you can just go cook something leave the pc to go and fetch some snacks and come back still fishing
2007scape,not_removed,so that dude who has been logged in for days that people are worshipping is just a stuck woodcutting bot
2007scape,not_removed,is this in server
2007scape,not_removed,basically
2007scape,not_removed,yes it was on a server haha
2007scape,not_removed,i understand that guy has reached critical meme status but how did anyone even notice him
2007scape,not_removed,then i quess they were all trying to use the shortcut
2007scape,not_removed,rstand that guy has reached critical meme status but by running from edgeville to the grand exchange lol
2007scape,not_removed,if nobody else helps you i can tomorrow
2007scape,not_removed,iron owlbear msg me and i can hop on my main to help
2007scape,not_removed,if noone has helped within the next hours i may be able to help
2007scape,not_removed,huh thanks for checking out my suggestion p unfortunately sample size isnt really that significant and your method of killing zulrah should determine what gear you need eg doing a house teleport with the rejuv pool every kill reduces the need for food making faster kills much more important than increased tankiness also you said void a couple of times when you meant to say ahrims or vice versa
2007scape,not_removed,this has already been calculated with a dps calculator and ahrims is better even when youre magic
2007scape,not_removed,imo defence bonus on void is so irrelevant only point where range defence matters is magic phase and during that phase you are wearing voidarma
2007scape,not_removed,im not gonna jack off to pixels
2007scape,not_removed,they should make a cape out of that
2007scape,not_removed,oh shit i remember back in like when i was even more of a noob than i am now finding this and just going through the music tracks and listening to them by this waterfall
2007scape,not_removed,so whens jagex releasing runescape special edition
2007scape,not_removed,so majestic
2007scape,not_removed,which mod is this
2007scape,not_removed,i always admire the texture on the pool of water you jump in to go get the god capes
2007scape,not_removed,roddlysatisfying
2007scape,not_removed,looks like skyrim
2007scape,not_removed,makes me think of that river in skyrim where the water moves really fast over this giant submerged rock and everything looked amazing
2007scape,not_removed,i assume you have never been to zeah
2007scape,not_removed,suit yourself unzips
2007scape,not_removed,m e t a e t a
2007scape,not_removed,sick reference
2007scape,not_removed,water cape
2007scape,not_removed,thats thats beautiful
2007scape,not_removed,isnt it already there just grab a helmet and youre there on side note i am really enjoying bit skyrim already war mods coming out if you ever modded skyrim before this you were forced to use a mod that made skyrim use all your memory so big mods like civil war worked now you dont need to do all that and can just install the war mod
2007scape,not_removed,reserved for lvl sailing
2007scape,not_removed,gotta kill a leviathan to obtain it
2007scape,not_removed,deal double damage to those wearing fire cape weak to cabbagefarming cape
2007scape,not_removed,now that im remembering it wasnt it was after the dorgeshun quest line was finished bc the song the chosen commander was my shit
2007scape,not_removed,god bless you good sir
2007scape,not_removed,zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,could be fire cape equivalent for magic provides water runes per casts for burst spells
2007scape,not_removed,fe ggit
2007scape,not_removed,for the new brain space pic
2007scape,not_removed,i remember choosing like super cool edgy names as a kid then i got older and made something more my own then i made something unique and without numbers that i could be proud of at this point i just use intentionally bad names like none of this fauxbadass xxxhalopwn crap just slap chop some nonsense together and garnish it with a two or three digit prime number its like the pajama pants of screen names other people might not respect you but if they really care that much then they werent worth knowing in the first place meanwhile youre wearing pajama pants and its great
2007scape,not_removed,lmao i havent seen that last brain expanding pic
2007scape,not_removed,fe iron solo
2007scape,not_removed,fe male
2007scape,not_removed,the most advanced one has to be the a w q p one
2007scape,not_removed,should be well thought out original name in the first panel
2007scape,not_removed,i cannot stand all the iron names i just dont fucking get it sure maybe for the first year of ironman when people didnt know better but now they do
2007scape,not_removed,lmao a friend keep being you
2007scape,not_removed,fe
2007scape,not_removed,dead shitflinging punk rocker the year he died is mine
2007scape,not_removed,my ign is still an animal name with a few digits after it im so attached to the memories with that name that i cant bear to change it id probably be commonly mistaken for a bot if not for my fashionscape
2007scape,not_removed,is pawfive a good name
2007scape,not_removed,as someone who hangs out in an ironman oriented chat i get so tired of seeing people with fe solo or iron in their name i also get really tired of people asking questions that they can look up on google in seconds especially since most of the people answering are probably doing the same thing
2007scape,not_removed,u n v im still pretty proud of this one
2007scape,not_removed,lowercase having a spaceunderscore and suffixed with numbers man a friend just really owns the joke character name though love him
2007scape,not_removed,im an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,xx
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,what does fe mean
2007scape,not_removed,im out of the loop what does the fe stand for
2007scape,not_removed,it was his tribute to
2007scape,not_removed,my ign is nice names
2007scape,not_removed,give new brain pic source
2007scape,not_removed,no born of osiris pictur down vote
2007scape,not_removed,last one should be zezima smh
2007scape,not_removed,i think more hc irons need to use yolo in their name
2007scape,not_removed,does genderfluids count as a meme name
2007scape,not_removed,you forgot a friends and ismokeair accounts
2007scape,not_removed,who
2007scape,not_removed,well thought out and original name should be top panel thats how the meme works
2007scape,not_removed,do you guys like my name
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,wait a minute does that mean i fall under the first tier too oo
2007scape,not_removed,never seen this one before fucking laughed so hard this one is universe tier
2007scape,not_removed,fe got is taken
2007scape,not_removed,that looks like a head to me
2007scape,not_removed,cum
2007scape,not_removed,i remember discovering that osrs had relaunched and logging into to see if my account had been hacked i log in for the first time since about and discover my display name is something horrifically cringey like it burn initially i read it as le tit burn or something like that ive never been more ashamed of year old me
2007scape,not_removed,dude i had the edgiest name you could possibly have i cringe so hard thinking about it figger naggot
2007scape,not_removed,what is the fe thing about im out of the loop
2007scape,not_removed,ironman detected
2007scape,not_removed,i dont get it either do you really need everyone to know within a split second of seeing you that youre an ironman i know its sort of a meme but its annoying and not funny
2007scape,not_removed,whats the problem with them it makes it really easy for other people to know who you are instead of having to remember that two usernames go to the same person
2007scape,not_removed,thats a long name
2007scape,not_removed,if its your name and you like it then its good
2007scape,not_removed,chemical name for iron
2007scape,not_removed,ferrum from latin
2007scape,not_removed,female
2007scape,not_removed,fucking epieceofshit
2007scape,not_removed,ferrum from latin
2007scape,not_removed,nice name
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,why you lying boy thats over the character limit i even checked the hiscores why do i care this much i guess i just wanted it to be true
2007scape,not_removed,a friend
2007scape,not_removed,this is the unironic original version of the meme
2007scape,not_removed,oh kurwa
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt know was prime
2007scape,not_removed,i was the proud owner of xx killer xx back in god bless year old me
2007scape,not_removed,i had the same thing with xbox last month but you have to pay to change that one so i currently have to live with it
2007scape,not_removed,more like it burn
2007scape,not_removed,i cringe too since thats characters
2007scape,not_removed,hey thats my middle name
2007scape,not_removed,its iron from perioidic table so fe iron
2007scape,not_removed,fe is iron on the periodic and it is used by people who play iron man mode
2007scape,not_removed,watch out dont want him to brag about his accomplishments
2007scape,not_removed,its helpful to find other ironmen like a mating call because who needs normie friends and you cant do anything with normies either cant trade pk boss or any other stuff that normies do so its best to just have iron friends
2007scape,not_removed,go join ironman cc the vast majority are just iron some random ass word iron goku or whatever isnt fucking clever
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,there is no conversation this is precisely how it goes what magic level for ice barrage literally sometimes something they can find in the guidebooks already built into the game in seconds or less a chorus of depending on the question of course most arent so readily known then its over thats not a conversation if youre that desperate for human contact that asking such a question satisfies your need you should go on reddit or something and talk to people there or literally anywhere else youre just wasting peoples time in the cc

2007scape,not_removed,i made a new account to play osrs with no regrets
2007scape,not_removed,no regrets
2007scape,not_removed,first gtag i used was max characters used for max cringe
2007scape,not_removed,without the space its
2007scape,not_removed,np the people that complain about someone elses name are usually the people that bought a name for like bucks off some dude
2007scape,not_removed,youre taking rs clan chat too seriously
2007scape,not_removed,that sounds better from now on fe means forever explaining
2007scape,not_removed,s
2007scape,not_removed,mods ban this disgusting and vulgar bot
2007scape,not_removed,sure but thats not what was posted
2007scape,not_removed,runescape is serious business
2007scape,not_removed,im there to talk to people not to be the middle man between a noob and their google search results
2007scape,not_removed,do you expect anyone to figure out sarcasm out of a word comment
2007scape,not_removed,yes it was obvious
2007scape,not_removed,multitask every time watch a show usually a show ive already seen so i dont have to look at the screen to know whats going on p
2007scape,not_removed,i listen to podcasts lately you dont have to actually watch them usually but they still provide outside entertainment
2007scape,not_removed,watch naruto shippuden
2007scape,not_removed,staring at the osrs character and prayer flicking click click click click zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
2007scape,not_removed,i usually play on accounts at once my ironman and my main been working on making a wyvern alt recently though usually listen to youtube or twitch streams
2007scape,not_removed,im watching orange is the new black right now trying to grind combat skills so tedious
2007scape,not_removed,thats not a bad idea i sometimes play game grumps videos in the background and its kinda a podcast in its own way
2007scape,not_removed,ironman im afraid i dont get the jargon sorry im kinda new to this community
2007scape,not_removed,multitask accounts use an alt for money making purposes keeps you busy while main does afk things
2007scape,not_removed,haha i started watching the same few days ago good show much gains
2007scape,not_removed,yeah this season is boring
2007scape,not_removed,an ironman account is an account that is unable to trade or use the grand exchange pretty much playing runescape solo
2007scape,not_removed,any tips for combat grinding im attacking fenkenstrains experiments right now but it still takes a bit and im so bored p
2007scape,not_removed,idk i thought it had some flaws but overall i like it so far
2007scape,not_removed,always try to do combat trough slayer any combat exp gained without slayer is somewhat wasted as you end up doing slayer with all combat level
2007scape,not_removed,this is your biggest fan this is stan
2007scape,not_removed,whoever commented is shadow banned
2007scape,not_removed,beat me to it
2007scape,not_removed,its ed
2007scape,not_removed,should we tell him
2007scape,not_removed,whats a shadow ban
2007scape,not_removed,it means that if someone comments it appears they commented as normal but nobody else can see it if you look at the all comments right above where you post it wont match the actual number of comments
2007scape,not_removed,so if you die in or below wilderness the slayer mask will disesemble and all the parts including black mask i will be on the ground it used to be if you die in wilderness to a player the mask would be converted to coins for the player to pickup now if you die in wilderness to a player the mask will disesemble and the player who killed you will be able to pickup your black mask rather than it be converted to coins now the real question is when so called player kills you does the mask i instantly lose its charge or does it only lose its charge when picked up by the player example player kills you and gets pjed before they can loot could you return to pick the mask up after seconds also if you die to npc in wildly your slayer helm will drop as a black mask i on the floor
2007scape,not_removed,you should be able to pick the mask up unimbued the mask cant act as items on the ground at once i believe mask i and mask normal are different items yada yada also rings lose their imbue upon death if risked no reason mask would keep it worth mentioning that if helm is colored abby kq kbd and you die risking it in wild you lose that head
2007scape,not_removed,if you protect your slayer helm you will keep it in inv and imbued on death died to a team at ghorrock obelisk and kept slayer helm as with prot item
2007scape,not_removed,dont bot
2007scape,not_removed,to around wrong game loser
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,if you remember or were around for it rsbot was a mirror client and was so successful that jagex absolutely could not detect it back in the hay day they ended up having to take legal action to have the rsbot website shut down that was a sad day but by that point in time i had obtained several billion gold and got a red phat that i still have to this day botted runecraft experience too among other things it was the best so yeah mirror clients are the best and to make it worse most of the clients ive seen out there today are ran by kids been hacked twice on my bots the professionalism isnt there anymore its a shame lol
2007scape,not_removed,whats wrong with assumptions based on data collected isnt that the point of collecting data to draw conclusions
2007scape,not_removed,bots like rid are pretty amazing you should look at the furoms people have gotten using it
2007scape,not_removed,rsbotsnet impsoft was shut down because they distributed a modified version of jagexs client unlike the vast majority of botting clients
2007scape,not_removed,sure i just remember the mirror breaking with rs updates and having to wait for them to fix it
2007scape,not_removed,first its called reflection mirror bot is a made up term reflection is a feature of the java vm just as injection is injection is technically slightly better under extremely niche conditions but requires adjustment on some updates just like reflection the primary reason most third party clients and bots go down after an update is to avoid having any updates screw with their outdated class mapping existing scripts etc the fact of the matter is that while these clients do disable their plugins for a short bit after an update thats just to prevent any potential compatibility issues most of the time they dont require much if any adjustment to work after an update its just a matter of safety
2007scape,not_removed,account sharing is allowed
2007scape,not_removed,although i completely disagree with it account sharing is allowed as long as people arent using it to compete for ranks
2007scape,not_removed,if you havent realized he isnt sharing accounts hes buyingbotting them
2007scape,not_removed,its allowed get this shit out from here
2007scape,not_removed,if you havent realized he isnt sharing accounts hes buyingbottling them
2007scape,not_removed,ach account should only be used by one person never share your account with anyone else doing so will likely get the account banned players may not sell share transfer or lend their account to anyone else players should not accept an account that anybody else offers as they may be stolen and this could lead to your own account being disabled why we have this rule we have this rule as part of our procedures to preserve the integrity of the game and its players hard earned achievements the hiscores are there to measure the achievement of an individual not a group of players or party also if disputes occur or friendships breakdown it can lead to at least one of the parties permanently losing access to the account or having it stripped of wealth and items additionally many of the accounts on sale are stolen and people who share accounts run the risk that the person using the account wont give it back or that the person will break a game rule causing the account to be banned or muted for which the account creator will be accountable source
2007scape,not_removed,go to the link i posted below to the runescape rules its not
2007scape,not_removed,since when i thought that shit was bannable since like
2007scape,not_removed,you can bottle accounts its weird because if you actually follow his channel he is clearly being lent them
2007scape,not_removed,ach account should only be used by one person just like how multilogging used to be bannable this is no longer enforced never share your account with anyone else doing so will likely get the account banned no it wont osrs j mods have confirmed over and over that you can account share except in some specific circumstances eg to gain an unfair advantage in the high scores even though you are using the official runescape site they are rules that are not enforced also when you quote a site actually use some formatting so it is clear you are quoting eg use and quotation marks
2007scape,not_removed,since osrs
2007scape,not_removed,botting you knew what i meant just phone autocorrected secondly if you truly believe people magically lend him accounts im sorry but youre delusional
2007scape,not_removed,account sharing and buying or selling accounts each account should only be used by one person never share your account with anyone else doing so will likely get the account banned players may not sell share transfer or lend their account to anyone else players should not accept an account that anybody else offers as they may be stolen and this could lead to your own account being disabled why we have this rule we have this rule as part of our procedures to preserve the integrity of the game and its players hard earned achievements the hiscores are there to measure the achievement of an individual not a group of players or party also if disputes occur or friendships breakdown it can lead to at least one of the parties permanently losing access to the account or having it stripped of wealth and items additionally many of the accounts on sale are stolen and people who share accounts run the risk that the person using the account wont give it back or that the person will break a game rule causing the account to be banned or muted for which the account creator will be accountable like that
2007scape,not_removed,actually i had no idea what you meant yeah except ive seen direct evidence that he does get lent accounts it was one of the people who lent it to him clarifying things a while back anyway this is going nowhere so lets leave it at that
2007scape,not_removed,this is gross
2007scape,not_removed,is wwwrunescapecom
2007scape,not_removed,no to smithing smithing dragon weapons shit way to introduce dragon hasta
2007scape,not_removed,aint bad
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the catch
2007scape,not_removed,i would be too thats a pretty sick house
2007scape,not_removed,why were you using an account this low levelled to stake peoples banks
2007scape,not_removed,ppls banks damn you guys must have been rly poor
2007scape,not_removed,lol yep were free money dood
2007scape,not_removed,the account we stakes against was lower than us plus its not like we exactly play every day
2007scape,not_removed,lost night before lol
2007scape,not_removed,its about in coins per person if equal hows that poor
2007scape,not_removed,at combat is kinda poor each should have at least each
2007scape,not_removed,what should i have at combat
2007scape,not_removed,maybe
2007scape,not_removed,i have how do i make
2007scape,not_removed,hey guys just got my hp prayer firecape
2007scape,not_removed,yes but people always say no just to spite pures would never pass
2007scape,not_removed,you cant just unlearn experience like the technology just isnt there man
2007scape,not_removed,make a main prayer get easier levels such as chinning reset prayer
2007scape,not_removed,wow great idea just rip off shit thats in and bring it to osrs but with one tiny change to it man idk how people like you come up with ideas
2007scape,not_removed,like i said certain unlockables could be lockedunusable if skills are reset
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i would vote no
2007scape,not_removed,not in osrs at least
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt hurt at all if you have the money
2007scape,not_removed,the caves has no requirements
2007scape,not_removed,devalues people whove done pray fcapes etc though
2007scape,not_removed,agreed lol
2007scape,not_removed,well you could also argue that tick eating jad devalues the intended purpose of the jad minigame p
2007scape,not_removed,thats neither here nor there im more talking about devaluing peoples achievements
2007scape,not_removed,then again im not sure about jagexs stance on tick eating as pvp tick eating is now fixed but pvm tick eating is still the same yes it could devalue prayer f cape but as i said before an idea could be to make the fire cape unusable if a player reset his or her prayer level prayer f cape wont be davalued if reset accounts of prayer have their fire capes locked
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i suppose if theyd have to do the firecape again then it makes sense i reckon itd fall under engine work especially their many complaints about not being able to stat reset
2007scape,not_removed,yes indeed this was my idea to help fight account sharing which is still an issue at the moment
2007scape,not_removed,two items that i can buy consistently at break even are black dhide body and addy platebody they do have limited buy limits of and respectively though so i put the offer while im doing a slayer task or overnight and alch it when i get on doing alchs daily gets me around exp a day and breaks up the monotony also using a mouse key rather than using a mouse helps if you want to alch more you either need a huge cash stack or you need to spend time watching ge prices and finding the items that dip into profitablity
2007scape,not_removed,credits to the author of this but its a pretty good resource for alching and everything else in the game
2007scape,not_removed,barrows it isnt fast but its a lot of fun and you should make profit
2007scape,not_removed,just maged my slayer tasks also some bursting at pc for the fast xps
2007scape,not_removed,is it possible with my current stats attack str and def also range prayer and obviously mage if its at all possible even if not progitable id love to do it that way
2007scape,not_removed,you should be fine just look up some guides and have fun
2007scape,not_removed,nice of them but is not most of it was very inflated using new treasure trail items that dont have accurate ge price i think last donation ice price cheaked with osbuddy and it was somthing around ge osb prices
2007scape,not_removed,i honestly fucking hate that fake indian doctor dude hes not funny and no one thinks hes funny
2007scape,not_removed,ya i saw that and took the time to calculate just got a message from my friend about that calculated it to still be a total of trades didnt know how inflated those darkness items were
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt give him nothing my igname name is i flip i pretty sure brap has his own reddit account too his twitch name is elitedustlive and i am what the fuck are you on about i just posted to thank the person
2007scape,not_removed,mfw i have like kc and never gotten a trident tentacle or even a pet yet
2007scape,not_removed,im at kc with damn trident in total also have pets jars tents lol
2007scape,not_removed,bot
2007scape,not_removed,you cant have two beavers following you
2007scape,not_removed,and special needs kida golem
2007scape,not_removed,nvm i did my own research and its a bloodhound can be obtained via master clue scrolls chance source osrs wikipedia
2007scape,not_removed,no cat
2007scape,not_removed,perfect chance of death rune cat repost
2007scape,not_removed,the rare master clue bot
2007scape,not_removed,death runes arent a pet
2007scape,not_removed,theres always one
2007scape,not_removed,whoosh
2007scape,not_removed,whoosh
2007scape,not_removed,uhh okay then why are you bashing his comment if you do get the joke
2007scape,not_removed,better to get them now than never grats
2007scape,not_removed,go and get a bigger dick now
2007scape,not_removed,the red and blue cloaks would make a fine addition for those who cannot get a fire cape like some of those suffering from connection issues
2007scape,not_removed,as long as they did something to combat leeching id love to see soul wars on osrs
2007scape,not_removed,but u want to die
2007scape,not_removed,if they cant do jad they have no hope of killing nomad
2007scape,not_removed,yeah nomad was actually challenging and required good gearstats jad can be beaten by level in green dhide
2007scape,not_removed,most of the time its the waves not jad himself
2007scape,not_removed,thats a unique suggestion sounds like itd be pretty cool
2007scape,not_removed,support as long as one can be a cat praise bob perhaps it can be incorporated into the construction overhaul using the symbol in a poh chapel or similar
2007scape,not_removed,dude they would literally have to go in and give your account this name because there are bots set up checking for usernames every second there must be servers with hundreds or thousands of bots set up for various best names which try to create accounts using a lost of names often people trying to sell their best names get sniped they release the name to the buyer by changing their name and before the buyer can change his name the name is taken by one of these bots
2007scape,not_removed,if it has certain words in the name staffmodaids etc or is just a banned name in general etc nobody is allowed to have the name this may be the case for the one youre after
2007scape,not_removed,fair enough i was just making assumptions about how it is accomplished but people for sure do get names sniped in less than a few seconds so i donno whats really going on
2007scape,not_removed,bump
2007scape,not_removed,actually they throttle each ip so every bot would need their own ip a list of names can take over an hour ive written one and it is not worth running it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but no one has ever used the name before to my knowledge
2007scape,not_removed,no its just a video game character named laharl
2007scape,not_removed,why would mike be banned
2007scape,not_removed,if its addable to your friends or ignore list somebody has it on their account if its not on any of the highscores the account itself may have been banned currently banned accounts have their display names bound to them with no way to transfer the name off im not sure if any banned accounts display names will be released when they decide to do an inactivity name wipe so thatll be something for you to keep an eye on
2007scape,not_removed,not sure just is ive heard conflicting stories but the popular one was that it was an exjmods account like how andrew and paul gower had the usernames paul and andrew
2007scape,not_removed,repost
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,anyone else think that map has a face on it
2007scape,not_removed,repost
2007scape,not_removed,what do you mean there are no bots in runescape they are obviously in a very dedicated flax spinning clan with very strict requirements like only crafting no combat weird names no talking playing strict dress code bald green pants etc
2007scape,not_removed,what do you mean wtf jagex bots are in this game they get banned by mass every few months whats new here
2007scape,not_removed,suicide bots simple being a former botter this is how it works you know when the staff schedule is like you get bots going run the same script suicide them all for lets say hours with breaks in between and boom you made lets say so usd over the weekend most staff dont work on weekends or the bot busters anyway so i think its mod wealth
2007scape,not_removed,private scripts or someone actually gold farming by hand is unlikely still possible you could easily manage accounts spinning flax at one time
2007scape,not_removed,spinning flax craft is bonk
2007scape,not_removed,its really easy to afk flax on accounts and they pay for themselves with bonds public chat to off just cause im not gonna try keeping up that many conversations leave me alone
2007scape,not_removed,the one he showed has crafting not lmao
2007scape,not_removed,for sure zenyte gear the gear you choose depends mostly on what you do more both are great for their role boots are some of the last things youd buy
2007scape,not_removed,absolutely torture pegasians should be last especially for the price
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,i think the biggest stat difference you will get compared to the inferior item is from primordials
2007scape,not_removed,id argue getting the mage boots quicker than the others is a good bet given how trash the other mage boots in game are coupled with how unusually cheap eternal boots are or were bought mine a while back
2007scape,not_removed,so if ill be trying to learn zulrah soonsolo some gwd bosses should i get anguish i think i should stick with fury for melee because of its def bonuses for now my priorities will be anguish bludgeon and then boots and torture
2007scape,not_removed,i think ill get anguish for now i will use fury when meleeing cuz of its def bonuses
2007scape,not_removed,prims give like str bonus over dragon boots
2007scape,not_removed,ah i see i will be getting those soon then thanks
2007scape,not_removed,about those i got an eternal crystal at kc of cerb so i already have the boots lol
2007scape,not_removed,keep in mind the offensive bonus from torture wjll allow you to kill stuff faster and save you more hp than fury but yes anguish is great
2007scape,not_removed,thing is primordials are superior in every way compared to d boots torture is not
2007scape,not_removed,torture has a better stat boost than primordials anguish is by far the biggest dps boost but most people use ranged less than melee so up to you how to prioritize that
2007scape,not_removed,true this is why im aiming to get better range gear for now since i dont have a necklace specific for range i usually use fury
2007scape,not_removed,torture also has no def bonus and no pray bonus thx for the downvotebtw lmao
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt downvote you for most things dps is much more important than defense and prayer so yeah the torture is a better improvement
2007scape,not_removed,torture ammy gives pray
2007scape,not_removed,make splashing great again nmz
2007scape,not_removed,it does stop simple macrosautoclickers there is no reason to remove it most players will only rarely if ever encounter it and relogging in is no problem once every
2007scape,not_removed,thank you for reminding me that i also should afk monks while playing legion
2007scape,not_removed,gz
2007scape,not_removed,i should afk more i did start maining a hunter anyway
2007scape,not_removed,send me a picture of ya butthole and ill buy you membership
2007scape,not_removed,tits or gtfo
2007scape,not_removed,probs a stolen picture probs a girl
2007scape,not_removed,thats a guy fyi
2007scape,not_removed,just give me the fucking cat
2007scape,not_removed,if only chris knew
2007scape,not_removed,now whats a synonym of cat pictures of her cat pictures of her insert synonym
2007scape,not_removed,if i was her id google a butthole pic and send it to you its not like you can confirm it anyway lol
2007scape,not_removed,honestly why would you want to see a butthole
2007scape,not_removed,bomb ass name dicks out for harambe
2007scape,not_removed,no he said she was a girl kelly wouldnt lie on the internet
2007scape,not_removed,reverse pic search through databases usually turns up a fake picture
2007scape,not_removed,hey man some people are born gay and some are born butthole lovers its just life ya know
2007scape,not_removed,guessing that you have done this before
2007scape,not_removed,im just saying i think if you were going to ask for nudes youd ask for something better than a butthole
2007scape,not_removed,twas the life of a year old with kik
2007scape,not_removed,something better than a butthole huh
2007scape,not_removed,how dare you buttholes need attention too
2007scape,not_removed,butthole lives matter
2007scape,not_removed,ive actually done the helo dunker its pretty fun lol
2007scape,not_removed,this is the runescape sub
2007scape,not_removed,me too i failed it twice just so i could do it again lol
2007scape,not_removed,who cares
2007scape,not_removed,i feel like theres not even hours worth of content submitted here each day
2007scape,not_removed,dont be a child and have self control
2007scape,not_removed,you can delete your reddit account
2007scape,not_removed,have self control is a very reasonable idea
2007scape,not_removed,unsubscribe
2007scape,not_removed,theres certain google chrome add ons that block certain websites to deactivate them you have to type a whole paragraph on why procrastinating is bad which makes you feel silly about trying to deactivate it
2007scape,not_removed,you can block reddit
2007scape,not_removed,well we can start by taking your cash
2007scape,not_removed,seriously i go through the content on here in like minutes and then i dont come back until at least hours later
2007scape,not_removed,if youre rich then do dbones if not do ensouled heads
2007scape,not_removed,if going for slayer and such youll get a lot of xp passively via training slayer w bonecrusher especially in catacombs ensouled heads is cheap alternative to dbones but you need favor
2007scape,not_removed,ensouled bloodveld heads are really good personally i did dbones at ectofuntus to get tokens for bonecrusher
2007scape,not_removed,use dbones with a gilded alter best xp
2007scape,not_removed,are there any ensouled head guide videos
2007scape,not_removed,true haha but for the new prayers and base stat goal i want for now in the mean time would get me to from
2007scape,not_removed,do you think with they can get me to prayer
2007scape,not_removed,autumn elegy on youtube i did ensouled giant heads from prayer
2007scape,not_removed,do you want me to google that for you or can you do that yourself
2007scape,not_removed,you need xp so not if using dbones on guilded alter using mid to high tier necromancy believe so iirc its like gp per xp compared to dbones at though id price check yourself to make sure
2007scape,not_removed,yes if you have mory diaries i still suggest that you just do daily x dbones at ecto if you dont need the levels right away bone crusher is so good in catacombs
2007scape,not_removed,i already googled it and i cant seem to find any efficient ones
2007scape,not_removed,autumnelegy made a video comparing ensouled heads to altar in terms of exphr id imagine he did a great run through there
2007scape,not_removed,i did ensouled bloodveld heads from and then from a while after that you equip a dueling ring and whatever armorpreferrably dhide ir whichevrr armor maxes your mage defense and weapons you will use your inventory should have bloodveld heads and a slayer ring and a dramen staff and rune pouch start at castle wars or any bank use slayer ring for rellekka slayer cave and then use fairy ring to dark altar on zeahcode cis kill all ensouled bloodvelds and then tp using dueling ring to castlewars rinse and repeat i averaged xph using this method
2007scape,not_removed,max strength and cannon super combat and antifire every bank trip flick piety ezpz
2007scape,not_removed,i already have the method lunar staff equipped quest cape rune pouch i just need to know what heads to use ive made the decision using bloodveld heads now ill be using melee so ill have bandos or if not for bloodvelds ill use dhidekarils still they have hp so faster kills less damage im assuming ive got it all out after a little lol thanks for the info though
2007scape,not_removed,what about avas accumulator doesnt that increase the number of shots per dartbolt changing the cost crystal bow doesnt benefit from accumulator does this make it even less worthwhile to use
2007scape,not_removed,interesting statistics i think it would be worthwhile to continue doing some math with avas assuming of the ammo is recovered secondly i think you should take attack speed into account to see how much money you spend per hour first calculate how many cross bow shots can be done in an hour and then how many dart hits can be done in an hour then calculate costs
2007scape,not_removed,itd be really cool if you could include avas and approximate gpxp on a low def monster like sandcrabs
2007scape,not_removed,if avas worked with crystal bow could it become an actual viable weapon
2007scape,not_removed,ah yes avas device completely forgot about it unfortunately there is no official return rates for ammo and im not that dedicated to this to go test it myself but yes avas would greatly reduce costs note i added an addendum
2007scape,not_removed,assuming you get ammo back s would be ammo multiplied by per broad bolt shots comes out to per shot using this same math for toxic blowpipe you get per shot edit is incorrect supposed to be
2007scape,not_removed,itd probably end up broken as fuck
2007scape,not_removed,of ammo is recovered something like breaks drops on the ground if you want rough numbers thats for broad bolts but i think its fair to assume that rate for darts
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think thats correct the main cost to use the blowpipe comes from scales so even if you used an attracter it would still cost over in scales alone then factor in darts
2007scape,not_removed,darts may break more than broad bolts some people speculate that different metal ammo will break at different rates like bronze vs rune which would probably apply when it comes to broad bolts vs mithril darts but again all speculation
2007scape,not_removed,oh right so per mithril dart shot per shot per toxic blowpipe shot
2007scape,not_removed,i actually remember reading a jmod specify that the break rate of an arrow is no matter what kind i would assume darts and bolts are the same but thats my two cents a tho bro
2007scape,not_removed,i have no idea how this reddit stuff works btw so no hatin plz seems like a cool idea to be followed by a small skeleton maybe a small drop chance at superior slayer encounters
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,i used to dream i would have the stats to wear full ahrims and the money to buy spammable ice barrages for castle wars those guys looked so powerful i just never got there
2007scape,not_removed,i used to run around in castle wars with it when i was like if thats what you meant lol
2007scape,not_removed,most of us were when desert treasure came out so no not really lol
2007scape,not_removed,bounty hunter craters with no bh skull lmao
2007scape,not_removed,i would use my school red textbook as a zammy book and id fashion a dds out of some paper then proceed to cast blitz and spec out my friends
2007scape,not_removed,first place i ever saw a whip was in castle wars was funny because a friend at school that same day was talking about how there was a new whip weapon and i was like no way
2007scape,not_removed,lol so was i p
2007scape,not_removed,bh crater was around after they removed it when bh worlds and pvp worlds were out bh craterbh bank were hot spots for pking still especially since bh bank was multi and a common bank spot for dragon trainersdragon pkers being you could teleport to it using a games necklace and since clan wars was right across the valley you could also use a games neck to tele there the crater itself was singles so it was a good way to escape especially considering the lesser demons ankous and skeletons you could use to hit off your attackers
2007scape,not_removed,i guess i was boring lol
2007scape,not_removed,not right when pvp came out it was still there just disabled and it was around this time wilderness volcano came around bh worlds
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah true that was so long ago i have so many memories multi pking there
2007scape,not_removed,why not make it so that medium diary done bag drop rate hard done elite done i hate slapping all of the good stuff on diary rewards but this one would be a decent addition i think also while im not a javarunescript expert i assume this would be easier to implement than being able to have multiple bags
2007scape,not_removed,medium wildy diary lets you have looting bags hard and elite possibly you lose bag contents on death as normal
2007scape,not_removed,just kill the thugs under edgeville it takes less than minutes
2007scape,not_removed,buy a kill from someone then u can just buy looting bags from shop its more efficient than wasting time at thugs or we although killing vettion is pretty good if your pet hunting rollskill for looting bag
2007scape,not_removed,easy diary using wildy sword med using wildy sword hard using wildy sword elite using wildy sword this not only gets you easier looting bags but also gives more use to the wildy swords
2007scape,not_removed,looting bag wasnt really designed for pvm rather for looting i guess but the diary thing would be nice
2007scape,not_removed,lets just give an option to bank wherever why not
2007scape,not_removed,this would make uim mode even worse currently looting bag is balanced decently in uim perspective only thing that i would update is the droprate it could be more common or even ℅ drop
2007scape,not_removed,multiple bags would be quite easy however letting those bags have separate storage is a whole different matter
2007scape,not_removed,i dont use looting bags much and im normally against ideas that make the game easier per say i actually really like this idea though youve already put in your hours grinding insane stats for an elite diary dont make us waste time getting more looting bags
2007scape,not_removed,my luck is not the best i do do that but the fact that i have to go farm it every time is annoying
2007scape,not_removed,looting bag is not even close to banking what are you smoking
2007scape,not_removed,you can already say bank ingame
2007scape,not_removed,sure if the community wants it
2007scape,not_removed,holding more looting bags wouldnt mean you can use them all only can hold items at any given time has no impact on uim
2007scape,not_removed,is pretty damn common
2007scape,not_removed,yeah thats where the issue would come from as of course it wouldnt be good to let people run around with looting bags full of stuff
2007scape,not_removed,how often do you die
2007scape,not_removed,your luck is the same as the rest of ours man lol
2007scape,not_removed,the good shit
2007scape,not_removed,it also doesnt nee an jncreased drop rate seeing as though every dropping monster is
2007scape,not_removed,best solution i can think of is making separate items the empty looting bag dropped by monsters in the wild you can have multiple at a time and it can be filled but as soon as item enters it it turns into filled looting bag or used looting bag or something along those lines this item would behave the same as the current looting bag and would turn back into the empty one once emptied and if you tried to fill am empty one while a different bag is used itd say why fill up another if you have a perfectly good one laying around
2007scape,not_removed,👌🔥🔥👌
2007scape,not_removed,it gives you a second inventory in wilderness only that you cant take things out of or manipulate until you get to a bank no imp in a box is the closest
2007scape,not_removed,seemsgoodjpg
2007scape,not_removed,amen
2007scape,not_removed,lol nice try
2007scape,not_removed,i recently went from like to for an elite clue mainly to get it out of the way cash wise under time wise under an hour potions prayer potions ranarr snape grass is fairly cheap but you cant really buy supplies in bulk unless you have cash super energies avantoe mort myre fungus a lil more expensive than prayer pots but you can buy the supplies with a small cash stack serum tarromin and ashes each dirt cheap slowest exp
2007scape,not_removed,i was making pots profit off of prayer pots last night so you might want to try that
2007scape,not_removed,yes it is
2007scape,not_removed,theyre annoying
2007scape,not_removed,they used to beassuming somewhere along the lines there was a poll for it if it passed to switch it to dosile you can probably bet a poll to revert it would not pass however i love aggressive random afk skillers free loot free loot best loot
2007scape,not_removed,i do miss looting from folks who went afk too long but now thats not possible they got rid of that to discourage ddos attacks
2007scape,not_removed,you cant get loot from it anymore because of the current death mechanics
2007scape,not_removed,it will make a difference botters will have to either do all the quests manually which will be super annoying and a timewaste or pay people to quest for them which costs money or buy a quest script which isnt cheap then they will lose time by questing wasting their membership making a green dragon bot will be less appealing also will green dragon bots be more valuable since its harder to make them which also makes it less appealing botting on those accounts will be a bigger risk botwatch system can catch the bots before they harm the economy
2007scape,not_removed,it will slow them down because they will have to do quests manually training the stats can be done with another bot
2007scape,not_removed,i highly doubt they will need to do the quests manually did you ever have warped tortoise tasks those were filled with bots and locked behind quests itd just be a larger tutorial island for the bots
2007scape,not_removed,its not meant to stop botters just be another hoop to jump through
2007scape,not_removed,tell us how much time it takes to complete those quests
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,this entire discussion is silly
2007scape,not_removed,it will slow them down for sure
2007scape,not_removed,the point is to slow them down not stop them entirely which is why your logic is flawed
2007scape,not_removed,botters manually do quests lol gold farmers maybe but theyre not botting at all to begin with
2007scape,not_removed,at best two hours
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,people have come to my cc recently but we dont hunt for the book
2007scape,not_removed,if i can get some constructive criticism on what to dochangeetc thatd be great
2007scape,not_removed,right after we get instanced dks
2007scape,not_removed,only cause you asked nicely
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,sometime november is all i heard
2007scape,not_removed,ive read about hcim last week thats why im back to lurking osrs subreddits after i tried to quit like a half year ago
2007scape,not_removed,shortly after the australian servers i presume
2007scape,not_removed,you are
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,its and still not using screenshots
2007scape,not_removed,in case the image is too bad this was my medium
2007scape,not_removed,rot
2007scape,not_removed,rot tho
2007scape,not_removed,try ns latino
2007scape,not_removed,better than stepping on an ied i guess
2007scape,not_removed,you guys actually have sugar on deployment
2007scape,not_removed,only losers put sugar in their coffee
2007scape,not_removed,touche you have a point
2007scape,not_removed,lol yes i know some dont my first we didnt
2007scape,not_removed,to each their own were drinking this nasty organic shit if i had my black rifle coffee co i wouldnt use anything
2007scape,not_removed,got warrior rings zerk ring and rol so far and a rdt drop and a
2007scape,not_removed,this is the best one imo i like the inventory icon for it and it has a simple design like most of the original dragon items
2007scape,not_removed,needs some pink or a green pixel or something
2007scape,not_removed,id be very happy with this its a shame jagex seem to shy away from the more simple designs they honestly fit in a lot better with the rest of old schools content
2007scape,not_removed,well that does look like a dragon sword
2007scape,not_removed,edge
2007scape,not_removed,it looks sad
2007scape,not_removed,only good suggestion on here
2007scape,not_removed,too frilly imho
2007scape,not_removed,at least she was hot though right
2007scape,not_removed,lmao no fgt
2007scape,not_removed,at first i instantly thought no and then i remembered dragons droppin a shit ton of bars and thought yah ok then i remembered one of the diaries makes them drop noted and nah again but finally i reached the conclusion it wouldnt be that bad of an idea if it degrades and dissappears and is a semi rare drop i guess but then would it even be worth using depending on the price fuck i give up idk lol
2007scape,not_removed,anything that makes metal dragons less irrelevant is a good thing imo
2007scape,not_removed,wrong game sir
2007scape,not_removed,getting noted drops would still be preferable also its the elite karamja diary so that is a pretty small player base and its only for brimhaven dungeon
2007scape,not_removed,i totally agree there are plenty of other monsters that drop bars though so it would have a wide range of use but the most obvious is metal dragons
2007scape,not_removed,i sell my soul to rot for protection and hide
2007scape,not_removed,get killed by nig nog with firebolt
2007scape,not_removed,put some effort into it maybe rot might see it and like what u think p
2007scape,not_removed,why do accounts need antidragon shields im really confused not too big on the pking scene
2007scape,not_removed,i think the main point here is that we have to stop oppressing olgas and other tribespeople they raided my village for drugs and started enslaving us with their money to us is far more than to them we lost our group identity in a push for short term monetary gain the enforcement officers have left since but there needs to be a change what im proposing is that instead of getting help from the government to preserve our culture we should get money from them to expand its presence we should be given a spot at multi cultural events rather than being supported in hopes that we stay in our box i will not rest until were recognized as people and not just burdens e since some people asked no we dont have a sigil
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure bots would just have the quest scripted mod weath was asked about it and he said he doubts it would have too positive an impact i like green dragons for dmmlow levels you can literally tell someone go kill dragons and its a legitimate low req high money maker for many people starting i know mmk said hed come up with some data on the subject the first time it was brought up i would hope he could read into it before a repoll or hotfix an important number would be how many legitimate players wear antidragon sheilds without dragon slayer started i can assure you bots will have it done and it may only impede them by a few hours but players may face a much longer hurdle since they cant automate specifically for that purpose
2007scape,not_removed,i still feel like a large majority of people who said no are ones that are too afraid that this update will increase the price of dragon bones too much and make it harder for them to train prayer so i doubt this compromise would solve anything
2007scape,not_removed,support i absolutely fucking dread quests and would sooner just stop making pking accounts than do them since it seems imminent that this update gets forced through this seems a lot better than just forcing us to do this on every single account
2007scape,not_removed,this would turn my no into a yes
2007scape,not_removed,should also not be changed at all on dmm
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt make me happy i want my old model antidragon shield back so back to the drawing board ace good luck next year
2007scape,not_removed,i would like to see hours at the ditch in we the pking world is and someone to count how many antidragon shields they even see being used i would wager it is not many also why not give the chronical some stats or give anothermaby better option for the off hand insted of overcomplicateing the antidragon shield
2007scape,not_removed,pkers who havent done drag slayer still need the shield to block dragon bolts e
2007scape,not_removed,i believe that we will already reach after jagex reviews the poll question also do i not understand people who vote no because they dont want the dragon bone price to go up do we put ourselves above the integrity of the game do we put botters who earn real money off of rs above this poll question its a logical thought maybe people are egoistic but still for me it is sad to see that people want to have bots instead of seeing them gone also will killing green dragons be a better money making method for legit players so d bone price wont be affected that much isnt d bone price also linked to wyvern bones and we have new prayer training methods which will become more viable
2007scape,not_removed,suggestion actually ban them
2007scape,not_removed,on my low level pker account i dont have any quests done at all i just use it to pk its a ranger and a lot of the fights i get people use dragon bolts specs on me the one that burns you or the dfs as a spec weapon by unleashing its dragonfire attack back at me im not super rich so i aint spending an extra on my trip bringing an antifire so i just use the adfs as my shield slot and rune cbow as my weapon and then i negate that special attack from hitting me for a high nbsp now i know this sub hates pures for whatever reason and i do play a main and an ironwoman skiller but i love that shield and i always have my mage pure trains on green dragons for extra money so i can afford pk supplys and its good exp because they have high defence and i cant imagine pking without my shield i voted no and i know ill get down voted to hell for not having the popular opinion but thats why i wouldnt change to a yes
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,i support this compromise i was one of those who voted no as i wasnt sold on the idea that the original proposition wouldve been a long term solution to green dragon bots especially considering that quest bots have existed for years one post here on this subreddit even showed a gd bots script mentioning having done dslayer already the original update seemed unnecessarily punishing for mages and the like and while i still dont think this would take very long for bots especially sweatshop goldfarmers to catch up this version of an antibotting measure at least considers the scene and seems harmless at worst would be interesting to see mod weath weigh in with his opinion on this id like to see the retroactive completion of dragon slayer for those whove done it negate the need to speak to duke horacio as id rather not see legitimate players go and get killed from a new requirement they werent aware of as no matter well advertised youd get those who would hear of it and end up killed anyways
2007scape,not_removed,i guess if youre and dont like questing you wont be killing any dragons anytime soon
2007scape,not_removed,this is a great idea
2007scape,not_removed,i havent played in months kinda confused about whats going on will this affect defense pures
2007scape,not_removed,no support just let it be
2007scape,not_removed,itt botters crying about this idea
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,a post on the front page which isnt a meme this is rare
2007scape,not_removed,i got downvoted for suggesting this in the other threads
2007scape,not_removed,but what about the fact that it wont protect low levels from dragons
2007scape,not_removed,that works i have another simple compromise what about the original idea but also releasing a cheap better bis magic shield obviously it wouldnt have the anti dragon capabilities but that wouldnt matter to a pure
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think pkpers actually use this shield considering any serious pker only uses handed weapons being their bow and
2007scape,not_removed,you dont make changes to appease some stupid meta pass it as is
2007scape,not_removed,upvoted for shafted
2007scape,not_removed,im all for annoying the bots but what about antifire pots
2007scape,not_removed,if it takes you hrs to get qp youre doing it wrong
2007scape,not_removed,good idea i support this
2007scape,not_removed,or you know make it so that is not affected by it and if they hop to equip the shield and hop back to members it would make the shield buff nonactive causing them to still take fire damage
2007scape,not_removed,so pures would only have to start the quest to start using the shield with the dragonfire protect in effect
2007scape,not_removed,this should have been their first suggestion it probably would have gotten more yes votes
2007scape,not_removed,can we have them remove dragons from slayer tasks if the quest has not been completed otherwise seems like a good idea
2007scape,not_removed,this doesnt solve having to do a bunch of quests nobody wants to do over again on any alts just accept that the poll failed jesus
2007scape,not_removed,where did this idea that the pures were to blame for this not passing literally only read it here on reddit i pk a ton and havent seen person complain or even mention it
2007scape,not_removed,good idea
2007scape,not_removed,nice support
2007scape,not_removed,troof
2007scape,not_removed,was someone who voted no originally but i can support this idea for sure doesnt harm legitimate players but players should probably have dragon tasks disabled until they can access the quest so basically at qp you gain dragon tasks
2007scape,not_removed,just make it so they have to complete the quest to use it itll stop all bots and deter bot makers from making more accounts itll help the economy so much make a new shield for people if they care that much just dont make it able to negate dragonfire why am i even making an effort with this jmods wont do shit they get far too much revenue from bots
2007scape,not_removed,changing an item to stop type of bot is jsut retarded why dont we put a quest req for fishing nets to stop fishing bots total level req to use wc axethis is beyond mei dont understand itonly way is to better the bot detection software
2007scape,not_removed,this doesnt address why people voted no though pray is too expensive and this update would only increase the gpxp of it just saying
2007scape,not_removed,whow nice really good thinking
2007scape,not_removed,yes please
2007scape,not_removed,wont bots just use antidragon fire potions instead
2007scape,not_removed,how hard is it to understand that people voted no because they dont want prayer to be gpexp
2007scape,not_removed,lmao pkers
2007scape,not_removed,stop trying to change the games lore for the sake of your deluded fucking antibot agenda
2007scape,not_removed,solution make it a requirement to finish the quest to wear the sheild but at the same time add a new sheild to the game with the same stats but no dragon fire protection
2007scape,not_removed,i find it halarious that if pking is one of the reasons it was stopedwhy if the change came into place your back to square one with you either have the shield or dont on both sides
2007scape,not_removed,there is no situation it was polled and it failed you cant just keep repolling the same things with a little variation until by some ungodly power it passes
2007scape,not_removed,why do accounts need antidragon shields im really confused not too big on the pking scene they are the bis shield for certain pures
2007scape,not_removed,ughatiapoisson edited his comment his original comment was as follows thats a good concept upvoted yes good concept i disagree with op at the end however even after the botters make a questing script and this update doesnt matter questing scripts are bound to be very complex and botters would need a large number of them on each bot to complete all the required quests there is a chance that this will increase jagexs detection and banning of bots to some degree this update is huge and will always matter
2007scape,not_removed,wat
2007scape,not_removed,am i reading this right what do tribespeople and multicultural events have to do with the ads im super tired sorry if im saying stupid stuff this just makes sense right now
2007scape,not_removed,wat
2007scape,not_removed,no widgets or dragons allowed please
2007scape,not_removed,uhhh
2007scape,not_removed,i can assure you bots will have it done and it may only impede them by a few hours but players may face a much longer hurdle since they cant automate specifically for that purpose why cant this entire sub think in the long term like this
2007scape,not_removed,they should just make a random appear on wildly green dragons that is lethal if you dont do it right after tries if you do it right you get a dragon head or dragon bones and hide
2007scape,not_removed,this i truely do not believe a quest req for the shield solves anything quests are just as repetitive as regular gameplay and bots will have no issue doing fast high qp quests
2007scape,not_removed,very true that and dmm players who like getting prayer levels asap at lava dragons
2007scape,not_removed,honestly though the quests could all be done within hours it doesnt seem so bad to me
2007scape,not_removed,this actually answers my main objection only dragon in is elvarg but would this be doable or is this engine work
2007scape,not_removed,this this is one of the main reasons i voted no its not a walk in a park to get quest points to kill dragons people kill greenbluelava dragons within hours of the start of every dmm nobody wants to do more quests on dmm
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,if you voted no it is because you are a botter you dont want bones to go up nothing else
2007scape,not_removed,whilst i understand the concept of your argument antifire potion are each dose for a fight is thats negligible cost when considering sharks are and if you choose a cheaper method monkfish are
2007scape,not_removed,we hate people who think the game caters to pures
2007scape,not_removed,anytime soon quest take hours to complete with the approprita telwports ready
2007scape,not_removed,because you didnt make a pretty picture in microsoft paint using a black background yellow runescape font and pictures of items gotta appeal to the subs add yo
2007scape,not_removed,antifires are cheap
2007scape,not_removed,yeah they would definitely take advantage of this given time to adapt maybe antifire pots would require this same technique this whole approach might not even work because botters could make scripts to level them up and get quests done for dragon slayer
2007scape,not_removed,you might have missed the point
2007scape,not_removed,theres a reason why baby dragons exist
2007scape,not_removed,thats an even better idea just give dragons a qp requirement
2007scape,not_removed,they are just desperate they think this is going solve all forms of botting from green drags to red chins to wines of zammy to karamja fishing its absurd this subcommunity is literally retarded
2007scape,not_removed,did you even read my post i think the antibot antidragon shield update isnt going to work im just offering this as middle ground so when it inevitably gets forced through it wont fuck pkers in the long run thanks for your feedback though
2007scape,not_removed,i see you raging at every antidragon shield related post what lore what is the lore that you will need and be given an antidragon shield to kill elvarg a dragon in the quest dragon slayer which requires quest points to start why give access to wear the shield before that point
2007scape,not_removed,if you need to finish dragon slayer to equip the shield then how are you gonna slay the dragon
2007scape,not_removed,buff wooden shield
2007scape,not_removed,it was stopped because the idea is stupid and impacts regular players more than bots even if only of the player base realizes it
2007scape,not_removed,i laughed so you got an upvote from me at least
2007scape,not_removed,i personally think updating the shield to force players to start dragon slayer is stupid and will do more harm than good after a scripter makes a questing script a week or two after the update with enough backlash the update will go through its happened before and when that happens this wont make it shitty for players in the long run you cant just keep repolling the same things with a little variation until by some ungodly power it passes this is entirely incorrect explain to me how repolled content like pets are in the game the community is indecisive about fucking everything
2007scape,not_removed,why is making compromises a bad thing it didnt pass the poll but come on over of the player base voted in favor of it if little tweaks are made to appease the pkers then it seems like the only people left impacted are botters and people who are incredibly selfish about pray xp costs im fine with both groups of people being fucked over they deserve it
2007scape,not_removed,def pures that are using or are against mage other than that iron kiteshield trumps it that is how small of a niche this legit complaint is mage pures more or less
2007scape,not_removed,oh
2007scape,not_removed,game doesnt cater to pures
2007scape,not_removed,questing scripts arent very complex and difficult only as complex as the actual quest itself is
2007scape,not_removed,a questing script that does quests already exists you just start it at a bank with all the req items in bank and it goes to work couple hours later its completed all the quests you chose
2007scape,not_removed,op edited his comment to nonsense
2007scape,not_removed,his comment said something different previously but he edited it the cheeky bugger
2007scape,not_removed,hes drawing the parallel between and tribespeople along with drugs and botters
2007scape,not_removed,he edited his comment
2007scape,not_removed,yeee
2007scape,not_removed,lmao do you honestly think not a single person thought of that hey what if what if they botted the quests too brainblast the whole point is that the extra effort along with the fact that they are botting quests will make them easier to catch nobody actually believed that people would sit down and manually complete all the quests for each one of their botting accounts
2007scape,not_removed,because the easy answer is the one t hat gets repeated and it becomes a ridiculous echo chamber if you disagree you support bots or bot thats the rhetoric now and thats what earns upvotes instead of understanding that the issue is much deeper and this may hurt legitimate players much more than were willing to admit while barely bothering bots in the long term heres weath basically making it clear that its nice in theory and will definitely have a short term effect but the chances are bots will adapt and theres already quest line bots so theyre already adapted and this will be be only a temporary obstacle at worst for botters while being a potentially massive hurdle for the low levels you see kililng greensblues
2007scape,not_removed,only of the osrs community has a brain
2007scape,not_removed,which bots will be able to do accurately since theyre programmed to whereas legit players may misclick it yeee
2007scape,not_removed,youre forgetting that in that extra hours of botting with more complex scripts them getting banned becomes more likely
2007scape,not_removed,the shield suggestion has no quest req to get it only the dragonfire part chances are if your a member and asking about green dragons your probably already over level and have done the majority or all of quests
2007scape,not_removed,its so unfair how clans of skulled people all buttfuck eachother at lava dragons
2007scape,not_removed,yeah op exaggerate much lol
2007scape,not_removed,its torturous without teleports agility money for the ge it is awful and lowlevel mage pures are temporary accounts once they hit a certain level in mage they have to make another one this would hurt them especially it takes way longer than two hours in a fresh account making a defense pure for the rune platebody took up most of my day and i did them all in a pretty efficient order an update like restricting the shield is just going to end up like random events it will combat bots for a little while and then just become completely irrelevant for them once a questing script is made then it will just be a nuisance for us legit players id really not like to suffer the consequences of this update for years to come after bots dont give a shit about it
2007scape,not_removed,please make a hour unbroken video of you doing the quests with a new account off tutorial island that you didnt transfer gold to im betting you cant but go ahead show me
2007scape,not_removed,or if you play dmm and want to kill dragons without hours of quests in the way
2007scape,not_removed,not fucking worth doing manually
2007scape,not_removed,i know it was an exaggeration was just a little extreme takes like minutes
2007scape,not_removed,well iron and steel baby dragons dont
2007scape,not_removed,you think any solution is gonna stop everything you are retarted if you want to make a change you have to make small changes at a time
2007scape,not_removed,no its a first step to try out and to see if we are able to tackle green dragon bots like this
2007scape,not_removed,its not going to get forced through
2007scape,not_removed,why use halfassed in game requirements to combat botting also im not raging im celebrating cause this shit failed x this sub seems to be raging tho
2007scape,not_removed,mage pray and anti dragon fire potion or a shit load of hp and food
2007scape,not_removed,name one situation a regular player needs this shield that doesnt involves low level pking because post update none of them would have it so no one has a advantage over another
2007scape,not_removed,it will be easier to detect the bots with the requirement which is one of the benefits
2007scape,not_removed,why not just create a new shield with similar or better stats then add the quest requirement to the dragon shield
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i mean you dont even pure pk so why should anyone care
2007scape,not_removed,the game also shouldnt take things away from pures if it isnt needed
2007scape,not_removed,questing scripts arent very complex and difficult only as complex as the actual quest itself is let me put this a clearer way what do you think will have the largest affect in making detecting and banning bots easier option a leave things as they are nothing changes current green dragon bots are as detectable as normal option b force all green dragon bots to bot multiple large quests before going back to regular botting questing scripts especially when used in a large scale like they will have to be used will be relatively easy for jagex to detect thus green dragon bots chances of getting banned are substantially increased questing scripts arent very complex and difficult only as complex as the actual quest itself is questing scripts are by their nature more complex and difficult than green dragon botting scripts as long as we go with the longer quests there is a chance that this update will make detecting bots easier
2007scape,not_removed,and youve got to be high mate if you dont think that will not be very detectable when used in mass
2007scape,not_removed,people also dont realize that botters treat accounts like a product and will simply stack accounts with the requirements for the shield for example botter a will bot on multiple accounts killing green dragons while he can manually play on other accounts to get the reqs this will give him reserves in case any of his current bots are banned making the delay time to start botting again yes initially we will see the poll work probably but after a week or so itll be back to normal
2007scape,not_removed,the whole point is that the extra effort along with the fact that they are botting quests will make them easier to catch nobody actually believed that people would sit down and manually complete all the quests for each one of their botting accounts botting quests wont make them any easier to catch theyll only get caught when they are either training their accounts to the point where it can kill dragons or while killing dragons who the hell is actually going to question every person walking from point a to point b on a quest as being a bot the detection system lmao
2007scape,not_removed,the whole point is that the extra effort along with the fact that they are botting quests will make them easier to catch weath said this will not happen gg
2007scape,not_removed,why extra effort lmfao i was coding dung scripts for friends back in as a high school student spend a couple hours per quest add some randomization in the walking so it doesnt look like bots following the same path and never worry about it again some quests dorics cooks assistant imp catcher are literally buy x item on ge bring to y npc really thing thats going to stop anyone scripts get sharedsold and in a month every not farm will have one leaving us back where we started sad so many people are misinformed
2007scape,not_removed,httpstwittercomjagexweath ultimateklaxon find a way around it this message was created by a bot
2007scape,not_removed,only make stuff up
2007scape,not_removed,there are currently things that exist that bots can not do just use a fucking captcha like everyone else
2007scape,not_removed,hours quests complex
2007scape,not_removed,you are forgetting how long they spend training the stats up to kill the green dragons hours extra isnt much at all
2007scape,not_removed,people make throwaway accounts on to pk at green drags some people are just noobs and dont have any quests done at all and i dont like suggestions that hurt low level players for no gain
2007scape,not_removed,get qp on a fresh account without teleports and agility and tell me im exaggerating
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah i guess thats true i did them all in hours but ofc i had glory tp mage tp and lots of money to buy ge stuff so that made it a helluva lot easier
2007scape,not_removed,torturous really i literally just went through this exact situation and it took about hours to get enough qp for dragon slayer like holy crap can you over exaggerate anymore
2007scape,not_removed,and lowlevel mage pures are temporary accounts once they hit a certain level in mage they have to make another one why
2007scape,not_removed,its not really i believe the world record for ironman champ guild on is and a half hours
2007scape,not_removed,game doesnt cater to pures
2007scape,not_removed,i said they could be done in hours i didnt say they could be done in hours on a new account
2007scape,not_removed,takes like minutes now thats an exaggeration
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but also some people dont play efficiently because they dont know how or find it more fun to not this person type probably doesnt overlap with pkers much as when one makes an account to pk with its usually used to progress to pk stage as fast as possible whether or not it takes hours if this compromise would get this passed im certainly for it
2007scape,not_removed,should just make it legends quest req that would really stop them
2007scape,not_removed,so basically you dont have an answer to my question its a logical requirement which makes sense in the game lore and will impact green dragon bots besides antibotting software things like reqs can be implemented as well a combination of both we never tried this before and a majority is in favor we just need those bot votes to be deleted
2007scape,not_removed,elvarg maxes out at people arent going to get hp to tank one hit to get an incredibly simple shield
2007scape,not_removed,name one situation beside muh bots that this shield should have a requirement to be worn
2007scape,not_removed,are you autistic
2007scape,not_removed,well this ops suggestion is a good counterargument to anyone saying it hurts legitimate players still has a use makes sense with the lore to learn to counter a dragons breath slows down bots
2007scape,not_removed,bc
2007scape,not_removed,if your suggesting i myself dont pure pk i do i have a def rangestr pure it does not use the antidragonfire shield iron kiteshield is better in every way unless im versing a mager which doesnt happen at my combat
2007scape,not_removed,just gonna drop this here
2007scape,not_removed,yes it will definitely have an effect on bots nobody will argue the opposite the issue is that the effect will be extremely small for a comparatively large annoyance on legit players you know the exact reason people hate drm in gaming too much bullshit for actual customers for too little effect on those its meant to stop its simply not worth it
2007scape,not_removed,option b force all green dragon bots to bot multiple large quests before going back to regular botting questing scripts especially when used in a large scale like they will have to be used will be relatively easy for jagex to detect if jagex has trouble detecting bots who just kill dragons for hours on end not to mention not catching them while they botted the stats to even kill green dragons to begin with i have very low expectations for them to be somehow sniffing out questing bots which is not a repetitive action with more success in the very short time frame in which they do them hopefully ill be wrong and questing scripts are really no big deal they already exist just not for this purpose yet if they can make a bot that do complexity dungeoneering while you sleep in they can make just about anything
2007scape,not_removed,im just speaking from experience
2007scape,not_removed,no it wasnt
2007scape,not_removed,gdks are actually some of the most complex and involved scripts out there due to their heavy use quest scripts are simple as quests especially the ones are very predictable i believe the most likely outcome of your proposed update is little to no effect on bots and a large barrier of entry on a decent moneymaking method where one did not previously exist
2007scape,not_removed,its already being used mate my point is that there literally wont be much downtime since once its passed people already have the solution for the time being
2007scape,not_removed,same can be said for green dragon bots lmao
2007scape,not_removed,im all for making botters manually play quests for all their bot accounts
2007scape,not_removed,or they could just buy a good script and just watch the bots playing theres bot scripts for literally everything if youre in for the business theres no harm in spending with good scripts accounts vps and make tons of profit in the next few months
2007scape,not_removed,if you could slow the bots down for a week with almost no effort by the mods why not do it any chance to piss off botters seems like a good choice to me even if its minor
2007scape,not_removed,do you sincerely believe that is how the bot detection works
2007scape,not_removed,the whole point of scripts is that they do repetitive actions for you with something like green drag or fishing bots they are hard to detect because the action is generally pretty repetitive in the first place if we saw scripts written so that bots could do quests a much less repetitive activity it would be easier to catch them than if they were doing just regular botting activities who the hell is actually going to question every person walking from point a to point b on a quest as being a bot this is just a very disingenuous representation of what may occur as well as how bots are actually detected theres no reason to place under suspicion players who complete a quest every two days for example scripts would involve a very specific and consistent questing order as well as consistent routing and actions afterwards in any case putting more time between botting accounts being created and botting accounts actually being put into action is a good thing
2007scape,not_removed,he actually said it would help at first but that they would eventually find a way around it hey im all for adding an annoyance to botters fuck em
2007scape,not_removed,when
2007scape,not_removed,what dont you understand about slowing the bots down by any amount is a good thing
2007scape,not_removed,bots have been doing captchas for years not even uses them anymore lmao
2007scape,not_removed,we have scripts that use deathbycaptcha to register runescape accounts not to mention most random events are pretty captcha like and have never been a problem
2007scape,not_removed,i just started back up for osrs less than a month ago it took me about hours to do all quests but dragon slayer and shield of arrav with magic and in you are exaggerating
2007scape,not_removed,looks like its time to speed run accounts to and see records fly
2007scape,not_removed,without teleports your fault for not getting magic first which takes less than an hour lol besides the shield is only useful as long as youre being a magic pure up to like combat and even then the defensive stats it provides wouldnt matter much since youre a pure anyways this is literally one of those things nobody notices until its gone and like to make a scandal out of
2007scape,not_removed,ive done it multiple times and youre exaggerating especially because you can buy teleport tabs now quit crying pussy
2007scape,not_removed,some people might have less time to play then others and not the same access to materials hours of your time might be nothing but hours of his time might be all of his free time for video games in a week
2007scape,not_removed,why because it isnt really lowlevel mage pking if you are higher level than everyone else the way your combat level is calculated is based on the highest between your attack and strength your range or your magic if you primarily train magic which levels very fast you will increase in combat level at an incredibly fast rate low level wilderness is very unfriendly toward level discrepancies and it eventually gets to the point where you cant fight anyone and have to make another account
2007scape,not_removed,magic is incredibly powerful at very low levels fire strike can hit up to like at level mage rangestrength can only hit like a magic is also incredibly accurate against low level gear iron armor monks robes or leather all do basically nothing however it peaks at a low level too the max hit increases slowly it has horrible attack speed so you can never ko someone and boltblast spells are incredibly expensive considering theyll never kill anyone who has more than like shrimp in their inv
2007scape,not_removed,yes but there is a difference between absolute fastest most effiencient and of everyone else
2007scape,not_removed,its a reason its the world record
2007scape,not_removed,it also doesnt cater to people bitching on reddit
2007scape,not_removed,it is also possible to beat dark souls in under an hour what is your point
2007scape,not_removed,on a maxxed account with ok i guess but thats not who a dragon shield is for how about on an ironman with any stats you choose but an empty bank
2007scape,not_removed,it really romeo and juliet ernest the chicken goblin diplomacy boom theres i think to go couple of quests you can finish without even leaving the room add those in and youre at in minutes to go thats just off the top of my head to itd probably be closer to an hr hour and a half but its still a much closer guess than hours
2007scape,not_removed,yeah same here i mainly just joking
2007scape,not_removed,so basically you dont have an answer to my question its an illogical change to the core of the game driven by antibotting paranoia of this sub leave the game alone and let the jmods worry about the bots
2007scape,not_removed,duh i was just answering the question
2007scape,not_removed,im voting yes to this stupid poll why are you turning questions back to me cant think of a legitament one
2007scape,not_removed,those quests have been around the entire game the hacks werent made in a day
2007scape,not_removed,i dont really care stopping bots is worth it and its a requirement that makes sense for people to learn
2007scape,not_removed,yes but quests bots will be much mode detectable simply be dint of their nature if you set a large number of bots do all do certain quests in certain ways and they all do it according the script that is detectable
2007scape,not_removed,and quest scripts are something are much easier to detect when you have dozens of accounts following the exact same script and you need to remember that their are a large number of quests you will be required to complete this update will make the detection of all green dragon bots shoot up because they will all be forced to adopt a large number of predictable bottling quest scrips
2007scape,not_removed,and this is a large number of requirements added that they have to bot requirements that are very complex this is more detectable than green dragon bots simply because it is additive to their original botting
2007scape,not_removed,maybe because ur slowing down legit players and pissing them off too
2007scape,not_removed,tell us pls
2007scape,not_removed,do you sincerely believe that is how the bot detection works i wish i knew how the bot detection worked but i dont because it doesnt
2007scape,not_removed,lol they arent going to ban accounts that just happen to click on the same spot whole doing to the same quest the bot detection works when doing repetitive shit because it sees the person does the same thing in perfect time each and every time and clicks the same pixel each time where as on a quest itll click in the same area only a few times and then keep moving on
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,an insignificant amount its like closing an unlocked door between two rooms to slow down ppl walking one person will open it create script and now the door is open and anyone can freely walk through it the action of opening the door itself also took minimal time
2007scape,not_removed,it feels like an eternity at least
2007scape,not_removed,it is also the bis magic defence shield pretty useful when fighting a magic pure
2007scape,not_removed,teleport tabs
2007scape,not_removed,teletabs on you fucking pussy lel
2007scape,not_removed,never go full retard
2007scape,not_removed,in what way was i bitching please inform me
2007scape,not_removed,one game takes skill and the other is a clickfest
2007scape,not_removed,you dont need a maxed account with you could do it with a guy with basic combat stats and like even an ironman especially if you dont need to finish dragon slayer just start it
2007scape,not_removed,youd be surprised what bots were made in a few hours let alone a day
2007scape,not_removed,others care thats why there is a poll and thats why it failed
2007scape,not_removed,where did you get your degree in bot detection exactly
2007scape,not_removed,and quest scripts are something are much easier to detect when you have dozens of accounts following the exact same script we have dozens of accounts killing green dragons in every single world all using one out of a handful of available scripts they do one action wear the exact same gear have level in just about every noncombat stat have unintelligible names and never log out it doesnt get much easier to detect than this and yet here we are thinking of ways to get rid of them or at least slow them down in a meaningful way the bot detection doesnt do anything at all except detect shitty leaked scripts it sure as shit isnt going to ding people for doing something as innocuous as questing
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt true and isnt how most bots work these days
2007scape,not_removed,all legit players have mate
2007scape,not_removed,and then the next bot running the same script will do the exact same thing and on and on it shouldnt be hard to detect at all
2007scape,not_removed,httpstwittercomjagexweath ultimateklaxon find a way around it this message was created by a bot
2007scape,not_removed,oh i didnt realize that youre an idiot carry on
2007scape,not_removed,doing quests is one of the lest tedious things in this game
2007scape,not_removed,now we wait to see if he will admit he is the idiot
2007scape,not_removed,also not everyone likes quest and everyone isnt as effiecient at doing them either using world records as examples for normal people is retarded
2007scape,not_removed,ok make that video then but have no quest items in bank at start of vid and if you use an alt for arrav the account creation time counts too edit and i would point out that you said do all quests in hours not start dragonslayer in hours so the bet would be for all quests done in hours and lets let you do on normal account so you can buy stuff on ge since i dont think youd have a prayer doing that with ironman
2007scape,not_removed,it already failed people need to just let it go
2007scape,not_removed,according to who
2007scape,not_removed,botters care whos to say they didnt bot the poll and make it biased
2007scape,not_removed,if a large number of accounts all do a large number of quests in the exact same way click for click there is no doubt in my mind that is something jagex can detect your sarcasm is unwelcome
2007scape,not_removed,the bot detection doesnt do anything at all except detect shitty leaked scripts it sure as shit isnt going to ding people for doing something as innocuous as questing you have no idea what you are talking about green dragon bots are just that they are simple they are easy randomize because you only need to do actions ever attack green dragons eat good when hp goes below certain number pick up these items teleport when inventory is full teleport when attacked by pkers thats it questing bots are much more complex and much harder to randomize and these bots will have to use a large number of questing bots now
2007scape,not_removed,there are some bots im sure that randomize timing on things but i highly doubt they randomize clicking on things even then that would require painstaking labor and i highly doubt anyone had done that for all quests if i am proven wrong i will be the first to admit it
2007scape,not_removed,thats great and all but can you show us your proof edit here ya go s didnt think it was needed but well we are in the osrs subreddit
2007scape,not_removed,many pking accounts do not
2007scape,not_removed,k and then someone who isnt a bot happens to click and do things in the same order and gets banned thats not how bots get detected
2007scape,not_removed,as someone with a quest cape thats not true for the quests id prefer to click some trees for an hour than slowly waddle my way around the map with agility
2007scape,not_removed,quests are terrible and running around without stamina pots and teleports makes it especially shitty the majority of quests are just generic mmo fetch questskill big bad guy
2007scape,not_removed,im an idiot
2007scape,not_removed,can confirm any quest other then combat based ones that are difficult are torturous especially the longer ones read shit like one small favour
2007scape,not_removed,alright i dont have very much time to do it now but ill do it as soon as possible so what are the specific requirements youre looking for like what am i allowednot allowed to do
2007scape,not_removed,while all those were obviously not made in a day we automated getting qp in less than a day to try out a method so the scripts will defiantly be made that being said quest scripts that are public have a notoriously high ban rate so this update will probably not slow down the creation of accounts but it will increase the ban rate
2007scape,not_removed,botters also voted on the ge which passed by about the bias there didnt seem to matter now did it should we remove that too its the single biggest bothelping thing in the game
2007scape,not_removed,except that it isnt sarcasm youre speaking to something you have absolutely no experience in lmao
2007scape,not_removed,areare you serious
2007scape,not_removed,what would you estimate the chance is that an actual legit player happens to click on the exact same pixel at every point in multiple quests as an existing script
2007scape,not_removed,any stats you want at start or less in bank and no quest items any alt account can be used but time for creating that alt counts in hours normal account so you can buy off ge but buy time counts too must finish all quests in hours honestly i would love to see someone do this i see people say stuff like this all the time but i find it hard to believe it can be done
2007scape,not_removed,if you look at vote numbers you will see a massively higher number of votes on this then on regular issues this will directly hurt botters and you know it all botters would vote it down this is pretty much a fact
2007scape,not_removed,except that it isnt sarcasm youre speaking to something you have absolutely no experience in lmao ive taken several programming classes and i understand the gist a lot of these scripts work by it would not be hard at all to detect accounts that managed to finish quests with identical clicks to each other and do you have a degree in bot scripting you see to be telling me how i am wrong how would you know that do you write code that is used to bot
2007scape,not_removed,didnt think id need a sarcasm tag but ill put one up for this subreddit
2007scape,not_removed,eh im not sure i could do dragon slayer included in that hours but i think i could start it by the end of
2007scape,not_removed,it just barely got more votes than the abbysal dagger question the total vote difference was less than what this poll failed by controversial questions are obviously going to get more votes that argument has been shut down in every thread its been posted in and you didnt answer the my question if you are going sabotage the game for a small impact on bots why not remove the ge it will have a much larger effect and the poll only passed because of the bots voted for it
2007scape,not_removed,ge poll werent botted ge was voted on by all players and passed dont be an idiot just because you dont think it will have a noticeable impact on bots means nothing to me
2007scape,not_removed,what makes you think this one was botted but the ge which is the single best thing to ever happen to bots wasnt there were bots set up in lumbridge at the time spamming in the chat to vote yes for it for fucks sake
2007scape,not_removed,jagex said the ge poll wasnt botted or any of the previous polls but are unsure about this one there were bots set up in lumbridge at the time spamming in the chat to vote yes for it for fucks sake stop defending bots you know what the difference is almost every bot account in the game is bound to have been set up to bot vote this poll im not interested in having you spam me and have blocked you
2007scape,not_removed,i clearly dont know what the difference is why is bots supporting the ge vote different to bots supporting this one because removing the ge would effect you personally sabotaging perfectly fine parts of the game for a negligible impact on bots is retarded
2007scape,not_removed,no nostalgia for this game boy do i envy you id kill to go back years and reexperience this game for the first time if you dont have any nostalgia now play the game enjoy it and have fun
2007scape,not_removed,its completely different from wow mechanicswise but addictive for a lot of the same reasons ive always found wow to be more combatfocused and runescape more moneyfocused
2007scape,not_removed,id say anything thats free is worth trying out you could have made an account in the time it took you to write this post
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont like games that are grindy as hell then no probably not to be totally honest with you give it a try though
2007scape,not_removed,play the game without efficiency guides and youll have a blast once people start getting caught up in best experience rates and most damage in combat per second it can feel stale
2007scape,not_removed,runescape is so addictive because its probably the closest you can get to a sandbox mmo there really isnt many restrictions on how you play this game there isnt a linear path of progression like in wow which is also why i hate wow you can build your account however you like maxing this game out will take roughly days playtime then true game mastery comes at around days playtime so there is an insane amount to do pvm is a big thing in this game if you want to make your money from killing monsters and bosses you can very easily do that here skilling is a less popular option of runescape but the community of skillers are pretty diehard and loyal skilling usually makes for great money making and also gives you a more diverse account that is much more self sufficient pvp is insane in this game especially tribridding i whole heartedly believe that runescape pking requires a much higher skill level than wow pking there is a massive community of pkers and it can be very profitable too if you just enjoy fighting you can use welfare gear so that death isnt too punishing or you can high risk fight with expensive and top tier items with other players for a high risk high reward scenario there are entire account builds dedicated to being a better pker my personal favorite build is a zerker zerker are a great balance between a great fighter that can hold its own against both pures and mains and you can also do pretty good in the pvm environment with them gold oh the gold there will always be an item on your list of wanted items and gold will usually always be able to buy it since nearly everything of value in this game can be traded the acquisition of coins in this game is so addicting especially as your bank gets fatter and fatter runescape quests are the best quests they actually have story meaning and diversity wow is horrible in this regard kill skeletons and receive an exp reward runescape quests also have a lot of tacky cheeseball effect to them some players despise quests because of this then others absolutely love them because of it ultimately runescape is a game you never truly quit you just take extended breaks there is a good reason that after years there is still a huge population on this game the game offers a great deal for every player and does a good job at compensating for their particular play style just remember that the end game goal is to exp waste by bank standing all day d also check this video out this showcases some of the immense skill that exists within the pvp community httpsmyoutubecomwatchvhksigcgsewefeatureyoutube
2007scape,not_removed,its a different kind of game its the kind of game you can play as a casual and then still experience true end game unlike wow
2007scape,not_removed,yes if you loved u can definitely love this game
2007scape,not_removed,give it a try members is a lot more fun than free to play by the way
2007scape,not_removed,i played runescape when i was a young lad pre after that i played wow on and off till feb ive now quit wow altogether and only play osrs i was more of lvler and collector on wow so osrs fits better ive never cared about graphics
2007scape,not_removed,play it asap
2007scape,not_removed,if you like quests in wow youll love quests in runescape
2007scape,not_removed,this game literally has unlimited amount of content so yeah just when you think youre about to achieve something there more things to achieve
2007scape,not_removed,more likely than not people are going to downvote me for saying this but if youre a wow player youll probably adapt to runescape better if action bar combat is more your thing anyway no this isnt a snarky joke about being like wow i like both games osrs is a great game but i find oftentimes that people who have never played runescape back in the golden age dont have the same appreciation for osrs as the people who did whereas people who have no knowledge of the game whatsoever found to be more enjoyable and less grindy my advice if you decide to play play to have fun people get caught up in trying to be as efficient as possible and are only concerned with getting their levels high take the game slow and enjoy all it has to offer
2007scape,not_removed,money focused could you elaborate a bit more
2007scape,not_removed,thats not a good attribute for drugs
2007scape,not_removed,the thing is people only start doing that when theyre hooked on the game which means they think the game is good enough to try to enjoy the maximum amount they can from it which is thru max xp rates
2007scape,not_removed,thank you for all this information man i really appreciate it now i have a much better grasp on what the game is about
2007scape,not_removed,in wow you fight raid bosses for gear that is soul bound in runescape you fight bosses for gold so you can buy gear and invest in skills to help you kill bosses more efficiently most items in runescape arent soul bound fire cape and degraded barrows armorsbarrows gloves are examples of that e if you enjoy raiding and pve in wow id wait to see how raids in osrs are they launch on the worst case scenario grind some stats while you play wow and if its good youll have a head start
2007scape,not_removed,hes joking maxing an account takes roughly hours which translates to days
2007scape,not_removed,however if youd like to play an itemfocused version of rs you simply play as an ironman i think and oldschool wow player would prefer that honestly
2007scape,not_removed,i probably shouldnt of said days playtime and rather just days maxing all skills takes hours but true maxing in terms of complitionist takes quite a bit longer and your looking at a lot of days to complete this plus no one is capable of playing hours strait
2007scape,not_removed,even so your numbers are very far off lol
2007scape,not_removed,cute but the dragon sword has much better stats and a dual function special attack so nah
2007scape,not_removed,i think op is making a joke at the fact that bots use this to kill green dragons since it doesnt have any quest requirements
2007scape,not_removed,oh woosh
2007scape,not_removed,you cant atk players with trident i thought or is that only the normal one edit realized they dont use the staff itself to pk but for the bonus im an idiot
2007scape,not_removed,because they can mate
2007scape,not_removed,toxic trident has magic attack its so far above the bonus of other staves for cheap
2007scape,not_removed,its really good for tbinglow attack pures mage bonus and no attack requiremet a master wand has mage attack bonus and costs times more
2007scape,not_removed,at least you can admit it unlike the majority of other users in his sub d
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,xp required required support
2007scape,not_removed,legit
2007scape,not_removed,tbh i quite agree
2007scape,not_removed,its not smoking a joint
2007scape,not_removed,i can comprehend about of this post but i agree with what i comprehend
2007scape,not_removed,ahh i remember when jagex said they were releasing dragon plate and they released that spinning plate that diango sold same with the kite lmao
2007scape,not_removed,well kite seems a tad basic for a full dragon item and i really hope the dragon platebody has sleeves this time you know like a platebody the throwing axes and sword look about right though
2007scape,not_removed,so were throwing dragon battleaxes now ha
2007scape,not_removed,fuck yes someone speaks sense but no get ready for some motherfucking polygons up this bitch so its gonna look outta place af fam its totally not obvious which items were made fresh in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,raids arnt one creature
2007scape,not_removed,i miss tds gorillas just arent the same
2007scape,not_removed,i miss tds i only killed them toward the end of the preeoc era but they were a blast
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,gorillas aint random
2007scape,not_removed,now we just wait for the horses
2007scape,not_removed,lmak
2007scape,not_removed,yeah honestly i love the plate and everything else looks fine but the kite does not
2007scape,not_removed,the dragon platebody wasnt bad but it is silly how a platebody doesnt have arms like a chainbody personally id like to see it based on the original dragon platebody concept that was leaked way back on the wiki it is the first image in the gallery it looks pretty much the same as the release version but a tad different i think in how the shoulders are
2007scape,not_removed,try the cc deliveritems
2007scape,not_removed,pvp community is mainly cancer thats why its declining
2007scape,not_removed,has anything ever been done about confirmed ddosers either on osrs or pre eoc i can honestly say i dont recall it
2007scape,not_removed,are you seriously uploading a video with a watermark in
2007scape,not_removed,wish a mod could respond to this
2007scape,not_removed,what does halfing halfed mean as used here im not a pker and a lot of the slang eluded me
2007scape,not_removed,thats the only reason puremulti pvp is still somewhat enjoyable very few ddoses happen cause no ones in any substantial risk its just singles main teams that do the majority of this shit
2007scape,not_removed,the person that uploaded this isnt the person in the vid p sure
2007scape,not_removed,as a pvper sadly it is so many ethugs who think they are sooo hard because they can ddos or in max gear at level wildy xd
2007scape,not_removed,its when youre been teleblocked on mage pray and the tb only lasts half as long
2007scape,not_removed,pure clans deal with ddosing of teamspeak not individuals its a different problem but still ends with similar results
2007scape,not_removed,teamspeak and callers
2007scape,not_removed,yeah more clans need to get on discord is literal garbage
2007scape,not_removed,agility is such a pain in the ass
2007scape,not_removed,id upvote if this was the title
2007scape,not_removed,do as many quests with bosses as you can while remaining a zerker turn off all of the bosses that are an absolute pain to kill dag mother chromozon agrithnaar etc put the rest of the bosses on desert treasure dream mentor and rfd bosses are really important if zerkers can have them bring range and melee gear and use prayer to save up on points should take you hours with those stats
2007scape,not_removed,thank you very much for the detailed reply i have all of rfd done as well as lunars just not dream mentor is there a place i could find a list of the pain bosses
2007scape,not_removed,here is a detailed image of defence bonuses leave out witchs experiment if youre afking for more than minutes actually just leave it out anyway it is shit points elvarg treus dayth dag mother agrithnaar if you are afking tanglefoot dad arrg and ice troll king if ranging otherwise theyre ok tbh i leave out rfd because of gelatinnoth mother but its up to you giant roc chronozon giant scarab barrelchest
2007scape,not_removed,if u dont have dream mentor dont do dtrfd
2007scape,not_removed,thank you very much
2007scape,not_removed,why i wear a duel ring when rcing
2007scape,not_removed,when youre glories out of teles you have no duel rings no games neck no skills neck left on home tele left on your minigame tele no tabs and no gun
2007scape,not_removed,just home tele
2007scape,not_removed,the most first world problem ive ever experienced over times
2007scape,not_removed,best start picking them bananas
2007scape,not_removed,tzaar city bank
2007scape,not_removed,you have no idea how funny it is fishing at the dock and seeing someone tele there every using the last charge d karamja only
2007scape,not_removed,take a ring of dueling
2007scape,not_removed,you can collect bananas for gp you can thieve the man on the eastern dock times youre hardly stranded xx bank in tzhaar caves
2007scape,not_removed,just did this earlier lmao
2007scape,not_removed,just use lodestone to prif xd
2007scape,not_removed,dis why you wear a ring of duelling in case p
2007scape,not_removed,lel get packing bananas
2007scape,not_removed,then you have to draw the circle of shame
2007scape,not_removed,when you tele to karamja and your glory is out of charges see what i did there
2007scape,not_removed,its the banana life for you now matey
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,thats where the ring of dueling comes in clutch
2007scape,not_removed,minigame tele to pestcontrol its right near bank
2007scape,not_removed,minigame tele to pest control happens errdaybbro
2007scape,not_removed,why are you wearing full graceful while abyss runecrafting
2007scape,not_removed,because none of us have access to free teleports
2007scape,not_removed,was a problem before home teleports were added
2007scape,not_removed,same
2007scape,not_removed,one of these is not like the other
2007scape,not_removed,put bananas in the crate on the plantation for money for the boat fare back or if you have access to shilo village run down and bank there
2007scape,not_removed,thats when you walk slightly west go down the rope into the volcano and accidentally hang yourself
2007scape,not_removed,at that point logging out sounds like a good idea
2007scape,not_removed,and no rope
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt work if on lunars and u dont have a house at relleka minigame teleport would be an option if not used recently
2007scape,not_removed,xd gtfo with that xd and go back to easyscape this comment is a joke please proceed with caution
2007scape,not_removed,or walk to tzharr bank
2007scape,not_removed,graceful is nontradeable abyss isnt past wildy
2007scape,not_removed,why would you not
2007scape,not_removed,nobody pks rcers
2007scape,not_removed,same
2007scape,not_removed,the volcano is right fucking there people
2007scape,not_removed,or tzhaar
2007scape,not_removed,fuck that ill wait minutes
2007scape,not_removed,dream mentor quest
2007scape,not_removed,teleport tablets
2007scape,not_removed,im still triggered
2007scape,not_removed,the walk of shame
2007scape,not_removed,it happens more often than you might think its best to wear a black dhide top graceful legs and boots of lightness your weight is still less than zero you have more defense and you lose less when you die
2007scape,not_removed,it only takes like minutes tops and is super easy
2007scape,not_removed,you can get your graceful back
2007scape,not_removed,full graceful is more beneficial overall with a decent defence level graceful effect is constant whereas wearing dhide only protects you if youre not paying attention
2007scape,not_removed,graceful recharges ur energy faster when u stand still so it saves a bit on the stamina costs
2007scape,not_removed,protects you from abyss creatures too
2007scape,not_removed,sell and is around gppoint otherwise i just skimmed the list but it seems everything is about points gp
2007scape,not_removed,awesome thank you
2007scape,not_removed,no problem
2007scape,not_removed,requires friends nice burn tc
2007scape,not_removed,strenghtdragon attack
2007scape,not_removed,i did because i wanted to get on the defender grind asap i know thats relatively common
2007scape,not_removed,bro just get it doesnt take that long
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,damn really nmzing it up youre gonna want high construction for restoration pools teleports and the fairy ring hunter is needed for a couple quests including but otherwise not mandatory or anything
2007scape,not_removed,hunter is just for money it has no real gain but its good money when you can catch chins but its painfully slow from lvl but you can do quests to get out of that level range construction is extremely expensive its about per exp but its useful at high levels by being able to place teleports to any location within there
2007scape,not_removed,if your fine how you get around teles and such wherehow you pray change spell books restore stats w pools and you dont have a bank filled with non essentials and just dont care about having something to design yourself than dont bother but it does do a pretty good job of putting a lot of things youll need for various skills in place plus access to servants that can automate some tasks hunter is actually of the few skills that are pretty fun to level up in your you can rock the spottier capeand are requirements for a few of the achievement diaries thats not really important tho also puro puro minigame to catch implings actually not bad but you already have the slayer so stick with that i think hunter is more creative though
2007scape,not_removed,i would wait until planks start to drop
2007scape,not_removed,context i quit back in before jagex came out with summoning so i have no idea how to start construction or hunter or even what theyre used for ive been having a pretty good time just doing my old routine of collecting dragon bones doing barrow runs and clues also i dont know how to pvm the strongest thing ive ever killed was a black dragon the other day and ive never even been to the god wars dungeon
2007scape,not_removed,level up that slayer
2007scape,not_removed,a lot of diaries have a construction requirement i think morytania hard is one of them if you do morytania hard diaries you get more runes per barrows run so thatd be a good reason to work on it you can find out more here
2007scape,not_removed,u need it for some quests hunter is a bit fun too and u get ur own home with construction
2007scape,not_removed,hell yeah man thanks for the feedback everyone
2007scape,not_removed,chins you say will look into it
2007scape,not_removed,for what reason would planks drop
2007scape,not_removed,on it
2007scape,not_removed,gotcha thnx
2007scape,not_removed,hunter is also needed for elite void if you wanna get it
2007scape,not_removed,the prices have gone up a lot in the past week or so so id imagine they will come back down at some point i could be wrong though
2007scape,not_removed,httpiimgurcomfmeimqipng agreed
2007scape,not_removed,been there done that gl on the rebuild man
2007scape,not_removed,nothing
2007scape,not_removed,explodes when you try to use it killing you thus lowering your stats again
2007scape,not_removed,o ok lol
2007scape,not_removed,early days for sure
2007scape,not_removed,interesting era distribution i would have separated classic from early anyway early days or early would be my favorite id also say that could count for early as well those years were around the time i started and they had a lot of really revolutionary updates that sorta paved the way for the years to come i am sure the same can be said about the earlier years and somewhat for the later years as well but a lot of what we know today started around then
2007scape,not_removed,defo pre eoc when chaotics curses and extremesoverloads came out them times were really fun
2007scape,not_removed,started in so i have nostalgia for that era also lots of great memories from d claws were cool too
2007scape,not_removed,and if preeoc would of been released instead of osrs the one with the most votes would be i guarantee you that
2007scape,not_removed,bro u cant add an option because half of reddit users lurk here and skew results
2007scape,not_removed,actually at the time most people just wanted the version of the game before the eoc ish
2007scape,not_removed,doubt it
2007scape,not_removed,i posted it on both subreddits im interested in the whole rs communitys opinion its not supposed to be an vs thing im more interested in the amount of people who preferred pre eoc to the current available gamemodes
2007scape,not_removed,i voted btfo with your blind hate you also post on rrunescape to troll occasionally
2007scape,not_removed,same here to be honest the saddest part is that our hours are now completely devalued by mts and super easy training methods yeah sure the game was sort of in a middle state where the exp rates were roughly double of and half of the current game but that was because there was actually decent higher level content i loved minigames like stealing creation loved the higher level combat stuff like curses and chaotics and summoning and i loved dungeoneering yes like most people i started around the era but i liked the advancement of the game up until the eoc minus the squeal wheel and maybe korasis sword my fondest memories was from sking floors with my friends for loads of money and all the hours i wasted playing stealing creation before the eoc broke it
2007scape,not_removed,did you get exp on twitch or post on someones forms
2007scape,not_removed,theres nothing that can be done to get your items back i would recommend changing your account password and updating your security settings on your account and the email that is linked to your account
2007scape,not_removed,somewhere somehow your account was compromised your items are gone forever make sure your computer bios drivers and security updates are all up to date also make sure your antivirus and spyware are up to date as well use malwarebytes or another popular spyware remover and do a full system scan use windows defender or avast to do a full system scan for viruses do not use poopy mcafee you can step it up a notch and do a disk defragmentation and a ccleaner registry and file sweep sometimes viruses like to hide in unused registry files that ccleaner removes disk defragmentation just helps to organize your drive and can sometimes help your virus and spyware software dectect a virus better remove any sketchy programs or stuff that you dont use anymore the less stuff you have that could potentially compromise your system the better change your email recovery email and runescape passwords and make sure each one is unique setup factor phone authentication on all accounts this adds insane amounts of security especially if you have it on all make sure your recovery questions are updated and not something common like what is your pets name or whose your best friend these are easy questions to bait out of people into giving away their recovery questions this will help prevent future account hijacks do sorta random questions like what color is your first car then you could lie and set the answer as pineapple or something just make sure you write it down and put it in a safe place encase you ever actually need it in the future this also prevents you from giving a recovery question away if you ever actually find yourself in a situation where your talking about your first car with somebody if your runescape password is the same or similar to other passwords for anything else that you use that requires a login i would suggest to change all of those passwords to something unique if someone has access to your account and your password is the same on other things like facebook or paypal then they also have access to those
2007scape,not_removed,runescape
2007scape,not_removed,i was on a twitch streamer how ive watched for months and i woneed a drawing for a dragon scimitar but thats it and that was probably a week before this happened other then that nothing else barely text in chat too
2007scape,not_removed,will do thank you so i should download that ccleaner
2007scape,not_removed,for sure its a good program to use on a regular basis not just when your account gets compromised it helps declutter your pc and it will help your pcs performance a decent bit
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,make it so the xp you get from adding logs to a bonfire is multiplied by for each person there is doing it too and ofcourse let us do it with noted logs
2007scape,not_removed,whenever i think about httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkrczbwdembm i have to think about this and laugh my ass off
2007scape,not_removed,no this devalues my firemaking xp and the amount of time i have spent manually clicking between logs and a tinderbox
2007scape,not_removed,bonfires dont give firemaking a use they just make it easier to train thats a pretty big distinction
2007scape,not_removed,go easy guys i wasnt serious
2007scape,not_removed,go and play everything is easy and meaningless you will love it
2007scape,not_removed,why bother just make it so we can use noted logs on a bonfire and they all burn at once and u get all the xp
2007scape,not_removed,dont do stuff you dont enjoy cx
2007scape,not_removed,probs didnt change ur prayer quick enough u might not have moved the healers far enough away from jad
2007scape,not_removed,you were slow on the pray switch try the line method with the healers if you have decent def lure all into line so you only tank and only it can heal jad the other will be stuck trying to attack you but unable
2007scape,not_removed,you dying to jad doesnt mean the fight caves are broken
2007scape,not_removed,maybe youre ping spiked one way or another you were slow on the prayer
2007scape,not_removed,what a nice thing to say to someone whos trying to help you s
2007scape,not_removed,nothings my fault and im probably better than you is how i read this comment such a manchild response
2007scape,not_removed,fortunately theres been no evidence for the entire mechanics of the fight caves being broken in the last years of osrs
2007scape,not_removed,nice one i really like the no flicking aspect
2007scape,not_removed,seems interesting does need some balancing thoughthe high level prayers are broken some of it makes for great tanking
2007scape,not_removed,has some good concepts feel that some require tweeting and some have no real place in the game
2007scape,not_removed,and the winner of the nominees for worst liar is
2007scape,not_removed,why would you redeem bonds that you dont know where came from
2007scape,not_removed,tweet jagexsupport too
2007scape,not_removed,your story doesnt make much sense why would someone get access to your credit card and runescape account and buy bonds then on top of that leave them on your account for you and not take them to top it all off you saw all these bonds you didnt buy and decided it was a good idea to redeem of them
2007scape,not_removed,hillary clinton
2007scape,not_removed,i dont understand what he would be lying about someone got on his account bought bonds probably didnt realize he was an ironman so they couldnt transfer them over
2007scape,not_removed,this lmao op what the hell are you thinking
2007scape,not_removed,someone gained access to his account used their own credit card or stolen credit card bought bonds then requested the money back through their credit card company
2007scape,not_removed,if you had bonds on your account that you didnt know where they came from what would you do just let them sit there bonds only good for one thing on an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,this would be more believable if they didnt leave the bonds on the account for him and actually took them off successfully laundering the stolen money and if he didnt redeem bonds that appeared randomly on his account either way story is full of odd holes
2007scape,not_removed,get in contact with jagex asap
2007scape,not_removed,bonds
2007scape,not_removed,sharkbrewcom to find the pure clan thats right for you
2007scape,not_removed,you can make the account ranged pure a free to play in and then skip tutorial and trade the bond over to it in world on or if its same acc use the bond in and youllreemain member in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,its fun to make your own money on oldschool
2007scape,not_removed,ill buy a bond for old school
2007scape,not_removed,hes trying to sell his bond for oldschool gold
2007scape,not_removed,send this to jagex via emailtweet peeps will prob downvote it on reddit and it wont get the attention it needs
2007scape,not_removed,tipoffjagexcom
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,i really dont get it lol
2007scape,not_removed,how does this lure work
2007scape,not_removed,iirc luring isnt an offense
2007scape,not_removed,hey what was his stream name showkey was one of the aliases that my friend went with before he died id like to know how he knows him
2007scape,not_removed,snitch
2007scape,not_removed,lol who cares its just a lurer
2007scape,not_removed,are you telling me that every time i told someone over a cc that i smashed their mums last night i could have been reported and potentially have my account terminated jmod respond pls
2007scape,not_removed,who cares those people have multiple accounts with different ips anyways youre stopping no one reporting this person
2007scape,not_removed,its called the corporeal beast lure someone tried to pull it on me so i can summarize what they do first the scammer finds a victim to lure by spamming whoever can show me the biggest bank wins at the ge if you show them your bank they will put you on hold for mins and then magically tell you yours was the largest bank they saw then they tell you they are doing a seed pod giveaway and you need to listen to the instructions at this point the scammers altaccount will private message you telling you its a lure but you can antilure them and keep the cash they will tell you to search for a video on youtube called warning this is a fake vid with fake comments which shows a guy doing the antilure the vid is fake as in the real lure the scammer will just cancel the trade so you wont get the money anyway the goal of is to get you excited about antiluring and compliant to do what the scammer asks ok now to the actual lure the scammer tells you to bank all your items gives you a games necklace and tells you to teleport corporeal beast he walks you around a bit to show you the corporeal beast entrance area is safe then he tells you to tele to barbarian assault and grab all the items you showed him earlier now this is the scam part the scammer adds you to his clan chat and tells you to join his private clanonly corporeal beast instance only people in his clan chat are allowed to enter the instance then he convinces you to drop your items on the instance floor which you do since its part of the fake antilure vid shown earlier and tells you to trade him for the cash with the trade window open the scammer puts up the cash and then kicks you from his clan chat since you are no longer in his clan you are no longer allowed in his clanonly corp instance so the server kicks you from the instance with your items still on the instance floor the scammer then picks up your items and calls you an idiot then adds you to his ignore list the last part is a bit confusing so here is a video of what it looks the lurers point of view
2007scape,not_removed,they bring you to an instanced corp cave room and will first try to get you to drop items and click the gnome pod thing that teleports you away if you are clever enough not to take the teleport theyll try to get you to drop your items and then trade them for x cash once you trade theyll notice that you have dropped your items more empty inv space and kick you out of the instanced corp lair
2007scape,not_removed,people are so gullible you would be an idiot if you dropped your items
2007scape,not_removed,ah i see yea just dont ever drop your items and you cant go wrong eh
2007scape,not_removed,its still possible what you do now is get tele grab runes and then drop your god max cape outside the pool jump inside the pool run and pray at one of the altars grab the god cape and use it onto another max cape make sure you have the hood too go back outside the pool and telegrab your max cape you dropped
2007scape,not_removed,it used to be drop telegrab before they changed it i dunno if theres a new way now
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,youre welcome
2007scape,not_removed,crab people
2007scape,not_removed,raids are mainly done with range and mage no one uses prims there they will go back up once raids lose hype and the reward prices drop
2007scape,not_removed,everything that isnt used in raids has dropped most people opt for pegs or eternals for that so demand for prims drops among those who can afford it while players are still killing cerb and bringing more prims into the game tldr supplydemand therefore price drop
2007scape,not_removed,if you look at the amount sold ever since raid the amount sold has gone up by like i think people hoarded them to try and flip during raids now they are dumping them hopefully they will go back up as i have gotten prim crystal from cerb and dont want to sell them for such a low price
2007scape,not_removed,seems like raids had a negative effect on a lot of stuff maybe stuff will start to balance out and the bis boots will return to a stable price
2007scape,not_removed,ah that makes sense i could see them possibly going back up to settle back down because they are bis but could be wrong
2007scape,not_removed,they will most likely go back up people like me will bring prices up stopped raiding bought primsbandos back
2007scape,not_removed,they prob will settle around within the next i think
2007scape,not_removed,because you can stay at gwdbosses even longer than you already can
2007scape,not_removed,summoning is a combat stat the familiars fight with you etc increasing the combat level to i imagine that is another big reason why it wouldnt get a popular vote if they removed the combatbeast of burden abilities its basically a skill to make your own pets petscape would be devalued at that point
2007scape,not_removed,with the introduction of summoning youll devalue several items beast of burden allow you to carry supplies and more drops skilling beasts give an advantage to amount of things harvested per hour devaluing resources even more burdencombat will cause bossing to become much easier and will completely devalue items dropped by them not to mention multiwild will be full of titans that wreck you before you can do anything theres a lot of reasons why not
2007scape,not_removed,id like to do what mod ash suggested and just pick through what was good and bad about summoning until we get something that were satisfied with summoning skill was fundamentally a great update a lot of the familiars are very strong however
2007scape,not_removed,summoning was awesome and id love it in old school even though it couldnt be called old school then
2007scape,not_removed,yak is op as fuck you know it too ive had yak in since like trust me ik how op that sob is banking dragon bones hides armor anything even before eoc hit it was massively op extra slots and the ability to boot
2007scape,not_removed,summoning isnt old school
2007scape,not_removed,bobs were insanely broken i think summoning conceptually would work fine i think that bobs in general cant function and would need to be removed completely
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think its simpley by virtue of it being recycled content i didnt hate summoning in but its not really something im dying to have again summoning changed everything through bob and the fact that your followers could fight with you i also didnt like how essential summoning became you could never join teams or do anything efficiently unless you had at least summ or whatever for tort im not and im sure many others arent looking forward to collecting another crimson charms or whatever the hell it took it jsut seems dumb to me to spend dev time to develop something the majority of the community has already done gwd and corp were huge favorites that were easy to add and fill a huge pvm void that osrs had at the beginning i think that is all the recycled content we need
2007scape,not_removed,im a big believer in updates both small qols and big game changing updates but i dont want them to work a long time on something that has been done before summoning has been in the game before same as dungeoneering stealing creation they would have to work a pretty long time to get the content ready for the engine they use they cant just copy it from before like other stuff they have added atm and it would be purely for nostalgic purpose id rather have them put all that work into something new or something adapted to what they want so it still might be summoning but not the summoning we knew from before
2007scape,not_removed,there are plenty of reasons summoning is not in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,discussion why not summoning discussion why not squeal of fortune isnt getting xp hard enough without having a convenient way to buy it
2007scape,not_removed,why the fuck would anyone want summoning you can already do hour bandos duos summoning would practically make it so you get hour logged before having to leave fuck off with shitty suggestions
2007scape,not_removed,turns game from ez mode to greenhorn
2007scape,not_removed,the biggest reason for me at least idk about everyone else on here i dont want summoning on osrs is because of how much more inventory space you have with say the pack yak it adds an entire inventory of foodpotions to your trip and with of them at a gwd boss you could stay there for days on end without banking it will just make rare drops cost less and make bosses camp fests
2007scape,not_removed,summoning has a lot of factors to it first there is the grind for charms which is both good and bad good because it adds more purpose to certain creatures like waterfiends and prevents the skill from being purely buyable but bad because it creates of lot of grinding before the actual grinding to train the skill spirit shards also had their issues the ingredients varied but for the most part id say those were positive since they gave new use to useless items as for the familiars they were very hit and miss either it was a bob to hold items some form of healing or some passive stat boost or it was generally useless with few exceptions aside from the titans familiars werent that useful for dealing damage the bob and healers had a huge impact on how you could camp monsters which is not a change osrs really needs the skilling familiars were more minor but their stat boosts do affect exp personally id only want to see something like summoning to see how theyd do it differently i remember a while back it came up on a qa that if they did do it it would have revamped charms and spirit shards maybe scrapped and probably no bobs i am also a fan of seeing what an animal lore skill would look like in osrs animal lore was the original concept for summoning and was meant to be the artisan skill to hunter which sounds pretty awesome
2007scape,not_removed,id love to see summoning come to osrs
2007scape,not_removed,it created a large shift in gameplay meta which at the time i enjoyed but do not want to play through again on osrs
2007scape,not_removed,pack yak will allow more godswords into the game with longer trip capabilities do you really want ags to be
2007scape,not_removed,that makes no sense cause summoning will be introducing a new mechanic to the game staying at bosses for longer shouldnt be a game changer
2007scape,not_removed,looks a lot better than and the combatbeast of burden abilities is what summoning is about lol
2007scape,not_removed,like zulrah corp master clues zeah etc
2007scape,not_removed,that argument is pretty bad since tons of osrs content isnt old school
2007scape,not_removed,worst possible argument lol
2007scape,not_removed,see you guys have no reason for saying no but you still do cause its just stuff
2007scape,not_removed,discussion
2007scape,not_removed,when you pour your sexual frustration onto reddit
2007scape,not_removed,what lol how does that not change the game lol
2007scape,not_removed,you understand a lot of the people that play this version are very anticombat changes the mods cant even talk about releasing new weapons or armor without an outrage of some sort just saying
2007scape,not_removed,summoning is a skill that has been done before why do you want to add something that has been done before the content you listed are new to an extent and have been designed for osrs i imagine a large majority would want a newly designed skill
2007scape,not_removed,how about you give a reason why we want summoning its gamechanging op crap i like osrs the way it is screw adding a new skill that makes literally every part of the game easier
2007scape,not_removed,because its terrible is a good reason
2007scape,not_removed,what he said is so true imagine maxed players with bis even ellys with yaks they could farm gwd a lot of items keep theyre value because ppl are to lazy to bank them also i dont want to see a crash in armor weapons etc because of summoning the game is better off wo
2007scape,not_removed,because when they were doing new skills in they had a much bigger development team therefore content might be higher quality and more thoughtout they also have a finished base they can start working off because with their small team stuff takes ages to be done and hell percent of the oldschool content was there in so it isnt new content in anyway and still people love it and the most recent poll showed us the large majority of people voting in that poll are down for skills like dungeoneering and summoning
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for this mate i use a linux distro on my chrome book and this is gonna help for when im at school
2007scape,not_removed,thanks i was about to dual boot linux and this is gonna be helpful for scaping
2007scape,not_removed,heres a simple script i made to toggle my hotkeys anyone that finds this thread can use it my distro has keyboard shortcuts independent of xbindkeys so i mapped the script to a key to toggle my rs hotkeys just throw it in a text file name it anythingsh and make it executable if pgrep xbindkeys devnull then pkill f xbindkeys else xbindkeys fi
2007scape,not_removed,thank you for this i may try this instead
2007scape,not_removed,just suicide on them oh wait
2007scape,not_removed,mode is dying soon anyways who gives a fuck
2007scape,not_removed,exactly everyone is happy af that you cant suicide in guardeds meanwhile guardeds are a mulefest now
2007scape,not_removed,this has buuullshit written all over it
2007scape,not_removed,we both know thats bullshit mate
2007scape,not_removed,go to ge and buy yourself a crude chair and some rope
2007scape,not_removed,im not saying osbuddy might have caused it but i run osbuddy pros constantly over the last year and have never had a ban because of it maybe one of the features i have turned off could do it but idk
2007scape,not_removed,false you botted get over your ban the fact that you would get banned from one account and then bot the other is pretty sad but to make a post about it trashing a client that thousands use on a daily makes it even worse if osbuddy got you banned i would have been banned a long time ago on both my accounts best case scenario you were using ahk which is still bannable
2007scape,not_removed,butbut what bout the noose wand mom
2007scape,not_removed,i was under the impression that osbuddy was told what tools they can have by jagex osrs team whoever deals with that stuff to ensure that osbuddy doesnt give any advantage
2007scape,not_removed,i find it funny how you say i was trashing a client i havent said a bad word about os buddy you fool i was told that os buddy could have been the issue i never said os buddy was bad or anything so dont jump to conclusions and whats ahk oo
2007scape,not_removed,people seem convinced spellbook and prayer rearranging will ruin pvp somehow
2007scape,not_removed,op with hotkeys ppl are bad enough as it is
2007scape,not_removed,im on the spellbook one im all for being able to sort if how you want it could be great for pvp however the last time this was attempted in it completely fucked up the spellbooks for pvp as they changed the dimensions of the spell window by adding buttons and sliders etc which made the default options different to their previous layouts the other options werent exactly great either and the overall result was it was an abysmal mess so while i would want and vote for such an update i dont trust them not to make it worse than it currently is
2007scape,not_removed,its not just about pvp some people just dont want people to be able to skill things to easily and dont want to lose the original feel the game has while you say the people who dont want it wont have to switch its not really true they would feel obligated to for the best xp rates also some people want the j mods working on more important stuff like actual content or fixing things wrong with the game im usually a lurker but all these posts about this stupid poll are making me post stop complaining that you wont be able to super heat without moving your mouse people want what they want in the game and a good fraction of the community didnt want rearrangeable spells
2007scape,not_removed,makes pvp easier and skilling easier for skilling you can position spells like super heat on the last slot and just spam click the same area
2007scape,not_removed,u can just use runeloader for this
2007scape,not_removed,separate poll for prayers and spellbook thoughts on that
2007scape,not_removed,because people voted no
2007scape,not_removed,bitch whine moan the things i want arent passing
2007scape,not_removed,wwwaaaahhhh why dont people want what i want stupid nazis
2007scape,not_removed,didnt vote no but it makes nhinghybridding and pking with prayers easier in general wouldnt ruin pvp but definitely makes it easierless of a skill especially imo edit also a few scenarios with skilling it effects too
2007scape,not_removed,does it devalue your rsi
2007scape,not_removed,hes asking for reasoning lad
2007scape,not_removed,if you think about it all pvp is is rng two top lvl pkers fighting rng is there to ride it out
2007scape,not_removed,you sure about that
2007scape,not_removed,nah theres a lot of skill i can tell you dont pk getting constantly hit without the right prayer will make him out dps try switching prayers gear and eating all at the same time its not easy
2007scape,not_removed,youre correct if the two players are equally skilled which is rarely the case but even when that is the case so what any skill based game or sport will rely on random factors to determine the winner if the two players are equally skilled
2007scape,not_removed,jesus fuck that click accuracy is insane
2007scape,not_removed,yeah take two players of the same exact skill level it all just comes down to rng you diehard neckbeard pkers who think theyre next level are too dumb to argue with
2007scape,not_removed,hes equipping some stuff fast but the rest of it very literally is rng i just really dont think me being able to put superheat closer to the top of my spellbook will help him rng any better
2007scape,not_removed,if you think about it in a way rs is just an entire game of rng anyways a good pker in rs can win consistently because his actions are more precise giving them much higher chance of winning
2007scape,not_removed,youve thought about this so little that you dont even realise superheat has to be at the bottom right of your spellbook to make it require the least mouse movement possible as it stands pking is in a state where top pkers can run average pkers out of food literally of the time and good pures can quite easily drop shitty mains even though the rng is skewed heavily in the opposite favour anything that makes hybridding easier makes it more like edge pking where any random noob can kill a good player with a lucky spec so how about you superheat the slightly more irritating way for an hour and let the entire bridding community have the game they enjoy
2007scape,not_removed,putting all the prays and spells together does help
2007scape,not_removed,you completely ignore the fact that there are ores besides iron and gold which would be more efficient to keep at the top because theres fewer of them with the coal in the inventory and the spellbook only goes to a row above the bottom inventory space but sure i mean its close but close doesnt win prizes but this does demonstrate your lack of understanding of skilling quite well so i thank you im sure youre triggered that pking is more rng than skill and you want to defend that but all the best prayers and spells like piety raids prayers ice barrage veng etc are all already at the bottom near the spec bar aint shit changing for you guys if youre so insecure that you think a couple milliseconds switch difference is going to let random nonpkers dominate you maybe the problem is you because people are simultaneously running this story that pvp is all skill but also that this will turn any old noob into the switch master switching a prayer easier will not help someone who cant already pull off gear switches theres a much bigger bar to being good at pking before a prayer switch even starts to matter you can put augury and ice barrage right on top of each other but it doesnt matter if you cant get in the door to begin with because your game sense and mouse movement are shit so please get over yourselves pking isnt getting ruined if anything this would probably get more easy to kill noobs in the wildy who are incorrectly thinking itd be enough to matter but hey devils advocate lets say youre right and suddenly starts steamrolling everyone with his sick mystic might to fire wave switches what would be the problem with pvp being more competitive and approachable it just further defines whos really good at pking because all the other things matter far more
2007scape,not_removed,you lost me at the first sentence when you mentioned superheating anything other than iron or gold and efficiency in the same sentence iron is bis for magic efficiency at defence without gaining hp exp otherwise lunar spells are simply better exph gpxp and ehp per hour played and gold is bis for smithing xp which i guess would be efficient if you wanted to train magic on a def pure and work towards smithing for wildy elite diaries or just to have a cool on your def pure apart from these niche uses superheat item really has no place in efficient play you can bring up ironmen using superheat for whatever reason but then youd have to ask yourself since the spell is basically useless for regular main accounts unless you have quite a low magic level why make the game easier for ironmen who opted to make the game harder in the first place so my point still stands if you want to fuck around in rs feel free to fuck around and have fun but dont try to get in the way of how other people play the game once you finish superheating from to and move on to more useful training methods like stun alching you wont care anyway
2007scape,not_removed,thank you everybody
2007scape,not_removed,isnt hunter req for nevermind
2007scape,not_removed,range will help quite a bit with
2007scape,not_removed,i got my quest cape a week ago with a little more better stats so just the combat stats in the and range at
2007scape,not_removed,ranged for a blowpipe is great for dream mentor wont be hard with those stats
2007scape,not_removed,get ranged for blowpipe first boss and rcb with rubydiamond bolts last boss
2007scape,not_removed,farming just because it is a good skill to level up
2007scape,not_removed,neither quest is hard you should be fine with those stats
2007scape,not_removed,insert it
2007scape,not_removed,alch tbh
2007scape,not_removed,virus scan now change passwords authenticator add bankpin on a different pc if possible
2007scape,not_removed,there is no way to tell because we dont know how the website is coded that being said to be save change passwords on your accounts add a bank pin and an authenticator
2007scape,not_removed,ok yeah just did also i tried to see what would happen if someone tried to get into my email everything should be secure
2007scape,not_removed,ok thanks
2007scape,not_removed,kurasks dont even need a slayer only area its not that packed lol
2007scape,not_removed,yeah the rest of farming has hardly started to recover from wintertodt and i saved a bunch of limp seeds from slayer hoping to increase my farming yields now its not really worth it and the kurask noted limp drops also lower the value of the drop table of many other slayer monsters
2007scape,not_removed,what about coconuts papayas white berries etc they all crashed like lol
2007scape,not_removed,i totally forgot i would plant limpwurt flowers for money making damn it would be a welcome change to get rid of the random farming items from a slayer monster this is what seeds are for but sadly these are overdropped from many sources as well
2007scape,not_removed,maybe they should make it so you get more per flower limproots evry few hours from farm runs is pretty weak imo
2007scape,not_removed,i have noticed a fuck ton of the items on the new drop table have crashed very sad
2007scape,not_removed,i would have rather seen them add special seeds that tremendously increase the yield of things like limpwurt roots white berries coconuts and papayas instead of the actual material itself fertile limpwurt seed fertile white berry seed etc planting these seeds could result in like yield of the endcrop
2007scape,not_removed,has only just begun to recover from the slayerscape mindset they had zulrah is evidence to suggest that well be going down a similar path in that pvm skilling in every way possible
2007scape,not_removed,i agree when i was saving for a bond i relied on the roots to pay for supplies and such
2007scape,not_removed,limpwurt roots just dont come into the game fast enough i understand the irks for but in all reality was never able to supply a reasonable quantity of secondaries and for farming the patch should honestly just have a farminglevel based chance to roll for a limpwurt clump that can be cut into roots
2007scape,not_removed,i view the addition of highly in demand inconvenient to obtain skilling resources as a welcome and necessary change to the kurask drop table as more and more people reach higher levels and start to go for and the game will need more of these skilling resources for them to burn through prior to this slayer update and deviant specters to some extent limp roots were trickling into the game due to very limited sources where they could be obtained white berries were even worse with almost all of the white berries in the game coming from white berry bots in the wild people are often quick to point to adding these to the kurask drop table as a short sighted move by the osrs team but i counter that it was a calculated move designed to do exactly what it did drive the price of secondaries and tree run supplies down
2007scape,not_removed,i understand from jagexs point of view that slayer monsters drop needed a buff lets be honest many of them had drops that are utter shit but i feel like they dont consider the farming of those monsters like if slayer monsters were basically restricted to slayer tasks only i feel like it would have been the best route to buff them how they did you could extend tasks for points perm or extend for a small fee or block wyverns should have taught them that now its just wyvernsl and gargoyle alts it just seems silly but with that being said i dont see a problem with a lot of the drops gargoyles dropping cash is dumb but its resource drops for bars is kind of neat i dont like alchable drop tables i like drop tables that encourage skilling alongside killing
2007scape,not_removed,no pls ironman
2007scape,not_removed,im all for nerfing drops but at this point im not so sure when wintertodt came out i was kind of bummed out because my slayer level isnt great and a snap dragon or rannar seed used to get me excited now they have dropped quite a bit but people said that seeds shouldnt have cost that much anyways so idk where i stand on this
2007scape,not_removed,make farming great again
2007scape,not_removed,nerf them and buff farming for limps and whiteberrys
2007scape,not_removed,also make the wyverns nonslayer area multi
2007scape,not_removed,you do understand that the limpwurt root was way overpriced and its getting a more stable and reasonable price now
2007scape,not_removed,man i asked ash this on twitter and he wont even acknowledge it as a problem he was a real dick to me by saying just because you want something in the game doesnt make it priority if something is clearly broken what the fuck fix it
2007scape,not_removed,because all their buffed loots crashed in value lol
2007scape,not_removed,true the one that comes to mind is deviant specs
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i know its a shame i dont like when monster drops devalue resources that can be obtained by skilling i focused on limpwurts because i really do think its unfair to people and also it was a fairly common thing to add on to herb runs for extra profit
2007scape,not_removed,one of the worst updates in recent history i dont understand why they thought its a good way to fix their drop table this is so stupid
2007scape,not_removed,limps only have a minute growth timer doesnt mean you should bother doing them outside herb runs though
2007scape,not_removed,getting more from farming would just bring more into the game making the problem even worse
2007scape,not_removed,when something is op you nerf it not buff everything else this design philosophy is fucking retarded and its whats gonna kill osrs
2007scape,not_removed,always what happens when they update or release new monsters rarely has the osrs team released something with underwhelming drops theyve always overdone it then had to nerf it after seeing how badly they missed the mark zulrah wintertodt etc
2007scape,not_removed,lol there is no such thing as overpriced only supply and demand which forms reasonable price at any given moment
2007scape,not_removed,when i first brought the wintertodt drop tables prenerf to ashs attention he had the nerve to tell me seed crashes had little to do with wintertodt being released they really have no clue how to run this game you all can hate me all you want but i lose more and more faith in the osrs team every day
2007scape,not_removed,deez nuts crash down the sperm on ur mothers face
2007scape,not_removed,jagex should stop buffing monster drop tables by giving them tons of resource drops became awful partly because of the gradual devaluation of skilling combat and resourcegathering should walk sidebyside not one in front of the other
2007scape,not_removed,kurasks definitely needed a drop table buff they were just extremely heavy handed with it nechs gargs and scarabites did not i have no idea why they were even polled but of course when somebody reads a poll that says vote yes and you will make more money of course it is going to pass
2007scape,not_removed,this is how jagex fixes drop tables people complain for weeks jagex makes every slayer monster and then resource price drop hard the only balanced drop tables in the last years have been sire and cerberus but they seem to ignore that and would rather put ranarrs snaps magic seeds torstals as uncommon drops from fucking wintertodt until those dropped in price
2007scape,not_removed,so herbs are on a timer iirc and you get an average of per harvest
2007scape,not_removed,i dont disagree i just think it should make sense to collect them from farming maybe a nerf drops and buff farming fix would make more sense
2007scape,not_removed,i generaly agree but its not black and white and some times it makes more sense to buff rather then nerf i said what i said because if you were trying to collect limps with only farming getting only at a time from running around between spred apart farming patches seems really underwelming to me i think they should nerf kurask and necheral limp drops a little and buff the farming at the same time ps throwing terms like fucking retarded doesnt help anyone have a constructive discussion
2007scape,not_removed,one of the biggest reasons i vote no to almost every suggestion of new content i really have no faith in jagex to balance it
2007scape,not_removed,sire and cerb were done pretty good drops generally cover costs at least and if you get a rare then bank was made
2007scape,not_removed,that exact statement can be made about it now
2007scape,not_removed,i was too until i saw you commented on youre own comment
2007scape,not_removed,maybe it is time for you to stop caring so much and let the mods get on with it there is no problem with seeds and limps being cheaper how is anything clearly broken
2007scape,not_removed,if they dont have a clue how to run the game and youre losing faith in the team why do you still play it
2007scape,not_removed,lolwat
2007scape,not_removed,jagex has been heavy handed with every drop table buff ever
2007scape,not_removed,minute and average yield is just under
2007scape,not_removed,a better argument is it kills a fair bit of farming content where it wasnt necessary it is the highest level flower to plant and disincentivizes that patch overall
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i disagree the abby demon dark beast and spiritual mage drop table updates were done well in my opinion
2007scape,not_removed,the average yield is with super compost and magic secateurs no reason not to use those
2007scape,not_removed,example more methods for gouttuber for karamja med price crash because more supply for it gouttuber is very high priced overpriced imo according to there is no such thing as overpriced
2007scape,not_removed,that is a flaw with farming though
2007scape,not_removed,you dont do that
2007scape,not_removed,no thats a pretty bad comparison tbh you can choose what game you play but not the country youre born after so many years you can decide but most of the time its a gruelling process at best
2007scape,not_removed,yeah if you dont have faith in your country you should move i do believe that
2007scape,not_removed,and those are and slayer respectively gargoyles and kurasks shouldnt be as good as spiritual mages just because people didnt like doing kurask tasks
2007scape,not_removed,is this the one or is there an one i have not heard of if its then it probably was done well because if it were op id know about it
2007scape,not_removed,maybe if you assume they all dont die with death included you average just over
2007scape,not_removed,its fairly priced imo it can take all day to get one or you could spend hours doing a more enjoyable activity and buy one
2007scape,not_removed,while this is true the drop table still contributes to the problem adding new plants is a massive undertaking when compared to simply altering a drop table the burden should be on the simpler one which caused the problem
2007scape,not_removed,dont be a twat
2007scape,not_removed,the problem was that kurasks were not only bad gphr with their poor drop table but also abysmal xphr since you were forced to either range them or use much lower tiered weapons like i said i supported the kurask drop table update but they were very heavy handed with it
2007scape,not_removed,yeah all in osrs
2007scape,not_removed,this from the wiki herbs yield an average of leaves per plot with optimum tools
2007scape,not_removed,im basing my number on the small arms video where he got ranarrs from seeds so id say per seed is a good guess
2007scape,not_removed,most people do not see it as a problem though i certainly dont i know a farming overhaul would be a big project having you get more flowers at higher levels would be a good way to change it
2007scape,not_removed,how is he being a twat you really dont do that because you can just put it all in one post
2007scape,not_removed,he is also farming and using revive
2007scape,not_removed,then why did you say instead of he used crop revive whenever died which removes half of the deaths this will not be the case for most herb farmers as it isnt worth the rune cost unless you are growing ranarrs or snapdragons
2007scape,not_removed,and the post i initially replied to assumed no deaths for limpwurts
2007scape,not_removed,the post i initially replied to assumed no deaths for limpwurts either
2007scape,not_removed,where he said limps every few hours that could be assuming of the patches die and you could still get limps every few hours are you ever going to own up to the fact that you fucked up or are you going to continue deflecting
2007scape,not_removed,yeah my bad i forgot everyone does limp runs every minutes
2007scape,not_removed,so continuing to deflect is the answer to my question
2007scape,not_removed,must be easy to argue when you pre assume you are right no matter what someone doesnt agree must be deflecting you think is a random number no its based on patches x yield each therefore assuming no deaths the words every few hours are too vague to be meaningful and in that context can be replaced with every run unless you genuinely believe people do limp runs each minutes rather than simply adding them on top of their herb runs
2007scape,not_removed,you failing to admit you are wrong and pointing out how other people are kind of wrong instead is deflecting you didnt even know how long it took herbs to grow hours ago much less what the average yield was stop being a child
2007scape,not_removed,i admitted in that very post i wasnt aware of the time herbs needed mins afaik which isnt the point anyway thats a nice strawman though getting deperate my average yield guess was closer than yours aaand theres the ad hominem yup clearly youre in the right when you resort to two falacies in three sentences i could say plenty of things about your person but i dont need to do that
2007scape,not_removed,yeah is definitely closer to than slightly above is come on kid you know your comments are public right anybody can come and see how fucking stupid you are why do you keep lying
2007scape,not_removed,comment
2007scape,not_removed,have you tried osbuddy highway feature
2007scape,not_removed,paytoplay is the meta premium vpn is the only fix rn
2007scape,not_removed,game seems fine for me
2007scape,not_removed,reply
2007scape,not_removed,yeah so true and yeah i have tried osbuddy highway but my comp lags decently bad with osbuddy as embarrassing as that is lol
2007scape,not_removed,id recommend a new toaster in that case certainly isnt helping you out
2007scape,not_removed,this makes no logical sense you are chopping the bark of the tree but you are wanting to go inside of the tree that isnt hollow to shop the bark then again it also makes no sense that you chop the bark to get logs it may look hollow but it isnt
2007scape,not_removed,is way too much d
2007scape,not_removed,lol redwoods gl
2007scape,not_removed,people are so desperate to sink items at this point that suggestions dont even make sense
2007scape,not_removed,its an mmorpg its not meant to make sense
2007scape,not_removed,idc how many community can decide
2007scape,not_removed,for juicy stacks of noted dark crabs of course
2007scape,not_removed,ive seen monni getting plenty of kills on the world so sure its worth it to be pking there also high total lvled pkers are guaranteed to go pking there on the world solo or with a smaler team because they know theres guaranteed gonna be people fishing on that world so the question is more why would you be fishing on the world when you know high lvled pkers gonna go pk there every now and then
2007scape,not_removed,not everyone plays for efficiency some play for blood
2007scape,not_removed,oh but the ehp is made up for by hagthaving a good timeph which directly correlates to the psiplayer sanity index
2007scape,not_removed,total concerned about ehp
2007scape,not_removed,he is trying to be funny but he left his humor at home tonight
2007scape,not_removed,it gets big for the first few weeks of each seasonal the next one should be starting in a month people quit because they die and lose most of their progress its not great for casual players
2007scape,not_removed,dmm has cycles next one starts next month itll be all the rage again dont get me wrong dmm is dope as fuck even if i only play for a few days it gets your adrenaline going gets the quality streams going great overall
2007scape,not_removed,i went pking today killed people got shit loot then suicided
2007scape,not_removed,dont play unless you have a team there still is no pj timer in as for seasonals i think they are looking to make month long seasonals where your stats carry over to the tournament if this is the case you can expect to see deadman seasonals not dying out as fast
2007scape,not_removed,im a deadman mode content creater world check out my videos if you want to see how regular dmm is like the community is small so you get to know everyone and its quite active
2007scape,not_removed,still awake bae
2007scape,not_removed,you might want to link your yt channel or wherever your content is
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,no it doesnt
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,yes just quit
2007scape,not_removed,dude i swear i clicked that bush lmao thnk you so much
2007scape,not_removed,did your email also have an authenticator on it if not that may have been the problem
2007scape,not_removed,well you gave away to much information and got hacked like how else would it happen
2007scape,not_removed,yes i also checked my email login history nothing suspicious
2007scape,not_removed,we both use osbuddy thats the first thing that stands out i know a lot of people do use it so in general it probably appears safe personally ive never been had any problem since using twofactor however i do use the default client you dont streamyoutube do you if so then people can catch your ip address whilst you log in and theres a way of exploiting that
2007scape,not_removed,can you explain to me how someone can bypass the authenticator on osbuddy or runescape but not the one on email
2007scape,not_removed,what that doesnt explain the google authenticator bypass
2007scape,not_removed,well no dont assume i gave away information clicked weird links or that i download anything sketchy stuff im just here to try and get to the bottom of how i got hacked so it doesnt happen again if youre not going to be helpful please dont comment thanks
2007scape,not_removed,we do stream i do believe we were targeted
2007scape,not_removed,they find out your email password and your rs password and just disable the authenticator with the email
2007scape,not_removed,they disable the authenticator with the email
2007scape,not_removed,does your email have auth
2007scape,not_removed,sure it does if you gave away too much information then you probably got recovered in turn that would disable your authenticator
2007scape,not_removed,probably at least part of your answer jagex security is somewhat laughable when compared to most other big brand game services i think the main reason i havent been hacked is due to luck rather than safety measures
2007scape,not_removed,yes i also checked the login activity nothing odd
2007scape,not_removed,but nobody was on my email address
2007scape,not_removed,exactly they didnt need your email they recovered your rs account with enough irl information and jagex changed the password for them auth is useless in that situation
2007scape,not_removed,okay but our passwords were never changed just our bank were raided
2007scape,not_removed,then you dont have auth and u got ratted
2007scape,not_removed,why are you assuming i dont have auth i told you i do every time i log in i have to check my phone for a digit pin if your not going to be helpful please dont comment im honestly just trying to prevent this from happening again
2007scape,not_removed,then if i had to guess you had a rat and either the rat did it fromyour comp or got enough info from you somehow on your comp to recover
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt it only drop
2007scape,not_removed,no idea was wondering the same
2007scape,not_removed,when you hit rdt it always drops in
2007scape,not_removed,well that makes me feel a llttle better
2007scape,not_removed,why so sad its drop
2007scape,not_removed,if notim sorry your rng is toast
2007scape,not_removed,rdt drops are always multiplied by at sire rdt so technically sire doubles gp ban abyssal sire
2007scape,not_removed,either way i guess its always disappointing to see left halfspear in green text lol
2007scape,not_removed,hate that
2007scape,not_removed,you have to world hop to a different world then you can go
2007scape,not_removed,nah just gotta log out and back in and youre sweet
2007scape,not_removed,also if you use a party client to worldhop once you redeem the token it glitches out the client client thinks its on a world and shows that world you chose yet youre still stuck in the world using the ge and interacting with items is slightly amusing once this happens
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i know it just sucks
2007scape,not_removed,that you have to click once in the world hopping list damn the struggle fam
2007scape,not_removed,twice tbh
2007scape,not_removed,no you have to click log out and type your password back in its a hassle
2007scape,not_removed,yh simply world hopping works for me
2007scape,not_removed,i thought id add a quick explanation of how i came up with some of the rewards some are just alternate versions of existing rewards like more of an existing teleport for others nothing stuck out so i looked at the tasks for that tier and tried to think of new rewards that related to them thus most of the varrock additions
2007scape,not_removed,some good points here i think a main focus should be to have consistency in the number of teleports for each tier diary
2007scape,not_removed,addition hard three daily teleports to the ardougne farm patch lol
2007scape,not_removed,i will only support increasing diary rewards if jagex solemnly pledges to also continue to expand the requirements alongside new content for example fossil island should include diary tasks for whatever its closest to morytania and wiss should include multiple wildy tasks otherwise rewards will balloon while the reqs stagnate
2007scape,not_removed,im all for it the karamja store needs to be removed and the stepping stone is useless for elite cause you can already tp to the slayer master id also suggest making staves cost more like or cause its insane amount of profit for no work
2007scape,not_removed,lazy cunts just skill and do the elite diaries instead of demanding easy scape
2007scape,not_removed,i got the kracken pet while i was reading this but i think that a few of the hard diary rewards for example the hard ardy diary gives teleports is a little over powered i think the one is balanced but i do like the mithril bar notes from mithril dragons and the ropes at the kalphite lair
2007scape,not_removed,that is one thing i tried to do since it has been a popular request i also tried to add more scaling rewards like the fight caves tokkul bonus on karamja though i tried not to overdo it so it didnt take away from the higher tiers
2007scape,not_removed,im fine with how it is but players keep asking for it
2007scape,not_removed,explorers ring gives teleports at medium how is giving at ardy hard overpowered
2007scape,not_removed,i would like that but it is a bit awkward for players who completed them already like if a new skill came out and got a task in most diaries would you be locked out of all rewards until you trained it
2007scape,not_removed,ive done most the elite diaries and am close to finishing the others i suggest this not for easyscape but for balance some rewards are rather useless if they are locked behind the elite tier like the shilo stepping stones other tiers just lack rewards in general and could be more fleshed out
2007scape,not_removed,explorers ring gives teleports to the farm patch at medium how is teleports to a farm patch at hard op
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt say overpowered did i also just fyi not all content in the game has to be the fucking same
2007scape,not_removed,thats a tough one but the only real answer is yes if they have all the other tasks done already theyd likely already have the reqs if not its only one thing to train to regain it
2007scape,not_removed,thats true didnt think about that p
2007scape,not_removed,seeing as most of jagex is on vacation and the is a sunday im going to go and say no they said upcoming not day of
2007scape,not_removed,would it be uk time because i need to know this information and how do u find out if it will be available
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah truth you preech
2007scape,not_removed,but yeah when they announce the datetime its instant if you want a rare name you have to be online the minute they go up i got my letter that way
2007scape,not_removed,bandos boots have ranged def tho
2007scape,not_removed,primordials are only over dragon so you want them to be a item bandos boots were already buffed this seems like a thread that says my merch failed bail me out updates
2007scape,not_removed,hehehehe what an honest and transparent post
2007scape,not_removed,what
2007scape,not_removed,i wonder if he got the pet
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure he hasnt gotten pet yet either
2007scape,not_removed,hows the profit now from wintertodt is it worth doing early stages on an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,he got pets along the way to and accidentally incinerated both of them he didnt get a third one by the time he finished
2007scape,not_removed,incinerated how could he lose the pets did he not insure them
2007scape,not_removed,incinerated how could he lose the pets the newly added bank feature that destroys items did he not insure them i guess not
2007scape,not_removed,kc dry for the pet wont be getting it from todt ever
2007scape,not_removed,you know you might have gotten more totem pieces if you assembled the totem you can get anymore pieces until you have a completed one
2007scape,not_removed,not a problem didnt know what kill you got it on
2007scape,not_removed,so youre okay with killing dogs in large quantities for sport but cutting off their head and carrying it around with you is going too far got it
2007scape,not_removed,why michael vick is the real villian here
2007scape,not_removed,acp switch ew
2007scape,not_removed,first clip was meeleing with acp on this sure is gonna be slmething edit and getting fulled and agsing on prot meele this is good sht that was probably the worst hybrid vid ive seen cmon mate i wanted itto be good and say something nice but nothing good happened at all it was all bad clips
2007scape,not_removed,dude why the fuck do you keep pasting this
2007scape,not_removed,autoswitch lol good banter u dumb cunt only read the line
2007scape,not_removed,absolutely and unarguably yes only issue is that each passing second more and more people give less and less fucks about dmm
2007scape,not_removed,threw
2007scape,not_removed,panic buy school wifi
2007scape,not_removed,its pretty chill that runescape doesnt take much wifi can pretty much chill full time afk wc or fishing or if school is to boring wintertoadd
2007scape,not_removed,actually if we could make all of them within the walls of the ge that would be fantastic
2007scape,not_removed,if thats what the community wants
2007scape,not_removed,na devalues my holy sandal flipping alt make it one tile at the ge
2007scape,not_removed,apparently
2007scape,not_removed,posting on reddit is pretty much your appeal process
2007scape,not_removed,thats unfortunate
2007scape,not_removed,find a friend within levels of you and try to match every mins what level are you
2007scape,not_removed,could do wilderness bosses i think they drop totems right
2007scape,not_removed,boosting will get you banned
2007scape,not_removed,im more asking for when i make a hcim i have a friend who has a level pure or something i was thinking whenever i pass by bh i can multilog and see if i can get matched
2007scape,not_removed,they do on world not too sure on the droprate though
2007scape,not_removed,where does it say that
2007scape,not_removed,i have a friend who has a level pure or something you will spend a long time trying to actually get matched to one another afaik theres no way to force it and youll be in a very popular combat bracket for bh worlds
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i believe the lesser bosses are
2007scape,not_removed,i had alts which i used to get a pouch for my main and ironman and someone must have reported them for farming and they got banned
2007scape,not_removed,oh wtf did your ironman get banned too
2007scape,not_removed,no only the alts
2007scape,not_removed,posting a comment of a friend here gave met tripple the karma i had before didnt reach my amount of yt subs doe p
2007scape,not_removed,cancer
2007scape,not_removed,lol you used to be a smiley right
2007scape,not_removed,jau miegot jau means now sleep now for anyone wondering please teach a friend lithuanian he even fails at that
2007scape,not_removed,lol rip double rangers
2007scape,not_removed,bruh
2007scape,not_removed,im for skilling updates that dont increase afk or xp rates basically qol and perks im not from hexis and i dont consider myself primarily a skiller however im a firm believer that if something isnt broken dont fix it or try to add on to it if you are a skiller you should be happy with xp rates remaining the same so your achievements arent devalued if thats not the case you probably just want things to become easier for your own sake
2007scape,not_removed,im primarily a skiller and im the exact opposite of a hexis member i just prefer to do the methods that are more suitable to me personally no matter how inefficient they are but most of the comments i see from high level players regarding skilling suggestions are really reasonable it seems that most of them are just concerned about low effort methods closing the gap to high effort methods which i totally understand i just want methods in each skill that offer diverse balances of xp gp and effort and i havent seen any indication that the high level skilling community has a problem with that yeah they get a little silly when they use hyperbole like soulspan but im glad that we have people who care so much about the balancing of skilling and they know the meta better than anyone else so i trust them a lot more than the pvm stars who only skill for quest requirements
2007scape,not_removed,its too bad we cant get any worth while skilling updates
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think u understand the actual problem with zeah rc or redwoods it has very little to do with the xp rates we just got skillcape perks idk it seems to fit your description if u actually think hexis runs the game i have a bridge in manchester to sell u
2007scape,not_removed,im a level skiller semi new to os but player since mid what the hell os this hexis thing im so confused
2007scape,not_removed,thousands of people have skills why should you get it easier than they did
2007scape,not_removed,i agree with this for the most part metas need to very slowly increase in efficiency over time to keep the content accessible to newer players there is most definitely a fine line between creative and marginal increases and absolutely lazy op bullshit i think what a lot of the people on this sub fear is the lazy op bullshit tidal wave that came about with while i can understand that this sub can get so hyperbolic sometimes that replacing the verb devalue with trigger would make it look like the radfem corner of fucking tumblr
2007scape,not_removed,amen
2007scape,not_removed,fuck hexis tbh they should have no say over how the game gets shaped they are a tiny group of people who just want to brag about how good they are and dont even play this game for any other reason than to gloat
2007scape,not_removed,its also possibile to just want more methods availabile
2007scape,not_removed,i agree in a sense at the same time though i disagree because just say if the most efficient method for a skill is something you can do from and a new method comes in and doesnt offer either more xphr even if its minimal or more gphr it is dead content basically on release i cant see the skilling community agreeing on major new skilling updates anytime soon tbh
2007scape,not_removed,what about adding more unique stuff that comes available at certain levels preferably high levels with low xp rates whether its a money making method or just untradeables i dont know about you guys but id love to see more of that also it doesnt devalue your hard earned xp
2007scape,not_removed,how would you like the thread to start
2007scape,not_removed,i have a bridge in manchester brooklyn to sell u ftfy
2007scape,not_removed,good to know someone can have an opinion and be told to kill themselves via hardasses on a mmorpg dddddd
2007scape,not_removed,youre completely missing the point i dont give a fuck about how easy it is to get im more so talking about the addition of content
2007scape,not_removed,except you cant always do that without devaluing another like i said add qol and perks to current methods like obtaining seeds from farming patches as you mentioned you dont need a skill to become afk every skilling update
2007scape,not_removed,lets talk about that actually
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure i know where my own bridge is
2007scape,not_removed,if you dont make it easier nobody will do it and people will complain about dead content
2007scape,not_removed,just found your twitter you say you dont consider yourself a skiller youre maxed total alt
2007scape,not_removed,thats just not true dead content is something that offers nothing
2007scape,not_removed,yeah ive done skilling but its not what i choose to invest my time and energy into atm
2007scape,not_removed,well if it matters im total only and barely skill and i agree with uhutchensrs
2007scape,not_removed,get fm and do wintertodt then more slayer
2007scape,not_removed,so i just logged back into my account these are my stats i have no armour mill in the bank and no clue where to start im kind of overwhelmed right now did any major changes happen to any skills or money making merhods that i should try which quests should i tackle first what should i invest my mill intogearskillsge thanks for any help
2007scape,not_removed,just do whatever you feel like doing thats my general rule about osrs
2007scape,not_removed,skill and get barrows gloves
2007scape,not_removed,if you want to start out and get a decent amount of money get fm and do wintertodt til shouldnt take too long other than that get that con and hunter up barrows gloves and slayer would be really good to start out if you want to do pvm
2007scape,not_removed,always want to knock out barrows gloves on any account asap then probably slayer whatever you find fun really
2007scape,not_removed,what gear should i buy at the moment i have no clue what is viable anymore p when i logged in i was training ranged with blue dhide and a magic bow
2007scape,not_removed,get a whip and d scimmy for melee and rune cbow if that lvl range permits cant remember the level off the top of my head also like others are saying get barrows gloves they are really good could grind fighter torso if you felt like it but its not necessary imo
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i approve of this shit meme
2007scape,not_removed,its faster exp and ppl love to buy skills so blast mining is now how u buy mining which makes mining officially a buyable skill
2007scape,not_removed,more people realizing how good it is supply cant keep up with demand
2007scape,not_removed,you can buy from store starting at like
2007scape,not_removed,lol thats hilarious u lose money at that price
2007scape,not_removed,how fast is it it cant be faster than granite
2007scape,not_removed,it is faster from my understanding at least
2007scape,not_removed,its like maybe granite is
2007scape,not_removed,imo stick with stevenieve always for the accessability direct teleport
2007scape,not_removed,use duradel if you want more boss tasks
2007scape,not_removed,i have karamja hard done so i have the tele but i also have seed pod so id say the accessibility is the same for both of them for me are there any other reasons to stick with steve over duradel
2007scape,not_removed,you have to do it within your os i did this and kinda regret it cause the recoil notifier was quite handy and i cant quite find the option to turn the notifications back on
2007scape,not_removed,ye but the ge notificater is sooo annoying for flipping
2007scape,not_removed,maybe thats just how he wants to train agility
2007scape,not_removed,the full granite is what really makes this great
2007scape,not_removed,i made a post about this about a week ago where i was completely stuck seems to be happening to a fair few people
2007scape,not_removed,i agree
2007scape,not_removed,can confirm
2007scape,not_removed,wall supports are ready
2007scape,not_removed,you are a witch
2007scape,not_removed,on release day for i had this route and i could just walk across that part somehow
2007scape,not_removed,an illusion what are you hiding
2007scape,not_removed,i dont get it use the other route
2007scape,not_removed,i dont have dragonbarrows stuff except for legs but tomorrow qc so thats nice also didnt want to risk the rare stuff since its instanced
2007scape,not_removed,its a bug when you click on the second wall support instead of the first one the game thinks you are on the way to the right i was still able to finish the part though
2007scape,not_removed,rune would be better here not much worse stats but so much lighter
2007scape,not_removed,true i alched most of it though lol
2007scape,not_removed,its for the rag and bone quest smh
2007scape,not_removed,fuck me right
2007scape,not_removed,the wish list miniquest specifically
2007scape,not_removed,if your hot id fuck you
2007scape,not_removed,are you sure it was the same account most people have a separate account dedicated to double check this was not the case
2007scape,not_removed,did you possibly log into a deadman mode server instead of a normal one
2007scape,not_removed,this happened to me too but way earlier on when osrs first came out i played quite a bit got through multitudes of questlines dt mm etc and was up to like a combats lvl took a several month runescape hiatus came back to osrs on tutorial island
2007scape,not_removed,can you elaborate a bit more on not having a character anymore
2007scape,not_removed,just search ur characters username in the highscores if you see the stats then it exists and you mightve entered the wrong info
2007scape,not_removed,you played you never played osrs
2007scape,not_removed,im sure it was this account i always use this information for stuff
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt seem like thats the casei just clicked to log into a free world like normal
2007scape,not_removed,this seems like its my issue right now i hope a mod sees this d
2007scape,not_removed,well i logged into the game just a little bit ago since i saw i could be a free player for a bit now until i become a member again and i had to create a new characteron an account i was sure had a player
2007scape,not_removed,i just searched the high scores and its not therebut why would my character be gone
2007scape,not_removed,no no im certain i did i even have the old email from when i signed up for osrs ive actually never even played
2007scape,not_removed,sounds like you might have logged into a deadman mode server
2007scape,not_removed,characters not on the high scores are due to all skills are very low levels the character was banned from the game i suggest you contact jagex
2007scape,not_removed,you have the wrong account then accounts dont get reset or deleted or items removed or anything you want to call it
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt seem like thats the caseim really confused
2007scape,not_removed,why do people even watch her when there is free pron on the interwebs
2007scape,not_removed,she has turned into every other female twitch streamer sad that i used to like her vids on youtube when she was popular back then
2007scape,not_removed,literally who and why should i give a shit
2007scape,not_removed,i bet she doesnt even tic

2007scape,not_removed,thats fucked up dude
2007scape,not_removed,redberry pie does she have herpes

2007scape,not_removed,im so happy i rediscovered rs and subsequently this sub
2007scape,not_removed,waaaaarm redberrry pie
2007scape,not_removed,nah i heard that was sicknerd
2007scape,not_removed,i do that all the time its easier than cleaning up
2007scape,not_removed,how do you eat your own load unlegit
2007scape,not_removed,so what was it laughing out loud or giggling please deliver op
2007scape,not_removed,can you diagram what your face is instead like
2007scape,not_removed,w
2007scape,not_removed,most people have herpes they just dont know
2007scape,not_removed,havent played in a while but the memes are idd golden
2007scape,not_removed,i dont even play memes anymore i just come here for the osrs
2007scape,not_removed,good meme
2007scape,not_removed,i only log in once a year so my character isnt lost and i probably couldnt get into it again since the game changed so much but rs memes never disappoint
2007scape,not_removed,same but it gets me to log in again because the memes are that dank
2007scape,not_removed,only if the redberry pie is warm
2007scape,not_removed,fucking sub is
2007scape,not_removed,let your body do the work
2007scape,not_removed,we thoroughly appreciate your honesty
2007scape,not_removed,gol
2007scape,not_removed,stfu kiiiiid
2007scape,not_removed,mhannah
2007scape,not_removed,characters dont get lost
2007scape,not_removed,kid
2007scape,not_removed,i remember receiving emails urging me to log in
2007scape,not_removed,i remember quitting my account in cause i couldnt figure out where i was
2007scape,not_removed,every once in awhile they clear usernames thats about it though if you log in after that point your name would just be something like and it makes you change it accounts arent deleted
2007scape,not_removed,why would you want to give up archer ring and if you cant tribrid and only want to kill rex and prime then i suggest that you use trident and crystal bow instead of pipe since you dont know the aggro range
2007scape,not_removed,if you really want to do this its possible by hugging the wall and using a long range weapon to kill prime blowpipe would be faster and youll need to telegrab the loot but its definitely possible to kill only rexprime
2007scape,not_removed,ive done it before with rcb and pipe you just have to make sure he wonders close with the pipe before you aggro him but the mage has got pretty crappy drops comapred to rangebut with noted bones its worth it
2007scape,not_removed,thats the exact reason why i dont want to tribrid i was at dks only once and killed only rex so im quite unexperienced at it
2007scape,not_removed,what are your stats its definitely possible to only kill rex and prime but it may not be the best option for you i understand that it may seem quite difficult and scary but it really isnt if you do decide to only kill prime and rex dont forget to take telegrab with you
2007scape,not_removed,att str def range mage though im quite bad when it comes to bossing so yea im afraid to do such things
2007scape,not_removed,you can easily tribrid with those stats i can do it easily with worse look up a guide its not as hard as it seems
2007scape,not_removed,ok thanks ill give it a try
2007scape,not_removed,cannonballs are per hr but are afk for each inventory if you have stats you can kill green drags you can do blast furnace you can make it a cooking alt
2007scape,not_removed,flipping is one with no req
2007scape,not_removed,charging glories at fountain of rune is good money if you can manage to not get yourself killed
2007scape,not_removed,blast furnace is likely best has almost no reqs to start getting around just do iron bars if you dont have coal bag they arnt much worse than steel afk mlm on alt for coal bag while you do more intense things on main if you want to do steel or higher
2007scape,not_removed,qp req
2007scape,not_removed,nice mon
2007scape,not_removed,nice setup
2007scape,not_removed,dank desk i need to upgrade mine i will when i move at the beginning of the year i myself prefer having the tower out of sight but atleast yours is looks good unlike my stock lenovo tower lol
2007scape,not_removed,what desk is that or what it some random one you got at store
2007scape,not_removed,if i remeber i will upload a pic when i get home from work
2007scape,not_removed,youre charger in your tablet doesnt look all the way connected
2007scape,not_removed,i wish i had a better answer for you but im really not sure its one my parents got me a few years back for christmas
2007scape,not_removed,nice catch lol
2007scape,not_removed,just play on a rsps where you can spawn basic brid gear for free that way you can practice without loosing money you might get outbridded alot starting off but you will learn from getting beat by people
2007scape,not_removed,use ahk and automate of everything just make sure to be
2007scape,not_removed,os scape will be your best bet until you are confident enough to go back to osrs
2007scape,not_removed,know of any good ones
2007scape,not_removed,do you have a script i could use
2007scape,not_removed,os scape
2007scape,not_removed,make ur own
2007scape,not_removed,i dont recommend this it doesnt actually make you any better other than artificially bridging takes time early days you will often get rekt but once you get more and more experience you will be much better practice makes perfect
2007scape,not_removed,google the stats and look at which number is higher
2007scape,not_removed,abyssal dagger
2007scape,not_removed,in order from best to worst bludgeon dagger sotd saradomin sword dscim defender
2007scape,not_removed,blessed ss bludegon dagger sotd ss
2007scape,not_removed,dharoks beat those all
2007scape,not_removed,maybe go suck your dukes instead
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,im not op but can i ask you if the difference between dagger and bludgeon is really huge or not because its so expensive
2007scape,not_removed,dharoks slayer ye
2007scape,not_removed,my bad i assumed you could figure out which number is higher
2007scape,not_removed,crush str bludgeon vs stab str daggerdefender for the average player its probably not worth it
2007scape,not_removed,lmao there is a reason why i came here g
2007scape,not_removed,you also get decent amount of def bonus from defender so i personally use dagger over bludgeon
2007scape,not_removed,because you dont know how to spell wiki
2007scape,not_removed,no because i dont feel like looking it up
2007scape,not_removed,yea ur fucked make a new account probably get a new computer too
2007scape,not_removed,never
2007scape,not_removed,rng gone perm
2007scape,not_removed,finally posted it nice
2007scape,not_removed,would you rather squee or xd
2007scape,not_removed,rhumblebrag
2007scape,not_removed,it didnt even get better graphical update than on that simple white body doubt theyll update following animation
2007scape,not_removed,can it not pets are enough screen clutter as is
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,i think it looks pretty awesome as it is
2007scape,not_removed,i thought this was obvious higher level than me no life lower level than me noob applies to wealth also
2007scape,not_removed,why is that dude holding his staff lefty
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,guy is wearing a fucking glory with bis melee noob
2007scape,not_removed,looking at total lvl compared to gear when i see a lvl with total and best in slot gear bandos sgs bludgeon automatically a noob also anyone wearing a d med get the fuck off my game
2007scape,not_removed,everyones a fucking noob
2007scape,not_removed,that guy with the trident does seem to be fairly confused though
2007scape,not_removed,take my upvote
2007scape,not_removed,spicy
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,a noob is basically someone who pvms and gets skulltricked or lured lol
2007scape,not_removed,i guess woox is the only one not a noob then
2007scape,not_removed,def noobskill return
2007scape,not_removed,theory of noobativity
2007scape,not_removed,none of them have skillcapes they are all noob indeed
2007scape,not_removed,why is the first maxed pvmer on the left wearing a glory not even a fury common noob
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure the noob thing is for not optimal gear at ur level rather than low lvl gear for example using a combat bracelet d chain etc
2007scape,not_removed,remember the days when noob just meant new
2007scape,not_removed,is this a fractal system this noob relativity or is it a spectrum
2007scape,not_removed,does that noob have a max cape man noob standards sure have gone way up
2007scape,not_removed,alternatively for wealth higher than me rwt scum lower than me rwt scum
2007scape,not_removed,relativity
2007scape,not_removed,there is some truth to it the higher level you are the more time and effort and money you have to put into your account thus meaning you have less time effort money for putting into your real life vs someone who has a low total level they have put less time effort and money into their account and are a noob but that just means that have more time effort and money to be putting into other aspects of life there are exceptions to the rule ofc
2007scape,not_removed,had to flip a couple of the characters around to make them face the right direction p
2007scape,not_removed,could be strength ammy fighting a def pure
2007scape,not_removed,bro d med is classic fashionscape
2007scape,not_removed,barrows setup probably
2007scape,not_removed,ha yeah my cooking cape is way better than these nerds
2007scape,not_removed,that is a wilderness team cape coincidentally my main is muted and is in camelot here take this teletab
2007scape,not_removed,legend cape he may be a noob but at least he quests
2007scape,not_removed,higher wealth than me rwt scum lower wealth than me noob ftfy
2007scape,not_removed,your maymays are appreciated mr whore crusher
2007scape,not_removed,its pretty over the top as far as barrows goes imo
2007scape,not_removed,thats a team cape
2007scape,not_removed,found the noob
2007scape,not_removed,i think he means if you are richer you buy gp and if you have less cash then you sell it
2007scape,not_removed,hsoohw
2007scape,not_removed,he was saying lower levels are bots that rwt i think
2007scape,not_removed,maybe dks
2007scape,not_removed,bingo bango
2007scape,not_removed,i think it is a bad dks setup considering its one of the few places you need a ton of prayer bonus and mage
2007scape,not_removed,bongo
2007scape,not_removed,i dont want to leave the congo
2007scape,not_removed,jealous cuz ur all alone
2007scape,not_removed,i fuck hoes on a daily basis bro get your bitchass back to rs
2007scape,not_removed,shortest ingame time or shortest account creation time this sounds fun maybe ill participate if i have time edit idea for more cathegories ultimate ironman and lowest cmb level
2007scape,not_removed,too much work for a bondthanks doe
2007scape,not_removed,within the time to do dragon slayer i can buy myself one
2007scape,not_removed,how exactly are you going to keep track of account when someone could just run members and use teletabs
2007scape,not_removed,idea make them record every time logged in
2007scape,not_removed,gimme bond fgt
2007scape,not_removed,is there any proof that youre willing to give these bonds away what if people spend the following weeks doing this challenge and you decide not do give prizes in the end
2007scape,not_removed,shortest in game time also both of those categories seem like fun ideas
2007scape,not_removed,most likely ingame time it would be unfair to count the hours where you need to go eatsleep etc so thats fair and the same for everyone
2007scape,not_removed,the point is to speedrun have fun and challenge yourself not to maximize profit bruh
2007scape,not_removed,unfortunately there isnt really a great way to combat this a combination of the highscores plus trusting that people will be honorable and a prize that doesnt really encourage people to cheat if anyone else has ideas im all ears
2007scape,not_removed,yes because there isnt a realistic way to determine who has traded it to themselves and who hasnt unless the person were to stream everything from creation to completion
2007scape,not_removed,i assume you can as there is a separate ironman category for nontrading speedruns
2007scape,not_removed,good point
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,is the troll we deserve but not the one we need right now
2007scape,not_removed,hi
2007scape,not_removed,bro we have raids scheduled for before xmas and no melee armor and no ones talking about it they r just posting great demon memes
2007scape,not_removed,oh this guy is afk im gonna shoot him with magic shortbow in rune legs torso
2007scape,not_removed,geno wouldnt have failed just sayin
2007scape,not_removed,that laugh lol
2007scape,not_removed,serp helm and berserker ring
2007scape,not_removed,now only if being better at the game allowed you to actually hit harder lol xdd
2007scape,not_removed,he wasnt risking torture
2007scape,not_removed,vod link for chat reaction
2007scape,not_removed,damn almost got really happy that lost money
2007scape,not_removed,people still watch uh
2007scape,not_removed,wow that kid streamer is annoying wish he died
2007scape,not_removed,fun fact torso has no negative range stats rune legs however
2007scape,not_removed,who gives a fuck random
2007scape,not_removed,maybe just maybe it was on accident wow i know right probably not
2007scape,not_removed,fuck that im just sad the ags hit in specs
2007scape,not_removed,its a copy paste lol
2007scape,not_removed,kek
2007scape,not_removed,copy pasta
2007scape,not_removed,the quest isnt bad you are
2007scape,not_removed,hop worlds if you cant seem to progress sometimes the guards get out of sync and it becomes nearly impossible
2007scape,not_removed,regicide
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt have much problems with but if youre having troubles here just wait
2007scape,not_removed,ratcatchers is the perfect argument against intelligent designcheckmate christians
2007scape,not_removed,youre just bad
2007scape,not_removed,this i was stuck in the house part for like an hour doing this quest and finished it the house part in like minutes once i hopped
2007scape,not_removed,regicide took like half an hour
2007scape,not_removed,you guys like retarded or something
2007scape,not_removed,well it will probably bring down the price of bonds by a few hundred k for a while cant hurt to have more players
2007scape,not_removed,oh my sweet summer child
2007scape,not_removed,summer kids the summer kids are already in and have been since may because they are university kids because most of osrss demographic are uni students this can be seen by the fact that osrs has more players than as of late
2007scape,not_removed,time to double money in
2007scape,not_removed,lol nubs
2007scape,not_removed,hopefully a lot of them will continue to play after i started last summer and dont regret a thing
2007scape,not_removed,no big mo no party
2007scape,not_removed,rip slayer will litterally become unplayable already very overpopulated
2007scape,not_removed,still got a while til their schools out but i fell ya
2007scape,not_removed,i am confused i thought it was winter that is cumming
2007scape,not_removed,the pking has already see a few damage to this i can only fear for the the upcoming days i may be forced to ditch my toons and actually do members stuff on my mains shudder
2007scape,not_removed,its more of an annoyance having more populated worlds and people acting like idiots
2007scape,not_removed,so are you out of school when it snows or out when its sunny id assume summer but i dont know
2007scape,not_removed,honestly its easy to world hop and find a good world plus its not even as bad as some people make it out to be edit maybe it has to do with the times i play because ive never had a significant issue with slaying hell hounds or anything ever and ive played since release
2007scape,not_removed,do you need anything else in rs
2007scape,not_removed,did you lose a blowpipe in wildy recently because you sure sound salty
2007scape,not_removed,summer kids buying bonds for quick items more bonds lower bond price
2007scape,not_removed,the vintage runescape experience
2007scape,not_removed,we already have people acting like idiots myself included
2007scape,not_removed,i just remember being blown away when an aussie was talking about christmas and said yeah christmas memories here are usually bbqs on the beach young me could barely process the degree difference
2007scape,not_removed,no snow in most places in australia
2007scape,not_removed,it is sunny every day of the year in australia
2007scape,not_removed,even with access to i had some trouble finding worlds for greatersbloodveldshell hounds back in feb
2007scape,not_removed,i think i hop around times on the days i casually slay it is very very bad
2007scape,not_removed,but the price of items will go up if kids are buying them with bond money and not actually bringing any into the game via drops
2007scape,not_removed,so when are you out of school for months then
2007scape,not_removed,stop using the cave so much then always another place to find the same mondter
2007scape,not_removed,december and january is our longest length holiday break i dont think many places have a three month break as far as i know but our other breaks through the year might be weeks longer to balance it out
2007scape,not_removed,i have tried and others have tried making older spots good as nieve but the j mods dont have time for that and slaying somewhere you cant get highest exph isnt ideal
2007scape,not_removed,i get it cuz ur gay
2007scape,not_removed,what a slut i see the mid riff harlots
2007scape,not_removed,just because the servers dont work doesnt mean your print screen button doesnt work either
2007scape,not_removed,stupid post stupid title
2007scape,not_removed,fite me ill bank squirrel
2007scape,not_removed,i dont mean to be a snob or anything when saying this but if you did wintertodt when it first came out this wasnt crazy uncommon to happen
2007scape,not_removed,random number generator
2007scape,not_removed,to further explain theres chance of getting phoenix these two people got theirs back to back in world which was filled with nonsense chat spam
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,a how did you even and b have you tried the basic lumbridge home teleport andor a minigames teleport
2007scape,not_removed,you dun goofd
2007scape,not_removed,remove a room on either side of it by reentering your house through the portal then remove that room or wait a few weeks
2007scape,not_removed,rofl this game is so fucking buggy literally a private server
2007scape,not_removed,idk i just cant enter or delete the room
2007scape,not_removed,im fine with that i was literally about to play a private server before they released old school
2007scape,not_removed,i think youd need to delete the portal room to get to it otherwise wait for the construction update that will let you rearrange rooms
2007scape,not_removed,ill just wait for update then
2007scape,not_removed,chaeldar isnt too bad partner slayer is your best option though if possible
2007scape,not_removed,do you have a high level main you can partner with
2007scape,not_removed,its really not too bad lot of shit tasks but is certainly obtainable
2007scape,not_removed,also i think you can tell slayer master to ignore your combat lvl and you will get harder tasks
2007scape,not_removed,no but how does partnering work if im partners with someone and they get s task do i get there task aswell
2007scape,not_removed,how
2007scape,not_removed,yes you get their task as long as its available to you as well for example you cant get a boss task if you didnt unlock it i personally never had a partner cause you reset the task count when you partner up but many people do it on pures
2007scape,not_removed,cool thanks
2007scape,not_removed,ngl its pretty frustrating at times i gave up doing it after getting too many tasks that werent compatible
2007scape,not_removed,what tongue thing homie
2007scape,not_removed,wtf is this spooky shit
2007scape,not_removed,not my proudest fap
2007scape,not_removed,i feel like he could pull off a great costume if the human centipede guy now that would be scary
2007scape,not_removed,sigh unzips
2007scape,not_removed,this is actually pretty well done to the team lol
2007scape,not_removed,spooked me on halloween classic
2007scape,not_removed,man mod raven can sure tell a good story
2007scape,not_removed,yeah drop those nuclear bombs for me
2007scape,not_removed,where is the nsfw on this one
2007scape,not_removed,hes still about to drop dem bars god ash
2007scape,not_removed,looks like pepe
2007scape,not_removed,im so erekt
2007scape,not_removed,im done
2007scape,not_removed,no thanks ash i hate that quest
2007scape,not_removed,wheres this from kreygasm
2007scape,not_removed,lmao did they record this the day of the last qa because theyre all in the clothes they were wearing that day especially ash and merchant
2007scape,not_removed,i cringed
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i got spooked
2007scape,not_removed,cringe
2007scape,not_removed,hahaa im and everything is cringe
2007scape,not_removed,just wait for zmi lol
2007scape,not_removed,wait for zmi bruv they stated it was nearly completed so shouldnt be long week or two at max hell ive just bought rc pure essence prob gonna have to sell half back due to double xp at zmi
2007scape,not_removed,try astrals
2007scape,not_removed,astrals
2007scape,not_removed,astrals or lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,mud runes with balloonlumberyard teles
2007scape,not_removed,im not sure but i think fire runes are the fastest second to lavas but some people say astrals so maybe astrals
2007scape,not_removed,mind runes
2007scape,not_removed,astrals are pretty chill
2007scape,not_removed,but zmi gets better at higher levels doesnt it so it would actually make sense to train rc now
2007scape,not_removed,it would be the best way to get which is what op wants
2007scape,not_removed,im laughing way too hard at this hahah
2007scape,not_removed,pretty much how everyone acts at shamans as far as ive seen
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,suffering
2007scape,not_removed,you should start going for more trips per hour id aim for getting construction and agility if you havent already spec pool fairy ring in house to zulandrah suffering saves an inventory slot so thats op also getting smithing for teles without dramen staff saves another spot if you really want to you could get armadyl but i doubt that would speed up kills much at your levels so imo more worth going for above reqs smithing and construction will cost a bit gl
2007scape,not_removed,just stake the cash bro then you dont have to be zulrah slave
2007scape,not_removed,suffering ri mage damage mage accuracy range damage range accuracy also dont use the serp helm not worth the cost in scales and has magerange if you want a hybrid helm use a slayer helm i has rangemage
2007scape,not_removed,is a suffering really worth the gp is it that helpful
2007scape,not_removed,if you can handle a big boy switch just get ranged void and just use the void ranger helm the whole time
2007scape,not_removed,get ranged void after blowpipe and toxic trident suffering is godly specially if youre lazy
2007scape,not_removed,for me it was worth it just so i dont have to monitor recoil hp also its an item you can buy and never have to sell edit ironically suffering reduces your suffering
2007scape,not_removed,if you plan on doing a ton of zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,thats the same number of switches void range topbottomgloveshelm to void range helm dhide topbottom and b gloves besides at his range level and gear dhide is probably better
2007scape,not_removed,just you
2007scape,not_removed,you fucking imbecile
2007scape,not_removed,just you
2007scape,not_removed,upvote this guy to make everyone feel smart
2007scape,not_removed,just you
2007scape,not_removed,just you
2007scape,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better when i tried rsc for the first time ever a few months ago i must have walked around for at least an hour looking for a cow tied to a rope with a milkmaid standing nearby then i tried using my bucket on the cow apparently all cows on rsc give milk who knew lol
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i had no idea what cowhide was when i first started rs back in
2007scape,not_removed,just you
2007scape,not_removed,i spent so much of my childhood in that paddock goddamn
2007scape,not_removed,thats professional logic sir requires more try harder next time
2007scape,not_removed,til people wear granite helm
2007scape,not_removed,the plug
2007scape,not_removed,dat midriff
2007scape,not_removed,respect the hustle
2007scape,not_removed,rcutenoobs
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,probably selling his sand crabs loot
2007scape,not_removed,hahaha i have once seen a spade go for so anything is possible
2007scape,not_removed,you havent trust me
2007scape,not_removed,where can you even get it
2007scape,not_removed,terror dogs in tarns lair
2007scape,not_removed,barbarian assault high gambles
2007scape,not_removed,you can also get the helm
2007scape,not_removed,rest in peace to the best days runescape will ever see stealing creation i love and miss you

2007scape,not_removed,change name from lil bol to arbolito and you got yourself a deal
2007scape,not_removed,not tier bow and it dropping logs that will devalue it the bow and i assume range means the better its bonuses maybe make this a mid level boss even low level boss instead of higher level lower levels needs stuff to do too
2007scape,not_removed,train to high enough hunter to catch eclectic imps smithing at blast furnace using truebf cc running stuff runes wyverns runecrafting killing stuff that drops seedsherbs farming herbs running whiteberrys if legit level status loot food and ammo in the bountyhunter world

2007scape,not_removed,try doing easy clues
2007scape,not_removed,farm toadflax
2007scape,not_removed,hunting ecelectic imps is over best money at low level atm
2007scape,not_removed,you catch them and sell them in ge
2007scape,not_removed,kill green dragon bots and tele your ass away as soon as you see a white dot run to you
2007scape,not_removed,begging

2007scape,not_removed,making wow dude you can make on cannonballs
2007scape,not_removed,okay cool thanks man ill check it out how much does fishing and wc make you cuz i could always do that while im not blast furnacing
2007scape,not_removed,running nats i saw in a lot of places but that seems like you need a pretty high combat level to survive it
2007scape,not_removed,you just say myspace my nigga
2007scape,not_removed,take any product that have to commission also find out the market where you can sell that affiliate product as per my personal experience you can easily start promoting any popular web hosting affiliate program u can use bluehost or hostgator for promoting those service yes try and try until you get success well dont spend whole day on that work but must spend to hours per day as part time work try every marketing tools and tricks to get high amount of targeted traffic many affiliate marketers lose those hope because they dont get commission within few weeks and they think its a bullshits so that not true you quit because you loose your hope so go for affiliate marketing and start your passive income
2007scape,not_removed,you can make doing eclectic imps
2007scape,not_removed,if you are a low combat people wont be able to attack you
2007scape,not_removed,yea that while comment was satire fam
2007scape,not_removed,eclectic imps what do they even drop thats worth loot looks bad
2007scape,not_removed,for real wtf never knew that shows how much i pk whats the level radius to not be attacked
2007scape,not_removed,you dont loot the jars you just fill your inventory with eclectic imp jars and sell them theyre worth alot each
2007scape,not_removed,you go up to around level wilderness to run natures which means players levels above or below your level can attack you
2007scape,not_removed,whatever level wilderness you are in is the difference in combat level someone needs to attack you for runecrafting you only need to go to around wilderness so for example this means that if you are level only someone between levels and can attack you
2007scape,not_removed,oh thanks didnt understand at all i remember catching some imps like years ago
2007scape,not_removed,thats not in chests getting lucky in a random streak is nothing to brag about
2007scape,not_removed,cooking is quick and profitable youll make about
2007scape,not_removed,i have about in coins in other stuff ranged armorweapons mystic set some runes open to most suggestions though ideally i would think something profitable would be great so that i can start purchasing my members via bonds doesnt need to be the most gphr if its something that also trainsprogresses my character in a meaningful way ive also always been interested by the people doing bosses and stuff like barrows though ive never tried it myself and dont know if theres something i should do stats i should level before doing so thanks in advance
2007scape,not_removed,get torso ba is easy to learn and doesnt take long to get
2007scape,not_removed,id say start working towards barrows gloves that should round your account out nicely
2007scape,not_removed,get everything to then keep doing what you like
2007scape,not_removed,work for barrow gloves recipe for disaster youll get a lot of things done and much needed armour improvements once youve done that youll probably be ready to do barrows since youre a little inexperienced but youll have better gear to tackle them with
2007scape,not_removed,questing questing questing the sooner the better really at the start they look slow but they add up so quickly you wont even notice
2007scape,not_removed,firemaking cuz its low
2007scape,not_removed,a big thing for me is varrock battlestaves i would say work towards any varrock diarys you can do and train your crafting to for air battlestaves and start buying the daily battlestaves as well as making the air battlestaves then alch them youll slowly work on your crafting magic and make money
2007scape,not_removed,do you know about how long it takes and how much start up gold id need
2007scape,not_removed,barrow gloves qp rfd fire cape range comes in handy berserker ring fury slayer helmet slay points or neitiznot helmet just train slayer for money you will get a lot of herbsseedsrunesrune and addy items if you dont have the money to buy a berserker ring go with a ring of wealth it will pick your coins from the ground when you kill a monster skills like mining woodcutting fishing thieving hunter runecrafting will get you money aswell bossing first get strattdefence and get yourself someone who knows how to boss and teach you barrows if you got pray slay and magic not sure on the magic level you can kill the barrows witg slayer dart alternatives are ibans blast and trident staff
2007scape,not_removed,someone had actually suggested that to me earlier today while doing a slayer task so far i got my points in healer and attacker as well as queen kills plan on tackling defense and collector tomorrow thanks for the suggestion
2007scape,not_removed,are there any really good barrows specific guides youve used and wood recommend plan was to just follow the wiki guides but if you know of something better thatd be awesome
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the big reply were those items in any particular order or just a list of things to plan on completing also regarding the ring of wealth should i be using that instead of my warrior ring while doing slayer tasks also i saw people on the subreddit talking about using the new slayer bracelets instead of barrows gloves based on tasks i just checked and my current task is bloodvelds would they be something i want to skipuse the expeditious bracelet on
2007scape,not_removed,quest guides got me mine theyre awesome
2007scape,not_removed,no those items are just a few standard items to get also fighters torso but someone already mentioned it warriors ring will boost your attack i dont see any use for it but thats me xd if youre training strenght use a berserker ring otherwise i use the wealth barrow gloves are good to have when youre training or killing when not doing slayer when you are training slayer you can use the silver jewelry because it extends your slayer tasks bloodvelds are awesome for money and slayer i kill them in the catacomb of kourend because they are stronger and the drops are better but on low level you will need to use prayer for them
2007scape,not_removed,catacombs of kourend is that new zeah continent stuff right i have absolutely no knowledge about zeah lol do you recommend going there instead of doing bloodvelds in the stronghold cave i never seem to get anything worth much money from them though youre right about the xp being awesome
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it is the zeah continent the monsters are higher and stronger in the catacomb bloodvelds drop more rune items and blood runes last trip i had blood runes
2007scape,not_removed,are there any special requirements to be able to get theredo mobs in that area
2007scape,not_removed,no not at all there is a boat next to the boat to pest control it will bring you to the docks of zeah i dont know if you know this site but its the official oldschool runescape wikipedia but if you still have questions i will answer them aswell xd
2007scape,not_removed,no more slots is a perk for members
2007scape,not_removed,ge has nothing to do with quests
2007scape,not_removed,jagex has already done more than enough by making the game available for free yes there are massive restrictions but that is the point why would jagex want to give more incentive for people not to subscribe the would lose money if you really want that reward then go no life yews and buy a bond d

2007scape,not_removed,lol basically buying gp use bonds
2007scape,not_removed,def range mage are good baseline minimums to start zulrah defeating zulrah is more about learning the patterns and tactics and slowly becoming more effecient most people are reactive when they first start zulrah then most seasoned vets of zulrah are proactive higher stats and better gear will obviously make trips easier longer and more profitable but you dont need to wait til your max or near max and bis gear to start
2007scape,not_removed,its possible with your stats even better with mage and range but even if you learn it youre not going to get anywhere near the large gphr figures you see people talking about without mage and range and access to agility shortcut if you are just looking for a money maker blast furnace with the coal bag is gphr steel addy runite
2007scape,not_removed,possible whit
2007scape,not_removed,i had kc on my account that got hacked and couldnt be recovered so i know the rotations and everything but mage range and defence would suffice
2007scape,not_removed,good idea how long does coal bag take
2007scape,not_removed,approx pay dirt
2007scape,not_removed,more than a few hours
2007scape,not_removed,i hate ifone users iphone is love
2007scape,not_removed,yes its allowed you arent having party software play the game for you
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,le edgy gangster eckssdee
2007scape,not_removed,tick wood cutting is bug abuse and should be patched anyways
2007scape,not_removed,i play this game to make other people angry this is not your safespace
2007scape,not_removed,the way i see it is if someone wants to put more effort into the game to get things done faster then so be it just like other normal methods that range from afk to click intensive some players like to choose the most difficult method for fun or just to compete i for one cant for the life of me be bothered to do any or tick methods but if people can for hours so be it
2007scape,not_removed,dont cry when yourself or others get banned this is not your safe space either
2007scape,not_removed,the way i see it is if someone wants to put more effort into the game to get things done faster then so be it i agree jagex should design ways to train skills that take this into account but what is currently happening is not intentional and clearly a bug
2007scape,not_removed,like boaty said if i click times where others click once then i do deserve better xp
2007scape,not_removed,dont cry when griefers griefing nonstreamers dont get banned this is not your safe space either
2007scape,not_removed,exactly how i feel let people choose their own path and if they want to do a shit tonne of work to get better xp then let them its literally how the game works
2007scape,not_removed,nobody cry games are meant to be pleasant
2007scape,not_removed,i dont
2007scape,not_removed,qa video for the youtube channel handles some community eventslivestreams some people claim it could be done by another jmod and it could however it would obviously detract from them doing their own jobs he is needed some people just dont like him for whatever their reasons are
2007scape,not_removed,from what i see hes pretty much a community manager which is definitely a role needed by someone on the osrs team everyone doesnt have to do the same jobs or have the same skills its my belief that any gaming company needs someone to fill that role in order to bridge the gap between creator and user
2007scape,not_removed,hes a preeoc fanboy that is likely responsible pitchingsupporting the idea behind the scenes for a lot of the preeocesque updates the past year or so
2007scape,not_removed,you mean the good updates that have allowed the game to become popular and prevented the game from becoming stale due to people wearing nostalgia glasses
2007scape,not_removed,nah that would be the community you all have tbh
2007scape,not_removed,no not the good updates the boring updates that weve already experienced in the previous game genius
2007scape,not_removed,that weve already experienced in the previous game the whole game is based on the previous game are you actually serious
2007scape,not_removed,the game is based on oldschool experience which can be achieved with new unique content that promotes oldschool gameplay preeoc content doesnt do that are you actually serious
2007scape,not_removed,the game is based on preeoc content before eoc are you intentionally acting stupid or is this legitimate
2007scape,not_removed,no youre just trying to be a smartass because i got your panties in a twist about archie being a preeoc fanboy everyone and their mother knows preeoc refers to genius try again
2007scape,not_removed,not really you tried to insinuate that any good update wasnt in preeoc preeoc is defined as before eoc which means before the end of youre in the small minority of people that have their heads stuck up their ass that they dont want the game to progress
2007scape,not_removed,youre in the small minority of people that have their heads stuck up their ass that they dont want the game to progress no i was actually one of the first people to suggest that we can update oldschool without it becoming washed up like preeoc youre just being an ass and no preeoc is referred to as youre an idiot if you think otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,preeoc literally means before the evolution of combat which is anything before just because a small narrow minded claims it isnt doesnt mean youre correct youre literally trying to argue semantics a super majority of updates are polled by the community so youre clearly in the minority when you say no one wants preeoc updates but youve clearly shown that you have no idea what you are talking about if you think itll become washed up like preeoc even though people were quite happy with preeoc anyway when there are a shit ton of qol and content updates from preeoc that people want please go find a private server as youll probably find something that will quench your nostalgic delusions
2007scape,not_removed,youre still trying to tell me what preeoc is when everybody besides a few asshats like yourself knows its referring to the short period of time before eoc you do realize theres stages within the timeline of the game ill help your dumbass out classic old school was just simply a shit year preeoc go flick the back of your neck so you and everyone around you can see how much of an idiot you are
2007scape,not_removed,preeoc before evolution of combat as i said before youre literally trying to argue semantics like an austic neckbeard sorry you dont understand english and have no concept of what the game is theres a reason people like you are in the minority and are unable to ruin the updates the majority want lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,they are asleep at this hr
2007scape,not_removed,sorry summoning is only in youre gonna have to keep reporting them until you get the osrs equivalent of summoning which is a pet ronan
2007scape,not_removed,jagex policy is u have to live in uk to work their or something dumbest idea ever for time zones
2007scape,not_removed,almost like they probably have to work in jagex offices how weird and dumb is that ive never heard of such a thing
2007scape,not_removed,someone hasnt taken business
2007scape,not_removed,making cannonballs is a couple minutes per inventory
2007scape,not_removed,afk cooking raw sharks to cooked sharks is profitable at a certain level herb runs and timing it obviously fishing sharksmonkfishlobsswordfishtuna
2007scape,not_removed,fishing cooking woodcutting cannonballs are your best bet smithing dart tips good too if you ever plan on doing morytania elite diary i recommend doing barn fishing while doing hw
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i do it all the time ive gotten fishing woodcutting and magic afking while studying or editting magic is xphr if you string jewelry on the lunar spellbook its no profit at all but the cost is minimum wc at redwoods is xphr with barely any input and fishing is probably sticking at afking monkfish with about xphr
2007scape,not_removed,the most efficient thing to do would be melee training in nmz but all of the aforementioned methods are good too
2007scape,not_removed,you can afk train combat at bandits at defence with barrows armor i only click once every minutes sorry didnt read non combat ignore me
2007scape,not_removed,get cooking it takes like hours and you never burn shit its pure profit dark crabs karambwans and sharks are all good and its pretty afk
2007scape,not_removed,minimum loss w string jewellery what are you stringing gold amulets
2007scape,not_removed,ive been stringing gold ammys for days and gained around exp the loss is around per ammys
2007scape,not_removed,yes mainly gold amulets u and i did about holy symbols but they sell and buy pretty poorly
2007scape,not_removed,its not that bad then ty

2007scape,not_removed,seriousfuckingly holy shit
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,no that was is unload
2007scape,not_removed,when you try to be funny but youre not
2007scape,not_removed,yeah he and ronan managed to get pregnant after trying for months
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,archie does not have a son
2007scape,not_removed,you mean sick nerd
2007scape,not_removed,ronan
2007scape,not_removed,nephew
2007scape,not_removed,can someone please explain this meme i honestly dont think i can search this at work
2007scape,not_removed,insert at least you tried meme
2007scape,not_removed,youre not very bright are you
2007scape,not_removed,say it out loud with a british accent until you get it
2007scape,not_removed,apparently its fun to meme about a year old eating cum but what do i know
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i got that far but aside from tricking the steamer i also saw the mod mentioning it what is the origin of the joke
2007scape,not_removed,i dont understand what else is there to meme about
2007scape,not_removed,the streamer that they trucked to say it actually previously mentioned eating his own spunk casually on stream and acted as if this was sort of a normal thing to do sparked a debate between those who have and normal people and created this meme where nobody lets him live it down
2007scape,not_removed,are there any advantages to using teamviewer im just using rdp because im familiar with it and already have everything set up anyways i didnt purchase a vps just to do this
2007scape,not_removed,last i heard jumping cursors were a trigger for macro bans if youre on an android phone it might be worth looking into gnuroot runescape which is available on the app store
2007scape,not_removed,oh cool was thinking of info of like months ago cheers for the clarification
2007scape,not_removed,thanks this pretty much confirms everything i needed to know assuming that teamviewer on mobile uses touch input and not cursor dragging which wouldnt be that great for alching im guessing
2007scape,not_removed,and i cant get a rune scim
2007scape,not_removed,i started killing this guy to get my final odium shard got the pet on kill now and still havent got the shard
2007scape,not_removed,i got pet on
2007scape,not_removed,this shit community already hates everyone they pick on irons more because of their badge and target them out as special snowflakes
2007scape,not_removed,because they are jealous that they cant say i am an ironman to trigger other people
2007scape,not_removed,why do you care yo play the game
2007scape,not_removed,its in reaction to the prick ironman who think theyre special because theyre ironmen
2007scape,not_removed,this is a mmo
2007scape,not_removed,never noticed people hating on iron men etc unless theres iron men acting like they deserve a spot or youre doing something wrong for competing with them for a spot
2007scape,not_removed,because they think theyre entitled to special treatment to make their lives easier even though they chose this life
2007scape,not_removed,it takes a special kind of stupid to hate on someone for a badge
2007scape,not_removed,cause butthurt players bitch n moan at me
2007scape,not_removed,same thing happens to me but i ignore it because of the people on the internet have some stupid fucking topic that they bitch about if someone is saying something retarded i choose to pay attention to something else players acting stupid only effects me if they do things that are annoying such as wasting barricades in castlewars or ragging in pvp same thing in any other multiplayer game really if a player is annoying in the chat i dont care i might just mute them but if they are annoying to play with i leave and join other players
2007scape,not_removed,and how does that effect you
2007scape,not_removed,world has awesome drop parties
2007scape,not_removed,which is why ballista should have requirement to use it
2007scape,not_removed,sadly mage suggestions arent taken seriously at all unless its a gimmick to item sink for something else trident or gems balanced ko options for mage would be easy to implement without any developer or qa time at all for one if they simply allowed a pvp trident with a reduced casting speed of tick same spell cast as any other spell that would gives mages a ko option in using venge they would sacrifice both teleblock and freezing to make up for this for ancient magicks all theyd have to do is make ice and shadow barrage instant cast like they used to be in this would allow mages to combo off the ancient spellbook for ko potential its also a high skill cap to pull off consistently unlike gmaul combos ancient magick ko potential is balanced around not having access to tele block
2007scape,not_removed,hp requirements could be a thing like zenyte say if a mage spec weapon came out if it required magic making it also require hp would also mean that accounts lowest combat level would be
2007scape,not_removed,a player with just str and attack with combat is cmb hp ftfy
2007scape,not_removed,i never understood why only a few ranged weapons require attack levels to equip i feel like it would add an interesting addition and allow for a more rewardingbalanced range dps it would add another level to pk account building which would shake it up and keep it fresh as well
2007scape,not_removed,also the primary form of combat in pking is generally ranged until you can stand outside of the range for melee weapons and be safe if you are in the range you should be prepared ranged doesnt work like that i really liked the suggestion of giving the ballista a minimum range which would give it a similar mechanic to melee as a ko weapon ie watch your positioning players can outplay melee ko with positioning you cannot do that with ranged ko weapons its a ballista for christs sake its a super long range weapon to begin with
2007scape,not_removed,are you trump because thats a mighty fine wall you built
2007scape,not_removed,god bless polypore and storm of armadyl pking not so much the latter
2007scape,not_removed,hey he can still do the tongue thing though
2007scape,not_removed,its actually kinda sad watching this guy like i feel so bad for him could anyone fill me in on what happened to him will he recover
2007scape,not_removed,put the person before the disability please
2007scape,not_removed,how does he move his mouse seems mouse keyish movement
2007scape,not_removed,seeing an immobile guy getting paid to afk black demons makes me really uncomfortable for some reason
2007scape,not_removed,what tongue thing homie
2007scape,not_removed,he has a muscular disease that i do not know much about he was a good sport about everything though ice poseidon hosted him and he went from viewers to over he is very satirical about his condition and is a fun guy to watch
2007scape,not_removed,not sure what you mean
2007scape,not_removed,something we learnt in education
2007scape,not_removed,the fact that hes crippled was part of the humor
2007scape,not_removed,moves a device with his tounge i think
2007scape,not_removed,streamer that is crippled
2007scape,not_removed,ive never thought of it like that before thanks
2007scape,not_removed,i kinda want to know how some of these accounts are getting my name previously its only happened if i went to ge on a populated world id get a few but recently id be off doing slayer in a total world and get a few of those sorts of accounts spamming me all of a sudden
2007scape,not_removed,yea ive got heaps on my ignore aswell
2007scape,not_removed,thats an awful loot you got in a week
2007scape,not_removed,i just do clear history because they rarely send a message twice from the same account i really wish jagex would do something about this
2007scape,not_removed,its a private message bot that messages every player in the world
2007scape,not_removed,loot
2007scape,not_removed,thats like what people i filled the limit on my skiller in a week a while ago
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,ive sometimes gotten several messages from the same accs but the reason u might not get several messages from same acc is that they might get muted and then they just abandon the account
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think this is it im a level with shit stats and i still get this cancerous bullshit
2007scape,not_removed,really im a ironman and these guys still message me
2007scape,not_removed,i get them all the time at the fishing guild on my iron man it could be some free bots that unbeknownst to their users also collect the usernames of people around them and givesell those to gold selling sites
2007scape,not_removed,right click on any pm
2007scape,not_removed,lol for reals
2007scape,not_removed,do you never go to ge
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,no way
2007scape,not_removed,nope
2007scape,not_removed,some merchers and scammers did
2007scape,not_removed,is usually junk items with wrong ge price
2007scape,not_removed,step one you put up in trade window step two they put up of junk items in trade window step three they accept trade and you dont even think about it also accept step four scammer wins never let the scammer win
2007scape,not_removed,ohhh i understand now

2007scape,not_removed,you can modify it says how on the site
2007scape,not_removed,on another note in the ahk post they stated that you could not longer use ahk unless it was for remapping keys
2007scape,not_removed,yeah simply remapping keys is okay whether you do it with ahk or with mousekeyboard software just make sure its
2007scape,not_removed,why is this asked every single day
2007scape,not_removed,one to is not
2007scape,not_removed,oh its the nerd that makes pk vids never heard of him
2007scape,not_removed,so remapping keys is ok edit im asking because my clan said its not and it kinda freaked me out
2007scape,not_removed,sorry took forever to find this youre welcome it clearly states you can only use them to remap keys
2007scape,not_removed,no you can remap your keys through your keyboard only and only use windows mousekeys
2007scape,not_removed,thank you
2007scape,not_removed,now that im rereading the post it seems ambiguous on whether or not you can remap keys tbh id tweet them tbh

2007scape,not_removed,love that comment throws house on its side
2007scape,not_removed,a shitty multi pker makes a pking vid
2007scape,not_removed,not bannable just highly highly recommended against the other person can easily bot on the account hack it and steal your stuff recover the account and get it locked the list goes on and on
2007scape,not_removed,id be down to do whatever u want right now im just killing wyverns so i really need something to do
2007scape,not_removed,id be down for that whats your ign
2007scape,not_removed,it is only banable if its obvious or if you are interfering with competative side of runespace such as hiscores or dmm
2007scape,not_removed,officially its bannable in reality unless its an account being rented for money max main stakers odds stakers etc rent for phr or equivalent is really the only place i see this it seems to be okay to do assuming the ownership isnt contested if an account is shared and it ends up with people fighting over it itll just get locked
2007scape,not_removed,yeah it i thought about those situationsits just one of the things i want to do with a trust worthy person like a friend but most of mine dont play rs anymore or are just distracted with their own alts or other games thanks for the warning though
2007scape,not_removed,officially its bannable source on this jagex are pretty tight with rules when it comes to it and they have only banned people who were sharing in dmm tourney people have been sharing on os for as long as i can remember
2007scape,not_removed,i see so it would just come down to the two people who are using hmmwell i wouldnt fight over it if the partner decides to keep it i wouldnt argue with it this is just something i would like to do on the side
2007scape,not_removed,their rules page
2007scape,not_removed,you have firelighters ya dickhead
2007scape,not_removed,love how it says you have earned in the chat box
2007scape,not_removed,oh hah jeesh how didnt i notice that
2007scape,not_removed,no problem it happens to everyone at least once
2007scape,not_removed,ಠಠ
2007scape,not_removed,overcrowding is a bit of an issue id like to solo it for fun but it is too packed to bother one idea a friend had was solo only instances similar to kbd it could work since soloing isnt as efficient as teams but there is still the normal instance problems hopefully the new worlds well be getting soon could help with it
2007scape,not_removed,the only way rs can really have instanced bosses worth doing that dont ruin prices is to have them be a incredibly hard which will ignite a rich get richer i shouldnt need to be elite to have fun response or b make the drops incredibly rare which will cause zulrah spoiled players to say its not worth it i dont wanna have to invest xyz time to see profit so basically nothing will have changed if bandos for example were to be instanced prices would adjust so that it is only really lucrative for maxed players getting a high of kills per hour and you would once again be complaining
2007scape,not_removed,regarding you just need to compete against other players since its an mmo runescape is one of the only mmos where this is even a thing hopping and getting crashed is also pretty much universally hated even if youre the one crashing it doesnt feel good imo
2007scape,not_removed,id rather have a chance to get bandos armor on my ironman if instance can help with that im for it
2007scape,not_removed,problem is with bandos you can get pretty large kill streaks its not as efficient but you can still last for a long time if you prayer flick the minions
2007scape,not_removed,overcrowding is an issue because riskfree pvm made bossing safe and therefore appealing to growing population we might see an improvement with fairly penalized deaths so people can still focus on not dying as well as not losing item like the old system
2007scape,not_removed,in games like wow instancing works because dropped gear is bound to your character amount of items obtained in runescape directly affects the economy
2007scape,not_removed,yup but the same can be said for most bosses for skilled players the big factors of a private instances are cost and death even the best players occasionally die in solo so something would need to be done about items lost there
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,you probably mean utotttys client but he sold out to some company whoever he sold out to is still making it but itll be out in a month or so oh and the best place to get caught up on updates is here
2007scape,not_removed,uchrisleanbow
2007scape,not_removed,thanks man
2007scape,not_removed,are there any screens of that client
2007scape,not_removed,he pretty much deleted all screenshots of the client since he got bought out but there is a vod still
2007scape,not_removed,when you looked up instead of before duel arena changes and got bodied

2007scape,not_removed,iililillli the most fearsome opponent
2007scape,not_removed,never look a gifted horse in the mouth
2007scape,not_removed,k how rare is this thing i spent a week doing this
2007scape,not_removed,just use one at a time and use the remaining money to purchase gear its a lot easier to train teleport and skill with when i was level i had the one goal of trying all the skills to see if i enjoy anything the best way to get started though is do as many quests as you can it gives you some early experience which can be quite tedious you also unlock cool rewards and teleports etc if you get boredtired of quests go practice a members skill until you feel like questing again
2007scape,not_removed,when you use a bond make sure you earn enough for at least one more bond asap and keep that money to the side for a brand new player digging saltpetre on zeah takes reqs and can earn you around a few hours of that then you have your next bond banked and you can enjoy the game for the rest of your bond
2007scape,not_removed,thank you for the reply also do you know if making cannonballs are good money i was looking up videos on it and was wondering if its good i want to try to make money so i can keep buying bonds
2007scape,not_removed,i would suggest getting your farming up in it takes a little time at the start but after days you can start farming herb that will yield you a nice profit every farm run im sure that farming herbs will make you more then enough profit to keep buing bonds opinion plz
2007scape,not_removed,yes they are and also give smithing experience
2007scape,not_removed,sure is only takes a couple of minutes too
2007scape,not_removed,umodkieren
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for taking the time to put this together mr aby well need to check these against our records before we can change anything but if these are being used to scam and there is no other impact of changing the prices then i am happy to do it ill get our antiscam specialist to take a look at it one way to solve this is to allow the ge to update more regularly however that does open the door for the ge to be manipulated so an occasional manual change might be preferable it would be interesting to know the communitys thoughts ps yes there is an antiscam specialist who targets major scamming in both and osrs he regularly helps us adjust content to remove the chance of scamming occurring as well as banning the most prolific of scammers
2007scape,not_removed,the new mystic versions of staves such as mystic dust staff is in the ge but is actually
2007scape,not_removed,oh man the guy that paid for a bucket helm must feel like shit
2007scape,not_removed,thanks will try it out
2007scape,not_removed,why havent the jmods fixed this its been like months already for some of the clue scroll items
2007scape,not_removed,ge prices update way too slowly
2007scape,not_removed,tldrhttpsrsbuddycomexchange helpful tool which helps you know the actual prices of items at your fingertips even if you dont have osb installed
2007scape,not_removed,lmao so essentially almost every new master clue item pretty silly update imo
2007scape,not_removed,just a heads up it cant be traded on the ge but prenature amulets are expensive and have zero worth also this is excellent good job
2007scape,not_removed,maby put the zenyte items on the list also zenyte amulet ge price real price zenyte bracelet ge price real price zenyte neckalce ge price real price zenyte ring ge price real price uncut zenyte ge price real price zenyte cut ge price real price the prices of the cut and uncut zenyte i cant realy tell i think its about ish maby some one els knows it but the zenyte items are mostly used at the duell arena to scam with staking there is a diffrence of olmost each item its insane tbh
2007scape,not_removed,add empty oil lanterns somebody got me with those in bulk cant remember exactly but ge prices had of them at when altogether they sold for only about
2007scape,not_removed,mith grapple tip actual
2007scape,not_removed,how amazing would it be if a mod manually changed all these ge prices like they did on before they opened the well last year
2007scape,not_removed,just curioushow did you determine the actual prices
2007scape,not_removed,team cape
2007scape,not_removed,awesome list but can i ask why or how the ge prices get so fucked up
2007scape,not_removed,i would like to thank you for making this list i see youve seen my reply to the other thread p there are quite a lot of unfinished items that also qualify as being overpriced and thus could be used as scam items but is the only one i know that someone tried to scam with a couple of months back
2007scape,not_removed,there is a item called iron hastap which are like in ge but sell for like dont have the exact price but other hasta prices are inflated also
2007scape,not_removed,also the rock hammer that tricks people into thinking they buy a gmaul
2007scape,not_removed,also slayers respite keg seen that used a few times ge price is around but its only ever sold for like or under
2007scape,not_removed,pat yourself on the back op
2007scape,not_removed,blacksmiths helm is a scam item too ge real got one from a clue recently rip
2007scape,not_removed,definitely a solid list but the items with a small marginal difference i wouldnt necessarily consider scam items things such as the godsword ornamental kits theres just not a lot of these in game and players dont constantly have offers in for them
2007scape,not_removed,this needs to be addresed asap
2007scape,not_removed,some of these are far too close to their ge price to be considered legitimate scam items ie vs that wouldnt be a terribly uncommon level of fluctuation to see in other items and i doubt anyone looking to scam would choose an item thats not even worth more than what the ge lists it as
2007scape,not_removed,odium shard official ge price is i sold mine for mil somehow on ge osbuddy said that was the actively traded price
2007scape,not_removed,aaaand everyones trying to scam now
2007scape,not_removed,black brutal arrows in ge street
2007scape,not_removed,well someone tried to offer me a incomplete heavy ballista and a whip for my fury and dragon boots i declined and felt bad cause i thought it was worth the i dont feel bad anymore thanks op
2007scape,not_removed,this doesnt mean you should just buy whatever someone offers you for cheap in the ge useless list lol
2007scape,not_removed,i would remove this if i were you ik you mean well but this will only do more harm than good contrary to what it seems a majority of osrs players dont actually use reddit so this will just allow people to use any or all of these items to their advantage against the poor souls that will never see this post to be aware
2007scape,not_removed,they wont fix it because they dont care
2007scape,not_removed,osrs doesnt have summoning though
2007scape,not_removed,i think these cases are isolated and infrequent enough that manually going in and updating severely outofdateinaccurate prices is sufficient assuming its actually done automating it would likely introduce other problems edit maybe for new items dont even set a ge market price let players trade it for whatever they like without influence or expectations of arbitrary initial market prices then manually apply the market price once the new items price shows signs of stabilizing
2007scape,not_removed,thank you very much for taking a look into it these items are used to scam newer players mostly because they arent familiar with prices yet so i hope a solution can be found sooner rather than later also if i see players selling these items for prices that theyre not worth am i able to report them for scamming
2007scape,not_removed,if theres an antiscam specialist working for jagex hes been doing a pretty bad job so far many of these scam items have been used for months
2007scape,not_removed,i think just manually changing these items is the simplest way forward and when introducing new items eg clue cosmetics in the future maybe set the price a little lower and keep an eye on it
2007scape,not_removed,thanks dad matk
2007scape,not_removed,i know two people already ingame that have been doing this for atleast a week he showed me in items and said on a good day he could make alot of people are falling for this
2007scape,not_removed,based ujagexsween
2007scape,not_removed,can you explain why you guys cant remove the floor limit for updating the ge prices if the street price is significantly lower than the ge price it makes sense to have the ceiling price restricted by to prevent manipulation it makes no sense for the floor to be restricted by as i cannot see how someone can manipulate the prices in their favour by crashing the prices
2007scape,not_removed,mmk these scammers are rampant esp in they have bank sales containing some of these items at greatly inflated prices and try to buy expensive items off people using these items that have low street value and high ge value unaware players fall for this all the time
2007scape,not_removed,awesome
2007scape,not_removed,can you let me know when theres going to be an antiscam specialist job vacancy shit sounds whack
2007scape,not_removed,ps yes there is an antiscam specialist who targets major scamming in both and osrs he regularly helps us adjust content to remove the chance of scamming occurring as well as banning the most prolific of scammers no offence but go to ge on world and and you will see hes not doing the best of jobs that or you may need more than one antiscam specialist in the team
2007scape,not_removed,dont change it
2007scape,not_removed,theres been tons of these a simple google search result would have shown that
2007scape,not_removed,good job on this got scammed your antiscam specialist sure is doing work
2007scape,not_removed,i was just scammed i knew i shouldnt have done it greater demon mask jungle demon mask and gloves of darkness why is the ge price so much different than the actual value i just lost all of my money
2007scape,not_removed,we dont even need the ge to update more often necessarily even a one off price adjustment every months would be good enough for us the reddit player base is even wiling to make the lists this is like the time somebody has compiled a list like this and nothing has been done about it
2007scape,not_removed,the best thing to do would be to manually change these items there is no reason not to do it you guys changed items kept on death to be based on ge value to stop scamming but that does nothing unless you fix these prices and not to mention scamming in trade this is one of those i really cant believe it hasnt been fixed kind of things
2007scape,not_removed,antiscam specialist lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for reminding me it seems the dust one has leveled out on its own oddly enough
2007scape,not_removed,i used those last night to scam a level
2007scape,not_removed,so basically every mod of ours lol
2007scape,not_removed,usually he does it if the pricing is a difference of the ge pricing so if an item was worth say starting price but its selling for over constantly hed fix that but if it was say selling for like or constantly he would not change a thing
2007scape,not_removed,they update fine its just these items arent tradedso they dont update unless they have been traded
2007scape,not_removed,i hope osb and other clients can team up for that feature it would help everyone if konduit and runeloader also shared their data
2007scape,not_removed,wow thanks a ton that looks way better than what i did
2007scape,not_removed,yes this is a very good point prenature amulets are equivalent to the an enchanted emerald amulet
2007scape,not_removed,yes thank you for reminding me of this i forgot somehow
2007scape,not_removed,ive definitely paid over for them rushing to get back to arma during ddoss lol
2007scape,not_removed,i checked osbuddys actively traded prices and rounded up or down slightly
2007scape,not_removed,i will remove this it was low last night and i wasnt sure about it ive left some items out similar to this on purpose
2007scape,not_removed,when new items are released theyre given values set by jmods as to what they think they should be worth around on the ge unfortunately most of the time these prices are highly inaccurate and the items will crash extremely steeply within the first few weeks of said items being released the ge automatically updates its prices very slowly as to prevent merching i assume anyway and thus you get item prices appearing to be far above what they actually should be
2007scape,not_removed,the prices are just a guess by the mods of what the real prices would reflect when new items are released they put them high so that overtime the prices can level out this is because they dont want items to be sold for too low on release
2007scape,not_removed,ill add it right now thanks for the contribution p
2007scape,not_removed,np p hopefully the prices are adjusted soon so no one can fall for this stuff again
2007scape,not_removed,just pay a fair price dont come here for advice on scamming
2007scape,not_removed,a vast majority of the items listed here are already being used to scam with so naming them out doesnt really change much also the point of this post was not only to raise awareness but because someone had mentioned in a thread earlier that one of the mods said on a q a stream that if someone made a list of all the scam items they would go and adjust them to the appropriate prices
2007scape,not_removed,you must be new here the osrs mods specifically take weekly questions from reddit frequent reddit and even go so far as to shitpost on reddit safe to say they will see this and will be able to better adjust item prices the people scamming wont stop scamming and its better if a few more people learn this info and have it fixed up rather than let scamming continue
2007scape,not_removed,im sure that they do care they just have a lot of things on their plate theyve been working very hard on raids so maybe this list could make it easier for them to fix the prices with their tight schedule
2007scape,not_removed,oh how i miss my summoning tank
2007scape,not_removed,you just know that eh
2007scape,not_removed,you edited your post from cant to can because you got downvoted jesus
2007scape,not_removed,they can they have done it before
2007scape,not_removed,yep please do
2007scape,not_removed,but wait how is that scaming in other games ive always been told my item my price so if i wanted to sell a item for i could nobody has to buy it and its not necessarily scamming if im allowed to do my own price especially since i could just list it on the ah for whatever i want and potentially be the only one selling it
2007scape,not_removed,hes not specific to osrs
2007scape,not_removed,no need to be elitist about it after helped us out
2007scape,not_removed,or not even close
2007scape,not_removed,the bonus is that god ash is also the best troll ive ever seen
2007scape,not_removed,runeloader sure matthew is still salty that konduit matches osb as a client now there is no way in hell they will let that happen
2007scape,not_removed,just as an fyi if you want to make your post looking like that just click the source button then copy it and edit your post and just paste it in
2007scape,not_removed,also spider on shaft and spider on stick
2007scape,not_removed,i wish more people understood that
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah if summoning came to id start a summoning tank on day
2007scape,not_removed,buying crims ea
2007scape,not_removed,what did it say
2007scape,not_removed,that would take forever for items that end up being incredibly high valued
2007scape,not_removed,thats all good until some lucky noob gets a new item after a big update and runs and puts it in the ge for gp and it instasells for that when its actually worth
2007scape,not_removed,will do
2007scape,not_removed,what if a player is genuinely unaware of the correct prices and are just following the stated ge prices i can imagine many innocent players being banned because of this
2007scape,not_removed,to play devils advocate it cant technically be seen as scamming if the ingame price check says its worth much more than what they actually sell for on ge in my eyes its a scam ofc but some newer played who somehow obtained it shouldnt be seen as a scammer due to the ingames prices being outdated after all when judging someone by the rules you should assume they only have access to what you provide in the regular jagex client udraanexle is a ge scammer
2007scape,not_removed,this coming awfully close to blurring the line between merching and scamming
2007scape,not_removed,sooo
2007scape,not_removed,i dont see how thats elitist hes just saying that all the jmods use reddit thats not even nessecarily a good thing
2007scape,not_removed,i see no source button
2007scape,not_removed,my friend ruined mine but then happened and it didnt matter anyway
2007scape,not_removed,this isnt the same ge though the backup they used to make osrs was to before it
2007scape,not_removed,his original post said jmods cant edit ge prices he then got downvotes and without stating that he changed it made it to jmods can edit ge prices
2007scape,not_removed,even something worth would take at least a month
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt happen the number of wealthy players rushing to be the one to buy the first one in the game would virtually ensure the price will likely settle at or above the fair market value of the item
2007scape,not_removed,its unlikely they would just sell them on the ge the only reason to trade them instead is because you know nobody is buying them at ge price
2007scape,not_removed,then they would use the ge to sell it in most cases wouldnt they most people do but even if the vast majority of sales would be scammers they can tell the difference based on accounts past actions so i dont think innocent players will be affected
2007scape,not_removed,they probably lying only punish people with a pattern of scamming rather than just selling one item
2007scape,not_removed,its scamming because they know full well the value of the items thats why they dont sell it on the ge in the first place because they cant get the fake inflated price from it on there
2007scape,not_removed,damn i forgot thats an res feature only well if you download res reddit enhancement suite then you could do it sorry nvm you did it good job
2007scape,not_removed,hes referring to the small population of people that dont know the true value lets say youre a new player that fell for this scam and bought a house hood for example you spent your entire bank on this hood thinking you might be able to sell it for a little more on the ge you put it in and it wont sell for what you expected and you arent willing to keep lowering the price because youd take a loss so you resort to trying to sell it for lower outside the ge in your eyes is this player guilty of scamming i would say not this person is a victim of a scam and is trying to mitigate damage to his bank you cant be so quick to judge each person now of course the vast majority are knowingly attempting to scam but we cant assume all are scammers its the whole innocent until proven guilty idea many people buy into
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,they did recreate the ge
2007scape,not_removed,in that case you take the l and you learn from your mistake
2007scape,not_removed,the thing is those scammers do not directly try to sell the item instead they do things like selling junk worth for en then throw in a lot of the items listed above its highly obvious that theyre scamming
2007scape,not_removed,mistake trying to merch with your entire cash stack this is good life advice better learned on rs than with real money
2007scape,not_removed,no its not the innocent players who dont know about the issue who who are scamming rightly fuck off with your novelty account
2007scape,not_removed,but new players dont know theyve been scammed sometimes because they have no way to know the price is lower than the ge states
2007scape,not_removed,it was in the implings inventory how do you carry around up to sets of dragon armor
2007scape,not_removed,how can i carry million individual coins
2007scape,not_removed,or a cannon lmao
2007scape,not_removed,of them even
2007scape,not_removed,or ana
2007scape,not_removed,timers subtle stall scams items you might not have seen occasional invisible glitches that are unknown to the larger community possible pid manipulation staking is never man
2007scape,not_removed,all my stats are i do not pk or anything on this account so all the wins and losses are from stakes vs maxed accounts
2007scape,not_removed,i dont understand why jagex doesnt change pid back to how it was last year or we people on twitch were saying you could get hasta def boost without having it on but idk i honestly love to pvm get some cash then go stake but it sucks when you feel like you are being cheated i have a big enough sample size to even prove something is messed up not to mention a lot of those fights the people are going to have rest and stuff
2007scape,not_removed,i just got my win today however i have losses can anyone please explain this to me lossing of the time there is nothing untoward about these numbers barring you making mistakes being outplayed scammed etc just because it is an essentially roll it does not mean everyone is going to have equal wins and losses that is the entire point of gambling some people win and some people lose
2007scape,not_removed,staking maxed is near but it never actually is exactly standard deviation aside as soon as you face someone with a different pid than yourself obv every duel the odds are going to change the pid change was suppose to take the player side manipulation away from dueling but that doesnt mean that it made pid absolutely fair without seeing the code ourselves we arent able to determine if pid is long term it could very well be that your account has faced more players with better pid or it could just be within standard deviation or a combination of the two duels is a very small sample size and they are only on one account i would be more comfortable looking at stats from separate accounts and seeing their average
2007scape,not_removed,i never mess up the rules and never miss the first hit tell me that isnt a good sample size and my numbers shouldnt be closer to even tho
2007scape,not_removed,i get what you are saying however with the new pid system it should be easier to manipulate pid use to change every game ticks or something right but now it changes every seconds the sample size is like fights so double the size
2007scape,not_removed,it isnt a good sample size mate go gather the total wins and losses of players who have a similar amount of games played and come back to be p that is simply how games of chance work you only have more losses than wins which isnt that statistically significant
2007scape,not_removed,is pretty big in something that supposed to be not to mention other people give me free pid and stats all the time
2007scape,not_removed,it might feel like it for you but it isnt when youre considering a sample size of tens of thousands
2007scape,not_removed,ok so lets the sample size thats my current rate would that be unlucky i am giving a constant performance all the time and im no where near close to even i statistically have an edge since other players do make mistakes vs me coin flip simulators dont even get off by over flips ever go try it
2007scape,not_removed,ok so lets the sample size thats my current rate would that be unlucky for you yes but if the entire sample size of all players worked out to be then there would be no issue i am giving a constant performance all the time and im no where near close to even i dont have any proof of that for all we know you fuck up regularly we dont even really know if staking is particularly with pid
2007scape,not_removed,how do i fuck up please explain i never miss hits i use flick or deflect switch if offset and i never get scammed bonuses i get free hits and stats vs people
2007scape,not_removed,dont bother lads stupid video trying to sell you insane profit buying dyes if perhaps only two or three people did for a couple hours a day it would crash the market and it will soon become insane an hour
2007scape,not_removed,repost
2007scape,not_removed,delet this
2007scape,not_removed,lol almost got killed by them when they were making this
2007scape,not_removed,i had this question asked on stream the answer was that the patch changes with each growth cycle so it would have to be changed to remain constant which is possible but something something spaghetti code
2007scape,not_removed,now this ladies and gentlemen is a good example of a quality of life improvement it doesnt changeadd anything massive in the game or impact exphour rates
2007scape,not_removed,or just left click inspect it ez
2007scape,not_removed,additionally a perlite pebble texture could be added to make it more distinguishable for colorblind players
2007scape,not_removed,devalues my colourblindness
2007scape,not_removed,think they said it wouldnt be possible with how the current farming system works you can just attempt to use supercompost on it again and it will tell you if its already been filled with supercompost
2007scape,not_removed,add qol to title
2007scape,not_removed,yes please although its still fairly hard to see the difference between the colours youve shown
2007scape,not_removed,we just need a chat message when using super compost and fertile soil spell on a farming patch
2007scape,not_removed,you should do infomercials with that excitement you have over dirt
2007scape,not_removed,lets be honest youre gonna inspect it regardless to make sure
2007scape,not_removed,you know if you inspect the patch it will tell you if youve used supercompost or not
2007scape,not_removed,engine work aka we are lazy
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,they should make the leprechaun turn into big gay al when its been treated with super compost
2007scape,not_removed,b e a u t i f u l please implement this teewhy
2007scape,not_removed,colour blind here there is no difference just fyi
2007scape,not_removed,that just makes my colourblind game harder
2007scape,not_removed,i cant even tell the difference if this is done it should be nearly black
2007scape,not_removed,theyve said they cant do this without a ton of work not really worth it
2007scape,not_removed,maybe there is a way to have it work independently from the farming cycle spaghetti code which i know none of the mods want to touch place a transparent plane over the farming patch create two flags that trigger the transparency of the plane whenever one of the following happens when supercompost is used when a patch is completely harvested or cleared if the first flag is triggered update the plane from being completely transparent to dark maroon with a alpha if the second flag triggers update the plane from dark maroon with alpha to being completely transparent placing a semitransparent dark maroon plane over the farming patch would make the color of the patch underneath appear richer and would be unnoticeable unless the player were to look at the patch from a low angle perhaps a hackish solution but if the farming patch texture is tied into the farming cycle code this seems like a good workaround to rewriting large sections of old source code
2007scape,not_removed,its funny because there is a lot of stuff jagex wontwouldnt touch because of bad code ape atoll comes to mind honestly instead of some big updates i wouldnt mind if they took months or so to fix some of the bigger messes of code or engine stuff that can be used later in updates it would be a good thing for the future as we wont be denied as many updates because bad code or whatnot
2007scape,not_removed,nnah compost dried out to give brighter colour again boom problem solved
2007scape,not_removed,yea this devalues patch clicking skills
2007scape,not_removed,this because i was looking at the image and was like which one is which xd
2007scape,not_removed,cant
2007scape,not_removed,of course but its slightly more convenient to glance at something to discern its state making a feature that feels intuitive is good from a design standpoint in any game
2007scape,not_removed,he said spaghetti spaghetti
2007scape,not_removed,ill only support if jagex publicly acknowledges that i got my farming before the update
2007scape,not_removed,i will shoot down anything that is a pointless waste of dev time
2007scape,not_removed,i thought they hired kieren to eat that all up
2007scape,not_removed,theyll grant you a skill eye patch for your troubles
2007scape,not_removed,kieren can only eat so much without getting morbidly obese
2007scape,not_removed,genius you connected by not like srsly get some intuition buster
2007scape,not_removed,if you want to change your name you can buy some bonds and change it
2007scape,not_removed,the fact you dont see how this is insensitive is concerning
2007scape,not_removed,if you pk you probably have aid off
2007scape,not_removed,insensitive is a word used only by safespace needing pussies if something offends you nothing really happens so what youre offended oh no fucking vegans
2007scape,not_removed,and youre the reason this subreddit is toxic
2007scape,not_removed,you ever go outside what happens if someone offends you you gonna call the police kill yourself how about have enough emotional stability to not give a fuck youre the reason emilys not banned yet
2007scape,not_removed,dont cut yourself on that edge bruv
2007scape,not_removed,she doesnt need to be banned move on child
2007scape,not_removed,he was afk he died he returned he flamed he delured also what is the imc blacklist
2007scape,not_removed,um no lol i was afk came back to hp then you purposely lured a shaman on me to kill me then started flaming me first and ironmen in general good one lol xox
2007scape,not_removed,theres an unsafe zone just southeast of the varrock castle where suiciders can attack you its just north of varrock square
2007scape,not_removed,there it is literally where i died
2007scape,not_removed,i can see that being unsafe now but i couldnt attack back thats lame
2007scape,not_removed,quality meme
2007scape,not_removed,you tried
2007scape,not_removed,how is this even remotely osrs related rule
2007scape,not_removed,cos of mod reach
2007scape,not_removed,that doesnt even work on osrs anymore here is my problems its a picture of a toothbrush not an audi even if its blue as an audi its still isnt an audi mod reach dont work for osrs anymore these kind off jokes is year old only year olds does this kind of joke its still a toothbrush as far i know osrs doesnt even have toothbrushes in the game audi blue or toothbrushes arent related to osrs while audis might be related to mod reach mod reach isnt related to osrs since he got fired a looong time ago zeah is too big would you be happy if i would post everything in real life on this subreddit just because its blue not even funny if anything breaking rule i dont have reasons but i do have this is not oldschool runescape
2007scape,not_removed,okaay
2007scape,not_removed,are you triggered you seem triggered
2007scape,not_removed,¯ツ¯
2007scape,not_removed,maybe both but i did encounter a ton of bots i think its mostly a bot problem because i didnt see that many legit players most of the time it was a bot
2007scape,not_removed,skill total worlds and world are usually good
2007scape,not_removed,tons of bots
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for making a guide on the most ubiquitous and widely known money making method in the entire game
2007scape,not_removed,thats like dont complain
2007scape,not_removed,rip
2007scape,not_removed,cancerous youtube channel i hope u dont actually watch those videos
2007scape,not_removed,what if they just log out after the transaction
2007scape,not_removed,cancerous youtube channel i hope u dont actually watch those videos
2007scape,not_removed,im here to match your comment
2007scape,not_removed,redownload then come back to us
2007scape,not_removed,same thing mate
2007scape,not_removed,stop botting dumbass
2007scape,not_removed,if you could learn how to spell burnt shark youd probably figure this out
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know whether you botted or not but im bothered by the mindless servility of so many of the users on this site they seem to believe that jagex can do no wrong and that the system doesnt have flaws ive never been banned on any of my accounts but if you didnt bot i wish you all the best in fighting this there needs to be more transparency on jagexs part there have been documented cases of higher level players with thousands of hours invested into the game being banned on what turned out to be false positives see the case of unicef for example that alone is frightening enough
2007scape,not_removed,rip aaliyah rip
2007scape,not_removed,move on with your life stop being such a loser
2007scape,not_removed,quit posting the same thing every day gf dont bot next time
2007scape,not_removed,lul
2007scape,not_removed,thanks ill just keep on keeping on
2007scape,not_removed,the bots are ridiculous but i still play dmm and nature runes are each without them
2007scape,not_removed,if they dont have like someone dedicated to banning dmm bots it will be bad and even if they do that if they dont change the rules of altscape for this specific season it will still be too easy to get mage up
2007scape,not_removed,i dont mind the bots its just pretty rediculous that it is a guarded zone
2007scape,not_removed,are you making sure only can attack you at the same time you could also kill them
2007scape,not_removed,look up a guide on how to lure the healers preferably pot up sons guide
2007scape,not_removed,post your gearinventstats so we can see what were working with
2007scape,not_removed,get them stuck on a corner like youd do to any of the other monsters just a little tougher with the pray switching
2007scape,not_removed,how many brews and restores did u have at jadon average
2007scape,not_removed,my gear is proselytes ancient dhide ancient blessing blowpipe with rune darts archers ring i b gloves fury avas holy sandals stats range pray def hp
2007scape,not_removed,check out pot up sons fire cape guides super helpful for where to go and how to lure jad beat the caves on my first try thanks to his guidesd
2007scape,not_removed,kill the healers play sounds for jad range doesnt make a sound til it hits and mage makes a sound when its fired
2007scape,not_removed,the best thing to do is to just keep on trying once you get the flow its with you for life
2007scape,not_removed,i did my first kill first time by following mr mammals guide on it jad spawns where the orange on wave spawns if its behind a rock you can relax if not turn sounds on and wait to hear what to pray first always focus on jads attack and lure healers away from jad
2007scape,not_removed,let me reveal a simple trick that makes jad a piece of cake for your first try the place where jad spawns is the same place as where the melee mob spawns on wave so you can fix the jad spawn to a simple one like behind the italy rock making it easy to lure the healers away and kill them once they spawn
2007scape,not_removed,if you can get him here then out of the healers will be trapped once you aggro them the fourth the one that comes from the west will get to you but you can just kill him but make sure to pay attention to jads attacks while you do just did this with level defence low hp and bad gear and you can tank one easily while you kill it edit the closer you get jad to that northern rock edge the better because the western healer will probably get trapped as well
2007scape,not_removed,kill them one by one and stay focussed on jad take priority and switching protection prayers
2007scape,not_removed,use blowpipe dragon darts higher range level line them up so you only have to tank steel skin if all else fails kill them
2007scape,not_removed,but what if the orange mager spawns to shitty spot
2007scape,not_removed,so i have to log out
2007scape,not_removed,i had full bottles of both when i reached jad
2007scape,not_removed,i know all that shit ill try to kill them next time
2007scape,not_removed,easy to do it with addy dragon darts are a bit overkill unless youre a billionaire imo jad is easy enough to kill with rcb provided you have the skillknowledge to kill him at all
2007scape,not_removed,did all of those expect
2007scape,not_removed,adamant darts are fine the range level is also fine blowpipe is op at fight caves just kill them by and stay focussed on jad
2007scape,not_removed,respawn caves til you get southsouth eastmiddle spawn and use pot up son guide
2007scape,not_removed,bring angler fish and karambwan if u think u can substatute that out for some restores
2007scape,not_removed,i dont care if its ez to do with addy darts since dragon darts are op and i am a billionaire i bring addy darts for caves and switch to dragon darts on the wave before jad i have gotten capes in the last few months
2007scape,not_removed,i bring sharks and karambwan to tick eat on jad if he hits me this way i dont have to brewrestorerange pot again
2007scape,not_removed,going to kill bots and record it when im not doing my hcim series anyone got any good bot locations i could go to
2007scape,not_removed,you have a valid point but remember this is for a golden gnome which is purely from the rs communitys opinion not twitchs its good he has lots of viewers that dont play rs but that doesnt make him more worthy of a golden gnome
2007scape,not_removed,fuck boaty
2007scape,not_removed,theres a google doc to vote
2007scape,not_removed,well its jagexs reward not twitchs
2007scape,not_removed,it wont count
2007scape,not_removed,mod archie confirmed it will
2007scape,not_removed,currently working towards slayer what other goals should i be going for
2007scape,not_removed,construction for house portals prayer and general skilling for quest cape its always good to do quests
2007scape,not_removed,magic could he helpful for other spells including lunars
2007scape,not_removed,agility
2007scape,not_removed,got the oak logs for but havent made into planks yet and only qp but slowly getting there i havent started the prayer grind is green drags best way to go about that thanks for the tips
2007scape,not_removed,ok ive got some unpowered orbs i should charge for air bstaffs and need to start doing barrows any other methods i should be doing thanks for the comment
2007scape,not_removed,on it thanks
2007scape,not_removed,with your stats i guess green dragons yea use the ectofuntus if you get agility tho maybe blue dragons p
2007scape,not_removed,ok thanks
2007scape,not_removed,puro puro seems to be a good place to check every hour
2007scape,not_removed,sparc macs cc has been pretty good to me d imp wise
2007scape,not_removed,let your fc know youre hunting one
2007scape,not_removed,lolol nice
2007scape,not_removed,that was pretty fun not gonna lie
2007scape,not_removed,a good time d
2007scape,not_removed,right was loads of fun d
2007scape,not_removed,very much so
2007scape,not_removed,idk if this will cheer you up but its one of the most common pets dont worry if that didnt help youll get another dw
2007scape,not_removed,poor snek
2007scape,not_removed,what are you listening to
2007scape,not_removed,i weep for you my friend
2007scape,not_removed,yet they laugh at me when i wear ring of life to bosses
2007scape,not_removed,you might have to change your rsn
2007scape,not_removed,youll get it again no one stops doing zulrah at under kc
2007scape,not_removed,lmao rip
2007scape,not_removed,welp
2007scape,not_removed,ur gear switch being on the right side is triggering me
2007scape,not_removed,why on earth does zulrah drop battle staves thats such a random and irrelevant drop that was clearly only put on the drop table bc people like battlestaves
2007scape,not_removed,i have zul kills no pet why
2007scape,not_removed,and if that doesnt cheer u up i have kc and no pet yet p
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,ak
2007scape,not_removed,i believe if you die before zulrah dies and you hit the outer on the drop table you will get the pet when you respawn in lumbridgefaladoredge
2007scape,not_removed,ring of life wouldnt have mattered it killed me with a on the same hit i killed it edit english r hard
2007scape,not_removed,you need recoil for zulrah its pretty important
2007scape,not_removed,deaths to zulrah are from unlucky range hits on blue phase andor snakelings in the same tick rol wont save you also like others said recoil is necessary
2007scape,not_removed,the rng is good just not the timing
2007scape,not_removed,its so demoralizing though ive gone back but every time i kill it the chat box makes me sad
2007scape,not_removed,is zulrah picking flax for hours on end much more believable for you
2007scape,not_removed,cus rng
2007scape,not_removed,well it is
2007scape,not_removed,the power of reddit downvote everything that is already downvoted
2007scape,not_removed,how can someone fall asleep listing to this lol
2007scape,not_removed,was hoping for something dirtiercreepierfreaky and sexual now i just feel ashamed for the things i listen to gg dud
2007scape,not_removed,that rough moment when waiting three eternities for bandos loot to appear then its a tassets then minions tick you to death some of us have been there ouch
2007scape,not_removed,eating that shark you had left though p
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt of
2007scape,not_removed,dont ruin his dreams
2007scape,not_removed,tbf it could be the stealing from llletya with its snakelings its to nerf bots anyway
2007scape,not_removed,well no thats stupid too
2007scape,not_removed,maybe flax grows underwater
2007scape,not_removed,extremely stupid wow lol really gotta flex you epeen there dont you excuse me for pointing out something with poor design in a game completely riddled with inconsistencies and poor design
2007scape,not_removed,but you get drops per kill so its kills
2007scape,not_removed,what the hell
2007scape,not_removed,reported
2007scape,not_removed,so much regret i clicked on it to tick eat it too just to be safe missclick
2007scape,not_removed,nice lisp idiot
2007scape,not_removed,it has a different drop table so its
2007scape,not_removed,thats not how it works thats not how it works at all oo
2007scape,not_removed,doesnt work like that and anyway you get drops
2007scape,not_removed,well youre not wrong
2007scape,not_removed,reported
2007scape,not_removed,i dont have a lisp
2007scape,not_removed,yh i know but ive seen alot of ppl who got it pre kc also kc at cerb and no pet yet but ah well also i wasnt whining lol like i dont expect to get a pet its just nice when it happens p
2007scape,not_removed,yes you do scott malkinson you also have diabetes
2007scape,not_removed,there are about as many people who get them in kills as in
2007scape,not_removed,too op
2007scape,not_removed,nope too op this would also ruin hybridtribrid fights
2007scape,not_removed,panic buy prayer pots
2007scape,not_removed,sorry my friend but this is level op
2007scape,not_removed,when i first clicked the image i panicked and thought this was part of the dev blog then i read the bottom and saw it was suggestion no not only would this break pvp it would make the best money maker in the game more afk than it already is zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,zulrah is definitely easy money but it is by no means afk
2007scape,not_removed,on rangemelee phases i can easily multitaskbrowse web on my other monitor i would say its more afk than things like mining or cooking most skills
2007scape,not_removed,how the hell is zulrah more afk than cooking
2007scape,not_removed,ive only ever gotten cooking with wines i forgot people do it the poor way
2007scape,not_removed,my favorite pet right there so jealous
2007scape,not_removed,link to his imgur httpimgurcomabbxcq
2007scape,not_removed,either you get it or you dont
2007scape,not_removed,youll stop being truly inconvenienced by them in the or early by the time you get stats in the and theyll actually feel good to see just as a quick break in the monotony
2007scape,not_removed,there are not
2007scape,not_removed,yo eat a dick lil nigga aint no one watching your bitch ass streams on the page anyways
2007scape,not_removed,yeah why isnt there a way to disable xp gains they totally screw up the whole game
2007scape,not_removed,so sorry your bots got interrupted and logged out phag
2007scape,not_removed,hm considering i livestream thats pretty funny to accuse me of that fuck off
2007scape,not_removed,look autumn elegys videos on youtube he go in all those details in depth
2007scape,not_removed,ty
2007scape,not_removed,do you think that by delaying the hit damage there will be more skill it seems to me that lining everything up takes a lot more skill than just hoping you hit big and following up with a spec years ago thats what the vast majority of people did and it seems modern pking requires far more skill
2007scape,not_removed,what lol this has to be a troll
2007scape,not_removed,players are able to kill each other if theyre not using prayers isnt this kind of like a good thing pvp would be worthless if nobody ever killed anyone
2007scape,not_removed,this has been around basically forever its a nonissue people have been doing this since long before xp drops were around only difference was an extra tab switch from the skill tab
2007scape,not_removed,still have exp drops but be able to lock out the exp maybe even have an item that is dropped from a boss or another that locks exp up to x ammount of exp
2007scape,not_removed,agree though low levels would be hp dark bow meta
2007scape,not_removed,id agree but allowing the atker to know when hes going to hit big before allowing the other player to know gives them the easy opportunity to stack the gmaul when they know their opponent will be low hp id rather gmaul speccing require reaction for it to be used skillfully
2007scape,not_removed,sorry i meant to say players are able to kill each other with no counter u cant out eat or tele out in between the max hp stack
2007scape,not_removed,thats a huge difference itself u cant have gmaul right clicked with spec ready so there is time for the other guy to react but there has never been a weapon like ballista before
2007scape,not_removed,not a big deal people are their combat will just start fighting in wild away from ditch and will pk them easily
2007scape,not_removed,then adjust the ballista not a mechanic that of the pvp community would be pissed to see go nbsp and moreover you said yourself that youre not a a pvper so what makes you think youre qualified to speak to whats right for pvp mechanics
2007scape,not_removed,lmao when did i say that im in a pvp clan even i pk everyday
2007scape,not_removed,odd perhaps i was thinking of another thread in any case theres nothing wrong with the mechanic and itll never be removed its too integral to the meta
2007scape,not_removed,its a minigame a couple cosmetics would fit well imo
2007scape,not_removed,i really agree with this post especially the cosmetics part there should be different cosmetics for kills rank wins
2007scape,not_removed,please no more cosmetics people want to play a pvp minigame for money and rewards not to dress up to be fair
2007scape,not_removed,the pray flick requirement is annoying at best even though i can do it in a very basic manner its stupid that pingconnectionabusing a game mechanic is the base foundation of the success in this mini game either remove overheads or give everyone a lot more so they can be successful without prayer flicking
2007scape,not_removed,yeh jagex really need to stop holding back on updates like this because some players could abuse it same thing happened on deadman blood money whats so fking hard about banning the people who abuse it and letting the real players have their fun
2007scape,not_removed,my reasons for not playing are prayer flicking i also find it super hard to use the store while in combat getting greifed ie people selling everything for monk fish running deep into fog lobby chat is annoying
2007scape,not_removed,i was scared to suggest rewards that actually do things
2007scape,not_removed,jesus why are you so negative what so wrong with more cosmetic it doesnt effect anybody in a bad way whatsoeverif you dont like cosmetic you can simply not use it then edit sorry if im coming at you in a harsh manner it just bother me reading those commentthis is a community after all one must not only think about himself also not everything has to be best in slot or best in xp for the game their players willing to invest time and that all that should matter if you ask me
2007scape,not_removed,what could you ban anyone for
2007scape,not_removed,thats fair i think making it more profitable without necessarily contributing to inflation is the way to go
2007scape,not_removed,i have an issue with the argument that people cant disagree with cosmetics because they can choose not to wear them it still has an effect on other players because they have to look at the stuff stupid cosmetics was one of the reasons i stopped playing ridiculous cosmetic items are rampant in that game and id rather osrs steer clear of them
2007scape,not_removed,not everything has to be best in slot or best in xp for the game nor does it have to have special recolors not everything needs to be able to have variations of color this is a medieval themed game recolors arent necessary i just pointed out lms players probably dont want it anyway
2007scape,not_removed,well for example you could ban people on deadman mode who were repeatedly killing their friends and visa versa for blood money similarly players who continuously log out on lms play with their friends or potentially scam any item rewards that come out could also just be very very easily perm banned couple of those and people would stop taking the piss
2007scape,not_removed,you snatched it from its home and stuffed it in your backpack
2007scape,not_removed,tbh probably you
2007scape,not_removed,i in case any of you were having trouble viewing it on mobile

2007scape,not_removed,good post
2007scape,not_removed,well theres the fact that ive been systematically killing his friends and family for the past million fishing xp
2007scape,not_removed,of course its fucking sad people catch it from the water then just drop it to the ground and let it die they dont even eat it wtf
2007scape,not_removed,might as well call it a weeping trout
2007scape,not_removed,and then dropped it too the floor
2007scape,not_removed,regards every kidnapped child
2007scape,not_removed,leaping trout p
2007scape,not_removed,honest question is it faster and more xphr to use a knife to cut the fish then drop the row or to just drop all the fish
2007scape,not_removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
2007scape,not_removed,unless ur using the roe to tick just drop them
2007scape,not_removed,having another use would possibly make the price of the tentacle go up potentially changing your per kill estimate i like the idea no doubt only thing that caught my eye was removing a tooth from the tentacle how did the tooth get there maybe i dont know enough about the kraken in all seriousness i do like the idea a lot
2007scape,not_removed,i dont totally get the whole toothpendent part but using tentacles on something that wakes the kraken seems like a good idea maybe some kind of horn or something you can attach tentacles to and blow to wake the kraken
2007scape,not_removed,but the whole point of this would be a tentactle sink which would cause the price to go up but still cant see this being used very often considering it would only get you a couple extra kills an hour
2007scape,not_removed,you think its cheap to pay instead of taking seconds longer to shoot bronze arrows
2007scape,not_removed,i think lore wise its more like taunting the kraken hey look at me im wearing part of your species that i killed similar to scalps
2007scape,not_removed,turn on sticky keys then press shift times and it will be held down until you release it
2007scape,not_removed,just use sticky keys lol
2007scape,not_removed,turn on on screen keyboard clicking the shift key on the on screen keyboard locks the shift key allowing you to just left click in order to drop your items enjoy mate
2007scape,not_removed,i dont see whats wrong with it honestly while youre technically not suppose to it would be the same as just holding ur finger on it they implemented this new system they had to figure people would find ways to keep shift enabled but you are doing all of the clicking on your own i dont see a problem with it
2007scape,not_removed,can you use sticky keys for shiftclick dropping just spam shift like times mad quick until it turns on
2007scape,not_removed,you can use sticky keys just hit your shift key times in a row press yes and now if you hit your shift key twice in a row it will lock it as if you were pressing it down
2007scape,not_removed,just use sticky keys its a windows function
2007scape,not_removed,lazy bollox cant even hold shift for secs fuck me you 🐳
2007scape,not_removed,for some reason it keeps turning off ill mess with it
2007scape,not_removed,exactly maybe we can get a staff come and confirm it
2007scape,not_removed,i power mine for hours lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,no summer time usually means free time you are not the target demographic if you think otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,and c cxxx h cuh cu u cup h cf b v
2007scape,not_removed,jäger
2007scape,not_removed,i actually did watch that when it was first released yeah
2007scape,not_removed,yep didnt believe some of it but i watched it
2007scape,not_removed,it seems as nearly people watched it so im gonna guess someone really watched it
2007scape,not_removed,mod ghostheavy breathing
2007scape,not_removed,glad to see people are still mad about the defender
2007scape,not_removed,this would actually be a great old school model in red tbh
2007scape,not_removed,at this point i cant tell if its a meme or if people actually care
2007scape,not_removed,reminder that theres a pink pixel in this image
2007scape,not_removed,this is pink
2007scape,not_removed,needs a green pixel
2007scape,not_removed,thats pretty rad dude
2007scape,not_removed,gurl thats camp
2007scape,not_removed,id wear it
2007scape,not_removed,why is it pink dragon armour is red is it not
2007scape,not_removed,ew
2007scape,not_removed,the design on the front makes it look like a tuxedo shirt
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,looks absolutely fabulous yes please
2007scape,not_removed,well theyre both dragon weapons armour so i think it fits fine thematically
2007scape,not_removed,model looks pretty sick
2007scape,not_removed,i actually just like the design lol
2007scape,not_removed,i want one
2007scape,not_removed,looks better tbh
2007scape,not_removed,bad meme you better feel bad
2007scape,not_removed,just as pink as purple partyhat
2007scape,not_removed,unlike the dragon defender this actually looks good in pink
2007scape,not_removed,i actually like this more than the dragon red red armour is not good i wanna see my enemies bleed
2007scape,not_removed,the dragon defender should be considered a fix and sgouldnt be polled xd
2007scape,not_removed,inspired by dragon defender kappa
2007scape,not_removed,ijust love how nobody complained up to the point they came up with the idea to poll a changetypical hype train reddit behavior
2007scape,not_removed,why cant i downvote this multiple times
2007scape,not_removed,unironically this it should have been red like every other dragon item
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,it literally ruins the game it has no right to continue having that glow and fucking ruins an otherwise flawless game i dont care how you voted but if you voted not to change it i hope you fucking die because you ruined the longevity and integrity of osrs
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,httpimgurcomfklkovu
2007scape,not_removed,would like to see it with arms just to compare but does look awesome
2007scape,not_removed,so exactly as it was in before the graphical update i didnt mind that design but id prefer something different and fresh seeing as it will be coming into the game in a new way i think a new look would be beneficial
2007scape,not_removed,both
2007scape,not_removed,no its ghost red
2007scape,not_removed,itll match the dragon defender
2007scape,not_removed,pretty red mod ghost
2007scape,not_removed,not anymore
2007scape,not_removed,looks red to me are you colorblind
2007scape,not_removed,yes because the devs came up with the idea to change it
2007scape,not_removed,its a joke man
2007scape,not_removed,its not a big deal if it werent for reddit i didnt even notice that it has a slight pinkish tint
2007scape,not_removed,voting no on a cosmetic change ruins the integrity and longevity of the game
2007scape,not_removed,yeah but it has to be low poly so it looks like it was actually made in i hate how much new gear like the serp helm clashes with the gear and textures
2007scape,not_removed,much great ms paint skills
2007scape,not_removed,alright thats clever damn you
2007scape,not_removed,ghost is that you
2007scape,not_removed,exactly if they wouldnt have mentioned people still wouldnt care
2007scape,not_removed,its just a prank bro
2007scape,not_removed,well some people complained about that glow on preview on stream when it came by that time it had glow and people said that dragon is not magical metal so it shouldnt have magical glow i dont renember did they complain about colour
2007scape,not_removed,once you know about it though you never unsee it
2007scape,not_removed,thats the joke yes
2007scape,not_removed,blame ghost
2007scape,not_removed,thing is the was made in right it still is low poly unlike serp or bludgeon
2007scape,not_removed,same d full helm is ugly
2007scape,not_removed,for them to mention it people did care enough for them to take notice
2007scape,not_removed,the way it was written doesnt seem sarcastic to me kinda hard to tell sometimes with text as opposed to spoken word
2007scape,not_removed,ghost
2007scape,not_removed,yeah the way the dplate looked like when it was released in was fine hell they dont even have to make a new way to get it i wouldnt mind if they just rehashed the way you got it in and add in the quest for it
2007scape,not_removed,it says in the wiki that it was released in july does it have a different model than it was when it was released in
2007scape,not_removed,yes sarcasm doesnt translate well through text but that was a ridiculous enough post that you should assume its sarcastic
2007scape,not_removed,i want wgs too but i doubt itll happen
2007scape,not_removed,no people just need something to complain about
2007scape,not_removed,oh ok then i dont see the problem it was made in you cant blame the developers of for making an item look good for its time new items are different because they dont look like items from with most gear in that wasnt in the actual you can clearly see that it was made or later because of the more modern graphics
2007scape,not_removed,it isnt though its old school runescape
2007scape,not_removed,whats this sub called again
2007scape,not_removed,this sub is community made
2007scape,not_removed,there is always that one guy correcting people with grammar names and spelling
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,adamant bolts turn into useful enchanted bolts rune bolts do not
2007scape,not_removed,how did i not know this and why lmao why dont rune bolts get turned into diamond bolts e and emerald bolts e are u sure
2007scape,not_removed,because runebolts have dragonstone onyx enchantments adamant has ruby and diamond probably also because broad bolts are as good as addy bolts less demand
2007scape,not_removed,just pay the and go to the island of people on there arent bots and there like spots and theres almost always a few worlds with open spots then just dont leave and hold your ground lol either that or get hunter and put box traps out on each crab xd
2007scape,not_removed,no also use the sand crabs spot near the farming place just east of it i think no ones ever there
2007scape,not_removed,whenever a bot tries to crash me i stay there and try and make all the sand crabs stay aggro to me when the bot notices it hasnt attacked anything in a while itll run away worst case scenario i crash an obvious bot and for some reason those dip out in a minute or less
2007scape,not_removed,sorry new to here what is this island for that you speak of and im level hunter d
2007scape,not_removed,well they werent
2007scape,not_removed,you speak to an npc on the beach
2007scape,not_removed,enjoy the loot i dont need it best part
2007scape,not_removed,question how did he only hav rapid as attack option been looking for the answer for a while
2007scape,not_removed,nice double pump
2007scape,not_removed,hes an ironman thats why he said that lol
2007scape,not_removed,its an osb pro feature
2007scape,not_removed,i started yews at im doing it for the afk exp tho not the gold
2007scape,not_removed,a few things and not to be rude or mean but just honesty woodcutting for money isnt a very efficient money making method that being said if you need levels i would cut teaks in the taibwo woodcutting area its or trading sticks to get in and id just drop the logs all the way till redwoods then redwoods to that being said you can afk yews or magics if its something to do while doing homework but id do teaks
2007scape,not_removed,go the wcing guild and cut yews not that much slower than willows are much more afk and you at least get some gold out of it too
2007scape,not_removed,been a while since i sat down and cut any woof
2007scape,not_removed,i dont suggest wcing for money even at its pretty slow ideally you just powerchop teaks to but if you want to make money off of it id say get wcing off teams then chop yews in the woodcutting guild redwoods might be faster money at a certain point but im not sure about that
2007scape,not_removed,a q p
2007scape,not_removed,w
2007scape,not_removed,you chose a dvd for tonight
2007scape,not_removed,saw this guy twice today very annoying edit i actually see myself alching there lol
2007scape,not_removed,received
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,saw that guy too
2007scape,not_removed,you realize this poor fuck likely got his account hacked right
2007scape,not_removed,this is not the place to accuse players of wrongdoing report abuse in game and contact jagex for serious issues feel like sharing please censor names wherever possible
2007scape,not_removed,why the hell have you posted it here just use the ingame report feature ffs its one guy
2007scape,not_removed,let me guess you were silly enough to fall for it so now you want him banned
2007scape,not_removed,scammed
2007scape,not_removed,i dont know about likely but possibly theres scumbags of all levels
2007scape,not_removed,thishas merit i saw another guy dressed the exact same way doing the same thing a few hours earlier same exact thing
2007scape,not_removed,you want to get rid of a scammer therefore you must have gotten scammed
2007scape,not_removed,negative
2007scape,not_removed,you fokin wut mate
2007scape,not_removed,you want to take a murderer off the streets therefore you must have been murdered
2007scape,not_removed,well then you have no evidence so f off
2007scape,not_removed,every world its people doing the same doubling scam what makes this guy so special
2007scape,not_removed,lmoa
2007scape,not_removed,what the fuck did i just read
2007scape,not_removed,lots of people rape why call one of them out
2007scape,not_removed,i bet you think youre clever
2007scape,not_removed,oh im real clever
2007scape,not_removed,bots running around with green drag pets
2007scape,not_removed,say no to petscape
2007scape,not_removed,maybe green from evlarg as a pet we could get a midtier blue dragon boss in taverley wyvern could be super rare like personally im mixed on pets i dont like seeing them all over the place but they are super nice in moderation we could get alot more if there was some sort of tax andor other upkeep like if ensuring ran out after a period of time and if they needed food while uninsured people wouldnt like that though
2007scape,not_removed,so you have a one shot chance at getting a green dragon pet per account
2007scape,not_removed,would make it rare enough to be special they could also make her respawn with a drop table for more pve content
2007scape,not_removed,no thats horrible game design youre basically saying lets give out of every thousand accounts a cosmetic no one else can have as for respawn shes a lvl monster high level people can camp the crap out of her
2007scape,not_removed,ok then dont have it be a one time chance and as for the respawn you act like theres no compromises she could be made tougher after respawn for the sake of the gameplay maybe have her only drop the pet in worlds so members dont just nuke her these are just a couple of the many options that could happen
2007scape,not_removed,to have it be more than time chance you have to figure out respawns making her tougher on respawn makes no sense lorewise members will still go to worlds as the worlds will be filled iirc the elvarg area is not multicombat where their higher cmb stats will overpower the members we already have pets we dont need more for monsters than can be shot fairly easily
2007scape,not_removed,making her tougher on respawn makes no sense lorewise making any unique enemy in the game respawn at all makes no sense lorewise gameplay y she stronker nao the point was to make members go to to use the armor i dont even want there to be a green dragon pet i was only giving an example of how one could enter the game
2007scape,not_removed,the point was to make members go to to use the armor this makes no sense why would you even want to do this even from a business perspective youre encourageing ppl not to buy your product membership i dont even want there to be a green dragon pet say this then
2007scape,not_removed,making any unique enemy in the game respawn at all makes no sense lorewise gameplay y she stronker nao there is a term for this kind of argument i cant remember what its called the point is this is a bad argument
2007scape,not_removed,waterfall quest tree village battle arena and train agility as soon as possible
2007scape,not_removed,quest quest quest there are lots of quests that offer very good xp rewards that are worth more the lower level you are examples of quests you could do are waterfall quest witches house tree gnome village doing these will take and get you melee stats getting stats to the same level could take via training each one check out the wiki for quest xp rewards and pick ones which give xp in skills you like in addition to xp rewards there are other benefits to lots of quests such as unlocking items areas or teleports that are useful
2007scape,not_removed,like everyone has said quest work your way to completing dragon slayer and the rest of the free quests also get your magic up so you can have access to some teleports
2007scape,not_removed,do quest s
2007scape,not_removed,firemaking very important get plus asap also picking flax is excellent money making and finally get yourself def and full granite but a rune full helm best armour 😘
2007scape,not_removed,hours what
2007scape,not_removed,the only thing that threw me off was the fact that you wrote that you used protect from melee assuming that was a typeo cool loots fam good slayer task
2007scape,not_removed,no doubt theyre profitable its just too bad their exp is abysmal i get more exphr from bloodvelds at korund than spectres with cannon
2007scape,not_removed,do you find protect from magic necessary i can kill over per trip with half an inventory of monkfish i do use piety but i dont know if that greatly affects magic defense
2007scape,not_removed,woops ill go change that thanks for the info
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think so but i did this afk you can find better profit results without using cannon or praying
2007scape,not_removed,its a risk
2007scape,not_removed,you wont get banned check the rules on their website
2007scape,not_removed,how come sorry i have knowledge on them and how the game views it i just want to be able to play lol im minutes away from completing and getting my first ever quest cape and ive been trying to do it all day but im constantly dcing
2007scape,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
2007scape,not_removed,using a vpn gives the owner of it all your detailsinformation vpn owners are known for selling your details so this is the risk of using a vpn i know some are trusted but even then i wouldnt try one
2007scape,not_removed,or read the recent post from mod mat k
2007scape,not_removed,good idea thanks for the help
2007scape,not_removed,ah i think ill stay away then
2007scape,not_removed,although if you use a proper vpn the service wont keep track of any of your data giving you private browsing so theres no risk whatsoever if you use a proper vpn service they encrypt your data for safe browsing and privacy not stealing your info
2007scape,not_removed,i guess i was wrong however what i did was used a vpn to load osbuddy then used osbuddys highway and now i can play perfectly normal im not sure if the highway counts as a vpn though
2007scape,not_removed,as long as you use another vpn than they do youre safe so i assume if you actually pay for a properproffesional vpn service youre safe

2007scape,not_removed,its mostly alts you can see the rise in osrs at the release of ironmen theres no reason to have an alt in and ironmen are less popular there but many osrs players have one
2007scape,not_removed,this graph points out that the populations peak amount is the same as the lowest osrs population playing concurrently
2007scape,not_removed,you can spot the times the server crashed in the days above
2007scape,not_removed,how did u get these figures are u a time lord
2007scape,not_removed,close some of your tabs
2007scape,not_removed,days you mean
2007scape,not_removed,days in the above graph and years in the below graph
2007scape,not_removed,potentially this data is simply indictates the numbers regardless of what the numbers represent that could be a percentage of the spike i dont think its as big of a percentage as you think though
2007scape,not_removed,lol thats funny i didnt notice that
2007scape,not_removed,lol im terrible at this isnt even bad for me
2007scape,not_removed,look closer
2007scape,not_removed,this is intentionally incredibly misleading and you know it
2007scape,not_removed,elaborate
2007scape,not_removed,giant graph showing three days not mentioned in title tiny graph on the bottom showing what the title actually mentions
2007scape,not_removed,maybe learn to interpret graphs and you wont have a problem
2007scape,not_removed,it has nothing to do with my ability to interpret graphs its misleading regardless you say nothing in the title about the day graph only the year and the most prominently featured is the day graph you know its misleading and youre just playing stupid if it wasnt meant to mislead you wouldnt have included the day graph which is the size of the only one you refer to in the title
2007scape,not_removed,who the fuck cares like honestly
2007scape,not_removed,if the information displayed misleads you you must have something seriously wrong
2007scape,not_removed,someone just finished their stats class
2007scape,not_removed,you cared enough to respond multiple times and attempt to discredit what im saying youre just baiting people and fueling the hate between the two games
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck how hard is it to understand that stating only that this data is about the last years and making a giant chart on the top that only spans days and a tiny chart on the bottom with the actual data he is speaking of is obviously intentionally misleading im not saying it misled me im saying that the way it is shown is incredibly shady and intentionally trying to mislead people he doesnt mention the fact that of the picture isnt what hes referring to but looks like it is if you dont actually look closer at it hes trying to trick people who only look for a second and say yeah what the fuck weve had way more players for years are you two really so stupid you cant grasp the concept of this being blatantly intentionally misleading
2007scape,not_removed,someone is days late
2007scape,not_removed,youre a special snowflake
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure the max melee hit is an osbuddy feature and has never been accurate
2007scape,not_removed,bonus always i used to go afk for hours in that gear wo exp
2007scape,not_removed,same shame on you rendi thought youd know better d
2007scape,not_removed,max hit at bonus is always
2007scape,not_removed,and thats not osbuddy runescape updated that in
2007scape,not_removed,so this is no longer the case then
2007scape,not_removed,it still is just its physically impossible to splash melee on the dummy for some reason lol
2007scape,not_removed,are those ordinary wieldable flowers
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,healer hat b neck crush
2007scape,not_removed,if is required for hitting of the time why not just use flowers on stab or slash seeing as theyre respectively
2007scape,not_removed,flowers only have crush options
2007scape,not_removed,wait until the weekend and use lms world
2007scape,not_removed,isnt that the high stakes weekend im an ironman and im pretty sure ironmen cant compete plus i dont really think its worth investing just for a sound track
2007scape,not_removed,its
2007scape,not_removed,oh my bad i thought it was high stakes weekend
2007scape,not_removed,all gucci
2007scape,not_removed,restrick trade pre quest points resticted quest points full trade
2007scape,not_removed,no we just need to find the bot farmers ip and then go beat them up in real life angry mob style
2007scape,not_removed,bring back restricted trade thatll solve it
2007scape,not_removed,in what sense the trade limit requirements to actively trade more money details do wonders
2007scape,not_removed,did you not play between that trade limit
2007scape,not_removed,this helped reduce the bots a bit however i remember this being one of the main reasons many people quit the game during that time
2007scape,not_removed,your solution doesnt help either you let players earn pmods and they abuse it which means regular players get banned there is no solution thats a fact we have to live with
2007scape,not_removed,so let the staff set strict guidelines for the pmod the follow when encountering another player breaking the rules if the pmod does not follow them when taking action against the player the pmod will be temporarily powerless while the staff decides how to handle the situation with mutes they are often for good reason with little to no room for discussion as they have always been with bans regarding botting pmods would follow a set checklist provided by staff that would include the bots moving pattern equipment worn total level account creation date etc as well as the amount of time the bot has been observed by the pmod its not that hard to find a solution you seem to think that pmods often abuse their powers jagex would have to interview and carefully observe the actions of the pmod for weeks of playtime example and youre right there is no solution however we have to try
2007scape,not_removed,the staff manually reviewing things is exactly what we have now
2007scape,not_removed,god i miss the days of literally unplayable meaning literally unplayable as opposed to i found a tiny glitch give me fake internet points

2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,all of them
2007scape,not_removed,ahrims and void range is the way to go at range void is actually better than armadyl range
2007scape,not_removed,ahrims range void best offensive gear therefore faster kills less change for damage to be taken ahrims armadyl karils serp helm less switching no need for venoms and higher defensive stats less damage taken but kills are slower so the demage may even out note serp helm costs an hour to use and armadyl is expensive af mage range void inferior to two other alternatives only use if you cant afford ahrims
2007scape,not_removed,man ahrims gear degrades for kill zulrah or not if it degrades it is still good to kill zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,besides ancestral which is bis not but very expensive ahrims is the best gear in game it being degradable isnt an issue at all as the stats dont degrade and the cost is really next to nothing
2007scape,not_removed,fremmy boots klanks gauntlets ardy cloak mort legs elite void top fletching hood lunar staff and desert ammy
2007scape,not_removed,wow thanks all haha that was fast
2007scape,not_removed,and desert ammy
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy shows the actively traded price
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy shows the active trading price of osb users the grand exchange page on the official page only changes by a certain percentage everyday but includes all players generally the osb page will be more accurate
2007scape,not_removed,this is the price difference that some people use to scam always check the activitly traded price for accuracy
2007scape,not_removed,really workin for that pringles sponsorship
2007scape,not_removed,this dude has a mustache on his fking head
2007scape,not_removed,the gift that keeps on giving
2007scape,not_removed,does he actually have mental issues or is it just a random ugly kid with top tier troll not sure if i should feel bad for laughing at him
2007scape,not_removed,it just keeps getting better httpsclipstwitchtvalisonquinnmushymallardthunbeast
2007scape,not_removed,nearly pissed myself laughing at this comment
2007scape,not_removed,cried irl when i saw it closeup
2007scape,not_removed,a very dedicated troll
2007scape,not_removed,there have been a few people that exposed him but im not sure what to believe
2007scape,not_removed,there have been a few people that exposed him but im not sure what to believe
2007scape,not_removed,not really its just never had any reason to be addressed till the recent change pet release completion xp from a course should require doing all the obstacles
2007scape,not_removed,because completing the two obstacles at the end wasnt completing the course it was improperly coded not to look to see if youd done the whole course before giving the xp and wasnt viable to abuse until the fairy ring update every other course in the game will not give you the completion xp if you skip an obstacle for those that its possible at try skipping an obstacle at the wildy course or anywhere else it wont work theres three ways to get to the ghorrock area ice plateau tele lunar wilderness obelisks and ghorrock teleport that place is fine on teleports annakarl has only way to get there and now it has two no big deal
2007scape,not_removed,they did it so youd whine about it
2007scape,not_removed,fairy ring method is a little faster than abyss method when makin nats
2007scape,not_removed,i appreciate that notion i concede that it is a logical fix what im upset by is the ironic need to fix it after years of neglecting it
2007scape,not_removed,i concede the point on the agility course and im not as concerned with it being fixed as i am with the idea that it is suddenly worth fixing as for the house portals im curious as to the reasoning for annakarl and to a lesser extent the digsite tele being added to house portal over any of the other ancient teleports specifically i dont care how many methods are available to reach a location
2007scape,not_removed,i dont care specifically about the course i care about the years of neglect of this bug and now suddenly that its possibly going to stop being dead content its finally worth patching theres no consistency
2007scape,not_removed,define little in terms of xphr
2007scape,not_removed,if its not broken dont fix it it is now broken so time to fix it
2007scape,not_removed,before the fairy ring update you had to go to a fairy ring zanaris input coordinates to the course and then go after recent updates you could home tele right click the fairy ring in poh to go straight to last destination the course get the completion xp and repeat the cycle much faster than previously possible and thus now worth fixing
2007scape,not_removed,depending on ur spawn in castle wars when banking makes it faster if u get better closer spawns i believe its like not even a few exp difference
2007scape,not_removed,im not exactly sure but hutchens tested this method with laps and the average lap time was seconds with fairy rings and seconds with abyss this is with using craft cape to tele to craft guild bank its even better long term too since u dont gotta deal with pkers
2007scape,not_removed,wot
2007scape,not_removed,the notion that it was a bug but not a bug worth fixing till it was worth using is what i find offensive about this also quest cape poh
2007scape,not_removed,and at this point most players who care about time efficiency wont care about that because they are already doing lavas
2007scape,not_removed,there was always a saying if its not broken dont fix it because jagex always fixed things when they were not broken
2007scape,not_removed,efficient load poh layouts that drastically reduce load times are probably better but regardless before the fairy ring update it wouldnt affect the exphr at the course as im sure it was more efficient to do the actual course than to use fairy rings to get just the completion xp it may have been that the osrs team wasnt even aware of it until the fairy ring update anyways
2007scape,not_removed,definately more than difference think its more like p
2007scape,not_removed,right now i got ya i had no idea why you contradicted yourself at first my bad
2007scape,not_removed,theres always the chance of running into pkers on your way to the abyss too only wastes secs per attempt but that adds up
2007scape,not_removed,most definately not you can max around doing both methods
2007scape,not_removed,lava runes
2007scape,not_removed,alright
2007scape,not_removed,nope you just put money in the vial of the money evaporates and then you sell the vial
2007scape,not_removed,there is literally nothing herblore has to offer past level which is in raids anyways so herblore is pretty usless maybe try crafting which offers the fastest bank ingame and is click
2007scape,not_removed,there are no moneymakers or quests that require high herblore not worth it in my opinion but if you really want the cape go for it
2007scape,not_removed,unless you really like the untrimmed herb cape no its not worth it
2007scape,not_removed,thank you for this
2007scape,not_removed,i got mine a few days ago at combat its a great feeling achieving it am i right
2007scape,not_removed,good job dude and its never to late to get a cape hope you enjoy it brotha
2007scape,not_removed,good job man
2007scape,not_removed,nice one bud it can get lost in translation that it is always a heart beater enjoy your cape

2007scape,not_removed,thanks a ton
2007scape,not_removed,i appreciate it i can retire rs now
2007scape,not_removed,thanks but what does that mean
2007scape,not_removed,kill the lvl guys in wildy can take a while
2007scape,not_removed,im killing chaos druids in the edgeville dungeon according to the wiki thats considered the wilderness lol nvm just as i typed this it finally dropped
2007scape,not_removed,its all rng man sometimes it might take a while
2007scape,not_removed,chance really either u get it or u dont
2007scape,not_removed,lmfaoo this is a funny ass pic thank u
2007scape,not_removed,devalues my ingame days of bankstanding no thx
2007scape,not_removed,you should get an own sub i dont post every single ice poseidon oddshot here well when hes not banned its just so annoying cause most people dont care about a screamer streamer thats just playing the game casually with a personality that i dont like
2007scape,not_removed,it looks like he stages a lot of his clips i like him as a streamer but sometimes hell do something stupid in game obviously on purpose and ask if anyone oddshotted it right afterwards i feel like those are the clips that get put on twitch just slightly nongenuine
2007scape,not_removed,tldr leave brittany alone
2007scape,not_removed,has a irrational hate for all streamers
2007scape,not_removed,not like boaty has a sub
2007scape,not_removed,people should realise that his reputation follows him from other games anybody that saw him on league or sc are going to be rightfully skeptical of him
2007scape,not_removed,understandable ive tuned in for a lot of his streams and never gotten that vibe that would change my opinion if i did witness that
2007scape,not_removed,stay in your garage scrub
2007scape,not_removed,tbh i dont see that many boaty posts every time he breathes
2007scape,not_removed,just try not to end up in some year olds sex dungeon only advice i have for meetups in a game with a young demographic like osrs unless you are the year old with the sex dungeon thinking
2007scape,not_removed,on the questioning of players by state someone should do a post where players post their city and or state to see who else plays around them i get that incidents like the pedophile happens but they had one for colleges and i have been curious for one about who in my states plays
2007scape,not_removed,cabot represent haha
2007scape,not_removed,is that old to you are you
2007scape,not_removed,im in littlerock add me salecker
2007scape,not_removed,nah i was making a joke about some kid who went to some pedophiles house when they met up on runescape was in the news some years back
2007scape,not_removed,ive never actually done pyramid plunder but i dont believe this can be reduced to the monty hall problem the trick in the monty hall problem is that the game show host reveals a door that he knows is not a winning door which is what gives you a in the original problem there are only doors of being correct if you switch doors in this case its simply a coincidence that the other player revealed an incorrect door you dont gain any information about the other three doors beyond the fact that the correct door is in one of the three from this because the event itself ie seeing a player pick a wrong door was not motivated by any information such as knowing which doors arearent correct
2007scape,not_removed,i will post the solution if no one figures it out
2007scape,not_removed,pretty sure its the same door for everyone thats why you do it on a world with lots of people
2007scape,not_removed,well i remember there was a game show or something that had options you picked they eliminated one of the other choices and you could switch or stay with original chance its in original chance if you switch i imagine it is the same and in this case problem is a bit of a mindfuck when you first think about it but at the same time it is simple
2007scape,not_removed,try one of the other doors its always optimal to switch after ur first choice because u are betting that u u were right twice in a row assuming chance first time and then the next time when u could be going for the chance of it not being the first door you pick
2007scape,not_removed,i think you gotta analyze the probability of every situation so supposing you decide to switch doors if you initially chose one of the wrong you now have a chance so of is of getting the correct one if you picked the correct door at the beginning and decided to switch theres a chance of getting the correct door in the end now in the event of you deciding not to switch theres a of getting the correct door and of getting a wrong one in the end the possibility that has the highest probability of being right is the one meaning youre hoping to get one of the wrong doors then switching after the other guy reveals another of the wrong doors in this case the one on the left and then switching to one of the two remaining hoping you get the correct one what do you guys think sorry if i made mistakes english is not my first language
2007scape,not_removed,so i did look up the original problem and ill admit that i lost a good hour of sleep trying to work backwards from the answer to understand it what i simplified it to is this using the original question if there are doors correct one and incorrect ones and you first select your choice you initially of course have a chance of being correct now the other person who knows which doors are wrong must reveal one of the remaining doors but they will always reveal a wrong door so the key is to see the possibilities in this situation choice your choice is the correct one and the other are incorrect choice is correct and choice is correct so within the possibilities there is a chance that your choice is wrong now since either choice or choice is removed an incorrect one only the remaining possibilities are as follows you are right and the other one is wrong you are wrong and the other one is right you are wrong and the other one is right so in of the worlds the remaining choice that isnt yours is the right one how that applies to this situation well i dont remember how many doors are in pp but if there are then you have possibilities to look at if you simplify it to doors then you need to have some assumptions in place the other guy must somehow always be wrong the other guy could have picked any door that wasnt yours what confuses me is that if the other guy always picks the leftmost door then you dont gain much information about the other doors i think youd still have an equal chance among the other doors
2007scape,not_removed,i made a small edit httpimgurcomaipthg
2007scape,not_removed,s i know him
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt a lot to me but all that matters is that it a lot for you gratz op
2007scape,not_removed,woot gz
2007scape,not_removed,lol i remember when i got strength i play solo and was in the clan chat a i was like in strength most of the comments were wow didnt know an untrimmed skillcape was an achievement
2007scape,not_removed,cool
2007scape,not_removed,congrats
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,fletching woo
2007scape,not_removed,how did you get fletch with only mage longbow new meta
2007scape,not_removed,how did you made that
2007scape,not_removed,fletching
2007scape,not_removed,do you not use the wikia for clues you really should if you dont unless you like the challenge you can find all the answers to every clue on there
2007scape,not_removed,wizards tower south of draynor village
2007scape,not_removed,haha wow i didnt realize there were only so many clue scrolls out there im new to and clue scrolls thanks for the answer as well as the resource
2007scape,not_removed,even if you like doing clues without looking them up on the wiki map clues are the type no one should waste time figuring out on their own
2007scape,not_removed,this is so cute
2007scape,not_removed,nice screenshot its behind the wizard tower
2007scape,not_removed,arent you on osbuddy doesnt it show you in the client unless the home teleport thing isnt just an osbuddy thing and is in the official client
2007scape,not_removed,is it bad ive done so many medium clues i dont even have to look them up anymore just from the tiny thumbnail i knew it was the wizards tower one
2007scape,not_removed,glad to see new people to if you ever need a friend for tips or help send me a pm with your runescape name ill gladly chat you up
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think it does anything for map clues does it
2007scape,not_removed,yes im on osbuddy didnt see any label good to know for other clues though
2007scape,not_removed,it has a world map beside the clue click on it and it shows you the location only appears for some map clues not sure why
2007scape,not_removed,didnt the elder maul have its crush attack buffed to because players said it was to inaccurate so it has more attack than a godsword and crush is usually more accurate than slash
2007scape,not_removed,what do you want me to say its not like you would believe me anyway if i told you the truth theres always going to be a paranoia around balancing gear and people should just accept that and judge a suggestion by the merits of the argument if not then everybody will just end up shit slinging like its the cold war people accused each other of being kgb spies without being able to prove anything
2007scape,not_removed,ah yes thats true i was going off an outdated image thats a decent middle ground then
2007scape,not_removed,mods are on holiday give it a week
2007scape,not_removed,i hope so man its not just mining either attack bots wc bots its crazy i feel like im the only real person playing lol
2007scape,not_removed,click reply on the bottom right where uosrsknight commented to reply to his comment on the issue of bots mot mat k has said that they estimate only iirc bots are on at a time im the only real person playing reality is that you are probably just going to the most heavily botted places particularly if you are still
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i just started again so still ill be a member once i see im gonna actually stick to playing
2007scape,not_removed,is obviously known to be absolutely plagued with bots areas that are crowded to hell in are completely empty in as there are going to be different methods of botting
2007scape,not_removed,agree i think they catch more flak than they deserve
2007scape,not_removed,despite some things i think theyre pretty fucking awesome
2007scape,not_removed,i like how they actively participate in the community
2007scape,not_removed,i like ash hes a funny guy alright
2007scape,not_removed,yeah you really get to appreciate them when you read this
2007scape,not_removed,i think the development team is awesome its just that their balancing of drop tables needs a lot of work as they still havent learned since zulrah
2007scape,not_removed,with the enthusiasm the players have its great to have developers to match
2007scape,not_removed,for me the honor goes to grinding gear games very transparent they arent afraid to delay an expansion to make sure its not completely fucked on release easily the best game ive ever even seen i think the only area the game itself is beaten by rs would be content due to how repetitive poe is by nature i just dont see them as being very comparable to the devs of os or
2007scape,not_removed,overtime to push out content rushed content
2007scape,not_removed,i agree i have played a lot of mmos and other online games and just the weekly qa jagex does seems like more player interaction than most
2007scape,not_removed,best development team out of any game ive played keep up the good work boys
2007scape,not_removed,i like the mmk banter on stream
2007scape,not_removed,downvote me in your circlejerk thread but theyre actually incredibly unprofessional unreliable and ill informed the majority of your points are praising the best game developers ive ever witnessed for doing the fundamentals of their jobs this should be expected not commended
2007scape,not_removed,i absolutey agree with you for a small team they are excellent
2007scape,not_removed,id probably say imo i cant say a bad thing about the old bungie that made halo and reach they were just an amazing team all the games were all very different but somehow didnt end up a fail it was an amazing time they always had a weekly update explaining whats going on or talking about tournaments going on atm
2007scape,not_removed,yeah ive never seen a better dev team in any other game ive ever played they are just awesome
2007scape,not_removed,i play another game which has underwhelming development at best way out of line with community expectations or even whats needed to keep the game alive playing osrs again was a huge breath of fresh air kudos to the team
2007scape,not_removed,runescape and rust have similar development styles imo theyre both fucking great jagex and facepunch more companies should look at how you do things
2007scape,not_removed,certainly better than the wow devs they literally ignore feedback for months and then finally do a hamfisted balance change and fuck everything up more
2007scape,not_removed,burnout is a thing i hope they dont overwork and in two years they quit because they cant handle it anymore
2007scape,not_removed,old school best team ever
2007scape,not_removed,im not saying they arent nice people but there is a god damn problem
2007scape,not_removed,stop my abs hurt
2007scape,not_removed,lol if you want to keep it real as many mistakes they have made that would have never been tolerated in a real work place the majority of them would have been fired multiple times by now jagex is not the worst but they can act very unprofessional like you have mod mat k who is married and has kids trying to have sex with in game streamers emilyispro
2007scape,not_removed,my biggest gripe with the osrs mod team is that i feel that the majority of the jmods dont actually play runescape anymore and it really shows in the updates its great that as a community we can vote on future updates but it also means theres a massive delay before things that need to be done get done because the jmods are frankly out of touch with what people do in rs while i dont expect the jmods to be playing at efficiency and knowledgeable itd be nice if they actually enjoyed the game they worked on so that they dont need to make a reddit thread in order to find qol changes in this ancient fucking game
2007scape,not_removed,modmatk and others have constantly stated how the staff are staying up very late and overtime to push out content they let their superiors abuse them so they can force out shitty content every week
2007scape,not_removed,is this a joke
2007scape,not_removed,fire archie
2007scape,not_removed,wrong they dont even test there content before it rolls out i feel bad for people that work there they probably get clowned looking for another job for having jagex on there job history jagex always have some kind of major breaking bug every update this would never be tolerated in a real corporate world
2007scape,not_removed,not even close
2007scape,not_removed,but they make shit content nice guys tho
2007scape,not_removed,im cunfuse
2007scape,not_removed,the amount of respect i have for them as developers is second to none instead of cowering from criticism hoping it blows over they address it head on saying why they cancant do it and what theyre going to do about it the passion just seeps through everything that they do they make misteps but so does everyone it takes some real courage and love to say yeah we screwed up but this is how were gonna fix it jamflex lyfe
2007scape,not_removed,sometimes criticism is needed im just glad that theyre taking it quite well
2007scape,not_removed,hey its hutchens the reddit guy
2007scape,not_removed,fuck yeah path of exile and runescape are the two games i always come back to
2007scape,not_removed,duel arena is ready trades zgs to an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,as long as its runescape related
2007scape,not_removed,game developers typically openly communicate with players and make timely changes based on direct feedback from players ive literally not had a single other game ive played do this
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i am with you on this i can only speak for the places i have worked but from my experience unpaid overtime is commonplace and it not considered anything special its not a part time minimum wage job of course they arent just scrapping the minimum expectations most of their work is released incomplete and often still with obvious oversights some of the unprofessionalism can be attributed to the over head strategy of pushing lots of large updates to built hype its not clear if that comes from the osrs team or not through
2007scape,not_removed,yeah and the problem is the community
2007scape,not_removed,you know content is polled right
2007scape,not_removed,a ton of developers expect this of their employees it has been starting to improve in recent years but game development jobs overall still demand ridiculous hours just recently cd projekt red started mass hiring and they openly set expectations that their new employees be willing to work many hour shifts and a lot of crunch time in general this is completely normal behavior in the games industry at present
2007scape,not_removed,source
2007scape,not_removed,youre a joke downvotes so far
2007scape,not_removed,oh no every other game never had a bug slip to the live game and its not really a bug it was more of an oversight by removing an interface
2007scape,not_removed,exactly they take mistakes head on its great to see
2007scape,not_removed,what about the nmz issue that took years to rectify
2007scape,not_removed,lmao as many mistakes they have made majority of them would have been fired at any other company
2007scape,not_removed,cant believe they overlooked this even though lms had ironman problems already lol
2007scape,not_removed,idc lol i think its great
2007scape,not_removed,most indiesmall developers do which is effectively the catagory the osrs team falls into
2007scape,not_removed,rocket league developers psyonix are on their subreddit and other social media outlets all the time they even play with their players
2007scape,not_removed,only and the part of about answering outside of office hours are considered non standard by a development team
2007scape,not_removed,i dont see what that has to do with there being too many updates if theyre too swamped to do it without releasing game breaking bugs they should take their time
2007scape,not_removed,my point exactly
2007scape,not_removed,still after a couple of quite successful games and this many years in business a majority of the people i know have played at least once
2007scape,not_removed,you go be a developer and you release perfect code every time then come make some aids post on reddit
2007scape,not_removed,dont confuse the osrs team for jagex theyre what a man team with relatively little resources they effectively all contribute to all areas of development they may work for a major established brand but the way they function is near identical to indie developers
2007scape,not_removed,what if a top chef undercooked my chicken
2007scape,not_removed,maybe to him thats the standard of chicken and youve had it wrong your whole life
2007scape,not_removed,fucking gross
2007scape,not_removed,its only gross because your whole life youve been lied to about how chicken should be prepared
2007scape,not_removed,no you need a bank pin and authenticator for both your rs account and email
2007scape,not_removed,common sense™ is the best antivirus
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,used in addition to the security options provided by jagex and your email there isnt much beyond that you can do with software yes they will work fine however keep in mind that no antivirusmalwarespyware program is fool proof
2007scape,not_removed,you dont need antivirus if youre not a dum
2007scape,not_removed,deleted
2007scape,not_removed,lol nothing can protect your runescape account against you
2007scape,not_removed,i use a dragon defender not sure about windows defender
2007scape,not_removed,nah get ublock origin its much better adblock sold out to ad companies and will show you the ads who paid adblock actually stole their code which is why adblock isnt open source ಠಠ
2007scape,not_removed,deleted
2007scape,not_removed,ahhhh alright well maybe someone will get ublock instead because of my comment
2007scape,not_removed,uh you should really not be discussing that on here
2007scape,not_removed,a raccoon

2007scape,not_removed,i have hard clues done plus like elites i have never once encountered a pker am i just lucky or does everyone just exaggerate like fuck
2007scape,not_removed,just item it if you die you lose nothing
2007scape,not_removed,am i the only one who goes looking for pkers so they can kill me and get my energy back
2007scape,not_removed,man we aint even got revenants back in those days i was so young goose bumps would form as i heard the sounds of a revenant orks attack
2007scape,not_removed,thats why they made total worlds
2007scape,not_removed,easiest way go into a dead world get to near the clue location and hop to a members world least you dont have to deal with freezes 😂
2007scape,not_removed,this is great
2007scape,not_removed,ive done a lot of clues only happened to me once had to drop my monkfish though rip
2007scape,not_removed,go to the lowest pop server you can find

2007scape,not_removed,how tf you plan on killing armadylian guardians
2007scape,not_removed,i have like hards done and ive gotten killed at least like times its not that common but its pretty annoying when it does
2007scape,not_removed,im almost at hards and around something elites personally ive been killed very few times and most of the times its using the lever and randomly stumbling upon someone camping it although im not really concerned with pkers because i bring the bare minimum for the clue spade weapon tele and the clue itself
2007scape,not_removed,ive got about hards and elites been killed less than times and only of those times did i actually lose the clue just drop it and run back only time i ever get attacked is when i run into a team and they wanna look mad tight in front of their bros
2007scape,not_removed,no your lucky im looking for you
2007scape,not_removed,i think im on like hards done and have run into maybe or pkers i think ive only died once however just dropped my clue and went back and got it he didnt even take anything i had on me anyway so nothing lost edit i have actually run into alot more people ive just managed to log before they could attack me i pretty much run through the wild with my mouse on the log out button
2007scape,not_removed,yes just lucky man only done and i have easily gotten pkd times
2007scape,not_removed,they exaggerate
2007scape,not_removed,same as you seems like people like to exaggerate i dont even bother banking anymore so gf rune pouch if someone happens to come across me but hasnt happened yet
2007scape,not_removed,i got pked on my last step of a very annoying hard clue two days ago pkers received the following incredible loot a spade aholes
2007scape,not_removed,how bout the clues that need you to wear items plus your clue scroll and a weapon if need be
2007scape,not_removed,i do this i had the panic at the wildy volcano one and i saw a huge pure team at the teleported by the castle ran up and start calling them all noobs and got killed really quick
2007scape,not_removed,still gotta worry bout that bind tho
2007scape,not_removed,nah breh you just slap on retribution and they immediately off you lmao then proceed to rag them with retrib and a cast or of barrage
2007scape,not_removed,run away hop worlds dig again and hope for bandos guardian
2007scape,not_removed,setup was for hards for elites swap dds for cbowblowpipe
2007scape,not_removed,not annoying to me i plan on dying for that free tp and just bring the items i need or and drop a spadeknife if i encounter a pker
2007scape,not_removed,that was a legitimate strategy in because in everyone so there was no incentive to kill an unskulled itemer if you see someone in the wild not in with no items theyre clearly up to something and must be destroyed
2007scape,not_removed,clue box
2007scape,not_removed,i just keep shit in my inventory and i just start dropping
2007scape,not_removed,the only one is that one at zammy temple item with clue and protect item ancients tele to graveyard pick up steel dagger from spawn spot kill mage and drop it
2007scape,not_removed,i do it for nearly all wilderness clues as most of the time its better than running back to the lever and having to walk it half way through if i cant find a pker i just attack some monsters
2007scape,not_removed,or use a blowpipe
2007scape,not_removed,nobody got time fo that shit
2007scape,not_removed,bandit camp one too
2007scape,not_removed,well one of those items for the zammy clue is an iron platebody which you can just drop if you get attacked so you dont risk anything bringing a weapon too
2007scape,not_removed,lava volcano one
2007scape,not_removed,its like in the ge lol
2007scape,not_removed,you can kill it with the rune pickaxe and not risk anything
2007scape,not_removed,headband crozier clue weapon no risk
2007scape,not_removed,muh ironman
2007scape,not_removed,too much
2007scape,not_removed,runecrafting content residentsleeper
2007scape,not_removed,no lol ice poseidon is better bro
2007scape,not_removed,nah vote for ice piss
2007scape,not_removed,i got from the drop party ice had so he can have my vote
2007scape,not_removed,id rather shove a rat up my ass than vote for that view botting
2007scape,not_removed,is gonna win sadly i cant vote for my fav streamer cus you need an rs account to vote
2007scape,not_removed,no smorc
2007scape,not_removed,ive watched alot of and after the last deadman mode of the time he was doing boring skilling content caused me to stop watching him after a while because i was going to rip my face off otherwise
2007scape,not_removed,chat moves to slow to be legit
2007scape,not_removed,yeah because most people who watch streams watch on full screen and dont do chat interaction this guy probably thinks hes view botting because of the viewbotexe on his desktop btw chat moving too slow to be legit is usually due to slow mode being enabled to help huge streamers read things easier
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i hate it when its zoomed all the way out with extra shit on the side
2007scape,not_removed,i ate
2007scape,not_removed,rest in peace
2007scape,not_removed,it does make me feel better that i got a bcp that trip but still ill go for it again p
2007scape,not_removed,this fits the mood
2007scape,not_removed,atleast you got a bcp that trip sorry for the pet though
2007scape,not_removed,i feel your pain the same thing happened to me man at kc i got a bandos pet as well then my tank dcd and died and as i was running to altar tele i got sucker punched for a and died now im up to kc and still no pet
2007scape,not_removed,i would be pissed too if this happened sorry to hear
2007scape,not_removed,looks like youre not pvms finest
2007scape,not_removed,poor poor poooor you id probably just sit there in silence for hours lol
2007scape,not_removed,this is why you tab as soon as you get a pet lol
2007scape,not_removed,wow thats such bs im sorry for your loss i actually gasped irl haha
2007scape,not_removed,id drink bleach
2007scape,not_removed,alright ill be the one to ask how are there more than four items in your inventory after dying
2007scape,not_removed,just to make you feel worse my friend and i both level went to duo bandos yesterday i was tanking and we got kills on the kill before we left he got a bandos pet on kc d
2007scape,not_removed,if it makes you feel better know that i got
2007scape,not_removed,lol what in the flying fuck why did you keep like things
2007scape,not_removed,literally happened the same tick as i died
2007scape,not_removed,because untradeables arent lost on death and stuff in rune pouch wont be lost either so i kept the bcps and bgs
2007scape,not_removed,no it probably doesnt make him feel better seeing as you still have a mutagen way under the drop rate
2007scape,not_removed,dudeee i hate you hahah im at kc and the only reason i keep killing that fucking snake is for a mutagen also you got my favorite out of the two
2007scape,not_removed,the bcps and the godsword are his items kept on death the guthans has been damaged so it has been untradeable and so was the rune pouch and all of the runes inside of it so they were all kept on death as well
2007scape,not_removed,because the temporary death mechanics are really balanced
2007scape,not_removed,i
2007scape,not_removed,i physically cringed
2007scape,not_removed,oh man that sucks
2007scape,not_removed,full guthans set bcp and a godsword thats items
2007scape,not_removed,sounds like a glitch
2007scape,not_removed,lol cringe i bet you also use words like cancer neckbeard and autistic
2007scape,not_removed,the guthans is untradable
2007scape,not_removed,due to recent ddosing last year they made you keep all untradables on death in pvm combat along with whatever else
2007scape,not_removed,not a glitch you keep untradeables on death which includes barrows items that are degraded
2007scape,not_removed,not really its been here a for over a year and it isnt going away anytime soon its just how the game is now you also have an hour to get to your loot
2007scape,not_removed,fuuuuck you d
2007scape,not_removed,only when describing you
2007scape,not_removed,lmao seriously thats broken af that shit needs to be fixed yesterday
2007scape,not_removed,so easyscape
2007scape,not_removed,rekt tho
2007scape,not_removed,so hes still right even if he wasnt talking to you but thanks for proving his point
2007scape,not_removed,not really its been here a for over a year and it isnt going away anytime soon its just how the game is now you also have an hour to get to your loot
2007scape,not_removed,so easyscape
2007scape,not_removed,kind of but for a good reason with this system in mind before this system people would ddos the servers to screw other people over with the death mechanics we have now while ppl can still ddos the server there is very little gain out of it and will just waste their time and money
2007scape,not_removed,waste of dev time
2007scape,not_removed,feel free to add me i wont be on for an hour or so though rsn iigomeep
2007scape,not_removed,this game has always been a part of my life i grew up playing it and to see it again back to the way i loved it makes me want to keep playing there are always new updates to be excited for and i myself cant wait for raids just log on start training and youll find tons of players in game as well as on reddit
2007scape,not_removed,its kind of slow and super casual atleast at the beginning when you dont know anyone and have no gear i guess without the initial spark it seems super overwhelming and flat out not even worth it to dive into this game
2007scape,not_removed,yeah well fucking nz is still fucked
2007scape,not_removed,ive been using the osb highways and have only dcd twice in the last couple days
2007scape,not_removed,nz whats that
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,people dont share all the shit loot drops thats why youre only seeing good loot posted
2007scape,not_removed,meds plenty of solid loot pairs of wizard boots youre not going to get massive rewards every single clue some people will get really lucky the way i look at it is dont expect to get anything good ever
2007scape,not_removed,hey man at least yours are worth i did hard clues yesterday and they were all somewhere in the range each keep grinding and eventually youll hit the big one
2007scape,not_removed,cheer up man if it makes you feel better ive done hard clues with a max of profit in a clue
2007scape,not_removed,thats enough to make me sad
2007scape,not_removed,but but i do clues to keep slayer more efficent but with those
2007scape,not_removed,bruhhhhh i finally got loot gl to you hope you get better
2007scape,not_removed,just keep at it youll get something worth posting eventually
2007scape,not_removed,still more than you had before
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for the motivation
2007scape,not_removed,the is not worth all those steps man feel my pain please
2007scape,not_removed,if you know the pin you can change it instantly
2007scape,not_removed,how would they get his pin in the first place though
2007scape,not_removed,use on email use authenticator use bank pin use different passwords everywhere use virus scanner do all that and nobody is gonna mess with your acc
2007scape,not_removed,rat or malware targeted towards rs players and records pins or his rs gf scammed him and stole his items
2007scape,not_removed,blowpipe to range get that strength to at least and go merk some people bruh
2007scape,not_removed,max the range at the highest you can at your combat level use combat level calc then pk what else on a def build
2007scape,not_removed,get def and name yourself oops
2007scape,not_removed,should i get my prayer from to for eagle eye guess youre right about the combat calc ill see if its worth it thanks guys
2007scape,not_removed,yes you should get you may as well get actually you can be with that prayer when maxed or you can be when maxed with prayer
2007scape,not_removed,feelsbadman
2007scape,not_removed,good job d cant wait to see you progress and post about getting a more expensive drop later as you level
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt take a pic but on my last kill i got a rune battleaxe not sure if i should be happy or cry
2007scape,not_removed,fuck what everyone else is saying nice job man its a good drop to get from them
2007scape,not_removed,keep on slayin the rewards get juicier
2007scape,not_removed,use that rope to kill yourself
2007scape,not_removed,awww
2007scape,not_removed,you got a rune scim so
2007scape,not_removed,grats on kid
2007scape,not_removed,it was my first task of fire giants and its a rare drop from them thanks for making me feel bad about myself
2007scape,not_removed,ay dont feel bad lol i got a rune scim on my first kill and was over the moon about it
2007scape,not_removed,are you its not rare its worth so plz stop acting like your
2007scape,not_removed,people like you dont deserve to be on this website
2007scape,not_removed,oh no are you hurt
2007scape,not_removed,or yknow just dont considering the pvp community is cancer af
2007scape,not_removed,doubt it would pass a poll but just wanted to put it out there
2007scape,not_removed,no people wanted the spear changed now they have to deal with it
2007scape,not_removed,nah i want to keep my dbow
2007scape,not_removed,waterfall quest is definitely something to get done early
2007scape,not_removed,while youre id train skills up like fishing cooking and wc since they are pretty much no faster in members than they are look up the requirements for recipe for disaster full quest and start chipping away at those doing the full recipe for disaster quest will knock out just about all the important quests youll need to do as well as getting you decent base stats overall to get you started in any direction you want to go
2007scape,not_removed,first of all add me because i am a nice guy in addition i recommend getting membership asap because simply you will gain more from the game by doing that and lvl up quicker and stuff case in point most monsters even the low level ones drop herbs in some way you can collect rannars for each and easily be able to afford rune even dragon in a few hours add to that areas would be less creamped and you would level up quicker but if youre still set on doing first then get all the quests knocked out as having decent stats which you need for doing quests will definitely help you in accomplishing the other quests for members and such
2007scape,not_removed,nice fire cape
2007scape,not_removed,haha my cat used to do that when he was a kitten lie right on my mousepad
2007scape,not_removed,tgw
2007scape,not_removed,kitty be staring at the screen like yes murder them
2007scape,not_removed,gz on the sapphire
2007scape,not_removed,same got rid of my cat
2007scape,not_removed,death runes
2007scape,not_removed,get elite void there u go
2007scape,not_removed,its iconic sorry that you started playing after eoc but its not changing
2007scape,not_removed,i think of the osrs pop agrees with you good luck tho i personally think void looks badass
2007scape,not_removed,yeah youre right wish we could add helms to achievement diary though
2007scape,not_removed,and who are you exactly
2007scape,not_removed,ive been around since in the background dont worry about me
2007scape,not_removed,i think youll find that thats a gnome robe top the blue wizard one you can either find in the ge or down south of draynor in the wizards tower youll have to murder one
2007scape,not_removed,k lol
2007scape,not_removed,get mems and in days you can easily earn money for another bond digging saltpetre is per hour afk with no requirements
2007scape,not_removed,unless you only play a few hrs a week id say use the bond playing a couple hours a day days a week you should be able to maintain membership
2007scape,not_removed,dont use it if is nostalgic for you stick with it sell the bond it will make your experience more fun
2007scape,not_removed,also why is blast furnace okay but not fishing trawler ass
2007scape,not_removed,why would you suggest the removal of existing content a fighter torso is a great replacement for rune plate early on because it can be obtained about as fast as it takes to make for the plate body from oziach and is more consistent that clue rewards not to mention its a good melee too because bcp is very good me game on imm
2007scape,not_removed,they should make it so iron men can do it in some way but yea they have been negecting iron man mode since day so dont get your hopes up
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,shut up idiot
2007scape,not_removed,you dont get to make ultimatums
2007scape,not_removed,not to mention void is an important component to using the chins you get from hunter which is arguable the best way to acquire key items like glories and various other supplies from d imps and the use of poro poro
2007scape,not_removed,he was making a point
2007scape,not_removed,in they made it so you could do group content group bosses with limited teamsizes exclusively as ironman with other ironman i dont see a problem with this as the drops are either individual loot anyway or one would just screw all but then again all supplies used etc are selfgathered and limited teamsize if possible would make leeching very hard if not impossiblei guess first one will be the case individual loot for everyone
2007scape,not_removed,i wasnt being literal
2007scape,not_removed,i agree this would be a nice solution and if im not mistaken they talked about this already in the qa so lets hope
2007scape,not_removed,and
2007scape,not_removed,party at falador
2007scape,not_removed,you being a retard and not realizing its a joke post makes you cringe
2007scape,not_removed,this is kinda flawed because what actually determines the boss to be soloed if its just person dealing damage than a person can get a really fast time with other players doing spec transfer and veng other they would somehow have to have be only one person in the room from start to death of the boss i feel like this would be difficult on jagexs end to do
2007scape,not_removed,private room
2007scape,not_removed,p pots are similar gpxp for double the xph
2007scape,not_removed,tbh i dont even think many people care about herblore besides diaries or max cape
2007scape,not_removed,cannonballs is probably the best low req thing you can flip or cook usually karams but you need a very high cooking level for that to be really effective
2007scape,not_removed,how do you not get fired though lol wherever you work they usually monitor what sites u go on
2007scape,not_removed,cannonballs are probably the best because it takes literally three minutes and some seconds for each inventory
2007scape,not_removed,oh ya thatd be a good idea
2007scape,not_removed,it worker boss is cool with me doing this as long as i can answer the phone
2007scape,not_removed,ya im also doing the fast method keeping noted steel bars mould and cballs in inv makes cballs per load this makes it for fast banking and hopping to the furnace super helpful for keeping track of loads as well load i am in edgeville doing this as well
2007scape,not_removed,minutes seconds
2007scape,not_removed,howd you ask him curious can i play some games while i have nothing to do
2007scape,not_removed,its a small company and a really nice techie company i just setup my laptop last week and was fishing lobsters he came into my office and i had it up and totally in view he asked me what i was doing and i told him i explained how its afk and im not actually playing he said cool and just said dont let it affect my work so far so good so ive been playing at work for like days so far i actually might get some others playing and try and make a group bossing or skilling party
2007scape,not_removed,niceeeeeeeee
2007scape,not_removed,no
2007scape,not_removed,this is a horrible idea
2007scape,not_removed,we need this asap
2007scape,not_removed,dragon stone sink the gems degrade you cast the different enchantment spells on a cut dragonstone for different effects
2007scape,not_removed,it seems a little off for me
2007scape,not_removed,this is just a bad idea even if you only used sapphire emerald ruby diamond and no gem as options for each slot thats new items with icons and skins each malefemale which would need to be added to the game for the sake of fashionscape
2007scape,not_removed,if it aint broke dont fix it
2007scape,not_removed,why not please lets have a constructive conversation
2007scape,not_removed,what about it makes you think its horrible
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,its not a matter of fixing something its a matter of adding onto it itd make a pretty good gem sink too
2007scape,not_removed,well for one kinda sounds ridiculous why would you put gems in the armour like that they arent magical by themselves not to mention you would need to add a new fighter torso item for every iteration of the slots and every gem in each slot
2007scape,not_removed,did you see the suggestion lol
2007scape,not_removed,gems dont typically sit around theyre usually made into jewelry
2007scape,not_removed,lmao think of how many gems there are in game compared to torsos if there was a gem sink needed then this wouldnt be the way to do it
2007scape,not_removed,well i would think about it i the light of how dragons are thought to lay on gems and now you could have gems on your tummy just like a dragon is thought to have
2007scape,not_removed,yep unless you dont stop training agility because then they keep spawning and each time they spawn then it resets the timer
2007scape,not_removed,after minutes
2007scape,not_removed,runscape lol but snapback
2007scape,not_removed,get some stickers for your car
2007scape,not_removed,imagine all the hot pockets you could buy instead of nerd merch
2007scape,not_removed,snapback the empty lord shall reward your loyalty
2007scape,not_removed,literally nothing
2007scape,not_removed,tbh none of them x why would you need a foam dds d and for the snapback there are way cooler snapbacks around but if i had to decide between these two id choose the snapback
2007scape,not_removed,whoops on the typo in the title its and just about to fall asleep
2007scape,not_removed,actually currently i have no need for a car so i aint got one lol looking for a relatively cheap one soon though
2007scape,not_removed,im sorry but im not even the biggest fan of hot pockets the only one i find decent is like the ham and cheese
2007scape,not_removed,foam dds to get rid of any female interaction
2007scape,not_removed,well geez i would spec my friends and family out duh str attack pure no but seriously i have a well rounded main account the only reason i am going to buy it is because i just have lil money sitting around and i dont mind getting something from the game i love d
2007scape,not_removed,get stickers then buy a car d
2007scape,not_removed,steak and cheese tho
2007scape,not_removed,id love to see how you spec them out irl
2007scape,not_removed,i too enjoy eating previously recalled versions of hot pockets
2007scape,not_removed,starts at until its just a looped section of newbie melody
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,didnt think i would ever have to say this but tell us the bug
2007scape,not_removed,this is fascinating
2007scape,not_removed,one already exists its between your shoulders
2007scape,not_removed,although impressive my collarbone cant solve puzzles
2007scape,not_removed,not with that attitude
2007scape,not_removed,no advice animals or other image macros
2007scape,not_removed,haha
2007scape,not_removed,httpimgurcomnfqfdqz
2007scape,not_removed,thanks guys
2007scape,not_removed,gz
2007scape,not_removed,nice
2007scape,not_removed,wtf gz bro
2007scape,not_removed,gratz
2007scape,not_removed,and here i am with fire making on mine and no phoenix

2007scape,not_removed,lmfao
2007scape,not_removed,servers arent bad you are just too far away
2007scape,not_removed,vouch im from alberta and the ping is awful
2007scape,not_removed,the world or the people
2007scape,not_removed,or he has internet speed
2007scape,not_removed,he says shit servers
2007scape,not_removed,was a joke dont get your knickers in a twist
2007scape,not_removed,im not wearing knickers
2007scape,not_removed,im not wearing hockey pads
2007scape,not_removed,give me money
2007scape,not_removed,might have to put this in my poh so i can check if there are pkers when i get callisto tasks
2007scape,not_removed,varrock massacre intensifies
2007scape,not_removed,you can see players on the main screen and minimap good luck
2007scape,not_removed,whenever i close my scry pool it kick me out of the house is that right
2007scape,not_removed,big brother is always watching
2007scape,not_removed,if you use a scrying pool like this and someone is standing next to you and they get barraged do you get hit if you die like this where do your items go
2007scape,not_removed,scrying pools actually have a use now
2007scape,not_removed,you view annakarl you still have no idea where it is
2007scape,not_removed,its broken though every time you do this you get kicked out of poh
2007scape,not_removed,but now the pkers will be watching through there as well waiting for you to think it is clear we are never safe anymore
2007scape,not_removed,when i was doing it earlier i was able to scry all portals then it kicked me out
2007scape,not_removed,i know thats how it was back in the day but i think with the new construction room updates it might have been fixed
2007scape,not_removed,you cant die from looking through a scrying pool
2007scape,not_removed,greater demons in level wilderness on the eastern side
2007scape,not_removed,shit
2007scape,not_removed,you can see players scrying their name at least will pop up but they wont be there or at least that was how it was last time i tried it
2007scape,not_removed,great paradox
2007scape,not_removed,jagex just added a whole new element to pking
2007scape,not_removed,feel the fear i for one am terrified of entering the wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,where do their names show up
2007scape,not_removed,anything that can go wrong will go wrong
2007scape,not_removed,people bot banning bots to bot
2007scape,not_removed,so how does jagex decide who isnt a bot and how does this stop people from just banning anyone who they dont like
2007scape,not_removed,but what if i made an army of bots that went around banning people randomly then the bots would win
2007scape,not_removed,terrible idea not everyone has good intentions
2007scape,not_removed,so everyone perm bans emilyispro but how does that help with stopping bots
2007scape,not_removed,ouch my head hurts
2007scape,not_removed,what everyone is always sure about who isisnt a bot this will definitely work s
2007scape,not_removed,bring a hammer as well the brazier will break periodically and you can fix it then relight it for points each
2007scape,not_removed,do it solo just keep or braziers lit until the energy goes below or maybe even after that just keep one lit and be sure to have rejuvenation pots this way you can keep the energy fluctuating between fletchingburning and chopping roots as long as you only light the brazier when you are ready to feed kindlings into the fire
2007scape,not_removed,ahrims is already good enough but karils and torags would get my vote
2007scape,not_removed,really the ahrims full set is good enough
2007scape,not_removed,its a pretty prominent mage armour sure the armour effect isnt good but it stats are
2007scape,not_removed,well the point is reworking the useless set effects
2007scape,not_removed,just learned about amulet of damned effects with barrows take a look
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,refuses to believe in random number generation believes theres a conspiracy theory against him comes to reddit and expects not to be flamed
2007scape,not_removed,need a tldr bro youre saying you broke the rules and instead of punishing you the normal way they chose to make you lose at the duel arena reread this and tell me how it sounds
2007scape,not_removed,hahahahhahahahhahahahahahah loses comes here to cry never gets old cya mate
2007scape,not_removed,youre just asking to get screwed over doing nonmaxed staking the people youre staking dont have the stats you think they have
2007scape,not_removed,also where you said its a breach of consumer laws please remember that at the end of the day you do not own your account or items jagex owns itthem and they can do with it as they please whether professional or not
2007scape,not_removed,flame all you like im asking the question if youve ever staked for long periods of time youd know its a legitimate one
2007scape,not_removed,fixt
2007scape,not_removed,of particular interest to gamers is increased protection for people who buy digital content if digital goods are faulty consumers are entitled to a full refund or a replacement this is the first time consumers have had clear legal rights for digital content im sure considering that i pay for a membership which provides access to digital content that therefore i am paying for that service directly to jagex and am entitled to full transparency about the product im buying correct
2007scape,not_removed,look look look im quickly typing at work on my phone i can only do so much
2007scape,not_removed,over stakes and im sitting at around wins and losses
2007scape,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 youre just bad 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 am i flaming right
2007scape,not_removed,you could be right although you would have to look through uk laws as far as i know though any online game you play or have an account for you do not actually own it
2007scape,not_removed,where is that quote taken from sounds interesting
2007scape,not_removed,ever sold gold
2007scape,not_removed,if he didnt and what you say is true then he would be better than those losses by rwters would be wins for non rwters
2007scape,not_removed,actually made me chuckle
2007scape,not_removed,it needs to be pink to match the dragon defender then its quite nice i guess
2007scape,not_removed,i take back everything bad i said about that game
2007scape,not_removed,ok
2007scape,not_removed,roasted
2007scape,not_removed,is this ghosts design
2007scape,not_removed,support
2007scape,not_removed,as funny as this may sound i think this could be a damn toggle on for like
2007scape,not_removed,not enough pink
2007scape,not_removed,i doubt it as it would be copyrighted by lucas ltd so they would have to have a license as it is a star wars design
2007scape,not_removed,yah its silly to have any of those ironman references in their name
2007scape,not_removed,cool story bro
2007scape,not_removed,even though u said it in a condescending manner what ur saying is rather true at crowded places most notably dks ill crash either low levels or iron men every world is full im not going to bother crashing someone who can contest kills it makes no sense people are not looking to be assholes when crashing they simply want the resource and have the power to take it
2007scape,not_removed,my favorite is when an ironman is soloing rex on saturday at peak hours and gets pissed when im forced to crash him i mean honestly what do you think is going to happen
2007scape,not_removed,thats y i dont have any hcim or ironman reference in my hcims name l o l
2007scape,not_removed,forced lel
2007scape,not_removed,i guess forced isnt the right word because i could just not but when im maxed on task and have made an honest effort to find my own world im sorry but survival of the fittest
2007scape,not_removed,use bones to bananas tabs
2007scape,not_removed,makes it less afk though also not sure how fast the bones respawn
2007scape,not_removed,fast enough to be fine and the trap take forever​ just pick up a bone then lay the trap and repeat start with 🍌 youll be fine
2007scape,not_removed,just a little joke im sure the servers are thriving
2007scape,not_removed,this cancer lol
2007scape,not_removed,dude have you been praying to i pray every morning before breakfast and i longer have dc problems
2007scape,not_removed,i really liked coming into runescape with no prior knowledge having this massive world at my fingertips was incredibly overwhelming and i loved every second of it
2007scape,not_removed,when the i dont know what to call it the exploratory phase is over you get to learn how to be efficient in ways that matter to you its hard to compare one to the other because they are totally different experiences i think they are trying to recreate this sense of exploration with zeah but it isnt really happening because they are just rehashing mechanics we are all familiar with i think the truth is games were just more fun when you are a kid because you dont know what to expect when i play a new game now even when i havent seen any trailers lets plays streams we they are usually so stale and predictable because every game is just a collection of mechanics and plot elements borrowed from games that ive already played not to say that games arent fun but uh running up walls for example was really fucking cool in assassins creed i was not as impressed by the exact same mechanic in the proceeding assassins creed games and every other fucking action game set in an urban environment made after edit if you arent having as much fun just blow your bank on a skill and then rebuild rs is a lot more fun when you dont have cash or a ton of equipment imo
2007scape,not_removed,being a high total level and going for max and post xp is the most fun ive ever had in rs
2007scape,not_removed,noob was fun since you didnt have to do anything fun just happened though ive had the most fun playing ironman and optimizing my play style and looking back at mistakes and methods ect
2007scape,not_removed,i personally felt sort of helpless as a noob i was a noob up until osrs realistically now i know what to do but im just lazy i think i prefer now all i miss is castle wars and stealing creations
2007scape,not_removed,as much as i liked it it was hella frustrating i remember i mined coal in the dwarf mine for weeks on end selling the ore to the guy in the north of the cave i finally managed to afford a rune pickaxe felt like a bad ass so decided to take a trip to the bh crater i did not have that pickaxe long
2007scape,not_removed,i loved being a noob doing castle wars with all my buddies when we were kids was awesome
2007scape,not_removed,click button to wipe runescape memory
2007scape,not_removed,being a noob was more fun now i just play because its an addictionwhen i first started i thought that initiate armor was the sickest armor ever and all i ever wanted was a dragon longswordnow its likeyou need bandos to be efficient you need zamorakian spear you need abyssal bludgeon wtf r u doing youre wasting xp
2007scape,not_removed,i just like runescape lol
2007scape,not_removed,i still have the most fun grinding out the early levels on new pk builds even though i have a maxed cb zerker and main
2007scape,not_removed,ive made like accounts now that ive all gotten to around total and stopped playing or they got banned im tired of being a fucking noob i want to be maxed again
2007scape,not_removed,thats the word for it overwhelming when we first start out we are thrown in to a crazy large world with not a lot of knowledge or help to go by you just gotta go out on a limb and learn as you go years ago i was learning so much every day and i still am now since returning to the game
2007scape,not_removed,when i play a new game now even when i havent seen any trailers lets plays streams we they are usually so stale and predictable because every game is just a collection of mechanics and plot elements borrowed from games that ive already played you articulated why ive stopped playing video games drastically over the last few years
2007scape,not_removed,thats also why iron man is so popular its taking a game you think you know a lot about but switches it up just enough that everything becomes new and challenging again
2007scape,not_removed,if only
2007scape,not_removed,i think it has a lot to do with the reason why i got to mining before i did anything else major when was released it was my dream goal when i was a noob which i never managed to achieve before i quit
2007scape,not_removed,gold buyer or bond buyer verified lol
2007scape,not_removed,the customer starter pack
2007scape,not_removed,rcutenoobs
2007scape,not_removed,farseer helm for melee wut
2007scape,not_removed,where is this man id gladly get him a fire cape for
2007scape,not_removed,in german it was called lava cape
2007scape,not_removed,farseer helmet amulet of glory t d chain g and finally shayzien legs this guy gets it
2007scape,not_removed,rcutenoobs
2007scape,not_removed,looks photoshopped over his head
2007scape,not_removed,when rwters think money makes you better at the game
2007scape,not_removed,which costume is that
2007scape,not_removed,sounds more like a private server goer
2007scape,not_removed,apparently its feuer kap
2007scape,not_removed,its a magic amulet t and i thought the armor pants looked good along with the ram helmet and the red axe
2007scape,not_removed,and the
2007scape,not_removed,servers with tradeable fire capes torso and defenders are aids
2007scape,not_removed,in most private servers ive played you still had to beat jad for fire cape
2007scape,not_removed,oh well shit now the farseer helmet and magic amulet make sense hes trying to make those new battle mags pures
2007scape,not_removed,ive played out of the i bounced between from that made that a requirement most are from pkpoints or something
2007scape,not_removed,ye i remember one i played jad was in a multicombat area so you had to compete with other players for drops so everyone used full dh for max damage
2007scape,not_removed,devalues the time i peed in a cup on wave
2007scape,not_removed,i fully support this
2007scape,not_removed,they talked about this on stream once they said because of the randomness of raids its not the same sequence every time it would be hard for them to save and resume them in the same way they do with fight caves and such i dont remember if they said it would be too much for the servers to handle or whether they just said it would be hard to pull off though
2007scape,not_removed,yes pleasee lets get this
2007scape,not_removed,id love to be able to actually loot the chest if i dc after olm dies too its really fun wasting mins and supplies for nothing
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,mate this takes the cake
2007scape,not_removed,i thought they updated it so that any loot left in the chest goes in to your private storage next to the bank chest there
2007scape,not_removed,they did
2007scape,not_removed,people on this sub are so pathetic but downvotes aside they didnt fix it if you dc if you dc with the chest open before you can loot it you get nothing also if you dc and everyone leaves the raid before you open chest you get nothing so basically the problem remains
2007scape,not_removed,didnt know that i dced after getting loot but before opening chest and got my loot so assumed they fixed it they really need to fix it for real and not just for one scenario
2007scape,not_removed,rip in dragon darts
2007scape,not_removed,you should ask for compensation since that year membership was yours
2007scape,not_removed,if u were actually going for record i dont think u would beat woox since u didnt have vengtea to not miss any game ticks and max out damage unless u were just going for a personal best
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i wasnt even on task i just figured it would be good to practice off task since once you get the task theres no practicing i have no plan of beating woox lol not without that program of his at least
2007scape,not_removed,been about a week since i could last load the clientlogin official clientkonduitosb all wont load
2007scape,not_removed,open osbuddy go to settings select highway scroll down to europe farm all of the ranarrs your heart desires
2007scape,not_removed,yeah its awesome despite its flaws seasons should be every month
2007scape,not_removed,i speak for myself and many many others when i say the launch and play time of world dmm is the most fun ive ever had on runescape in all the years that ive played this game nothing will ever come close to the early stages the noob days of deadman modes first launch but i think youre mistaken dmm isnt what gets a lot of hate on this post its the lack of jmod intervention that gets hate
2007scape,not_removed,aint nobody got time for that
2007scape,not_removed,nike
2007scape,not_removed,i want this all in me
2007scape,not_removed,from gargoyles wow thats crazy i want to kill them too
2007scape,not_removed,i cant believe you camped gargs with red d vambs instead of a cmb bracelet but i admire your dedication
2007scape,not_removed,tttthnx fore remembering me im gonna buy it tyyyy
2007scape,not_removed,or just quest and get barrows gloves since theyre bis
2007scape,not_removed,dont have time for questing im making daily m drop party every day d
2007scape,not_removed,and prices would drop until again it becomes only worth it for those with fremmy diaries and max gear the only real change is that it would be easier for ironmen and a lot less fun for everyone else grinding constant small profit getting valuable drops dks are an incredibly successful boss obviously with stable prices on the drops and they dont damage the economy why change them
2007scape,not_removed,now try on an ironman lol i just want a bring before slayer
2007scape,not_removed,incoming downvotes
2007scape,not_removed,nice

2007scape,not_removed,antisocial zam
2007scape,not_removed,he wouldnt let me come in his house for it
2007scape,not_removed,i must take my own life zam
2007scape,not_removed,nice lure
2007scape,not_removed,how many ammys and rings did you use
2007scape,not_removed,ive done this method before and it only has dragons people constantly come to the spot and as soon as theres people there you have to wait between kills it could work but only in the dead morning hours
2007scape,not_removed,green dragons have been past years with out the diary nothing new here
2007scape,not_removed,or just tele to ca or corp to do graves drags which has been here since day of osrs u can also burning ammy to lava maze and do drags could also use hunter cape to get there if noobs dont know you can corp to green drags there no hope for them
2007scape,not_removed,if we assume he had inventory spots for loot each trip which is probably on the low side with looting bag then thats about bones a trip bones per trip about trips so one ring of dueling burning amulets feel free to subtract from his profit for that the real interest would be the other supplies he uses each trip but id bet they are inexpensive as well
2007scape,not_removed,its pretty good on pvpskill total worlds and if anyone crashes me i usually just run them off with my main
2007scape,not_removed,burning amulet is the new thing that hasnt existed for two years and teleports you right next to them closer than any other teleport does it speeds it up some
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt know this ty
2007scape,not_removed,the point is you can tele straight to clan wars and heal everything while you bank you cant do that at the dragons you listed sure you can run south and tele but that is slower
2007scape,not_removed,wouldnt it be slots since looting bag takes a slot
2007scape,not_removed,i feel like everyone forgets about the corp cave which is seconds from green dragons
2007scape,not_removed,well now that everybody knows it doesnt anymore there can really only be one person per world without any lost kills now worlds will be impossible to find
2007scape,not_removed,or just use a glorycmb braceslayer ring its only wild levels at graves for duel ring which is significantly less distance than bandit camp to west drags anyways
2007scape,not_removed,is what you can hold with looting bag hence me saying is probably on the low side when i do green drags i have spaces for loot only taking up space with looting bag brews and a super restore eat all the food i bring and i only bring dose pots so those can be dropped leaving spots
2007scape,not_removed,graves teleport is way closer to drags than burning neck too
2007scape,not_removed,thats probably the most use method at least for bots but burning amulet is literally right next to them like seconds max from tele spot and below lvl so you can use your ring of dueling right away to tele definitely a small amount of time but if its seconds each trip then it eventually adds up
2007scape,not_removed,just cant do it at a busy time of the day they were already pretty busy but yeah i definitely agree that it will increase the popularity some plan to try some today and see how it goes
2007scape,not_removed,did it this morning and had no problem finding open world surprised too cuz i thought on a saturday it would definitely be packed
2007scape,not_removed,clans pk outside corp cave and single ppl pk at the graves drags so i like his suggestion im a year vet and didnt know about this burning ammy all the methods listed are good to know about in case one is not viable due to pkers
2007scape,not_removed,looting bag can only hold items
2007scape,not_removed,in the early morning on april fools day peak hours s
2007scape,not_removed,while west drags ia pretty dead around cmb its active with pkers from cmb and graves is like both are really popping
2007scape,not_removed,yeah and your inventory holds making a total of or free spaces cuz of the looting bag
2007scape,not_removed,just thought id let you know since you thought it would be impossible to find a world mb if you dont care tho and in the uk its like pm so prob peak hours there online even tho you just impossible in general not impossible when its busy
2007scape,not_removed,ignore me im autistic i was doing
2007scape,not_removed,ueah theres a lot of people pn rn but thats because everybody is crlebrating april fools not killing drags
2007scape,not_removed,autistic screeching intensifies
2007scape,not_removed,aight ill give you another update in a couple days so you can tell me why that day isnt a good example either matter of fact you must be right its always impossible to find a world saturdays so please dont come out to green drags ever just a waste of time
2007scape,not_removed,no i am saying a holiday is not a good time to find people doing drags and litterally any other day i havent said shit about havent even said shit about saturday just april fools you are using a strawman fallacy to make me seem like a prick but youre the prick
2007scape,not_removed,because i disagree im a prick thanks for the discussion mate have a good one
2007scape,not_removed,you are a prick because you got extremely passive aggressive and are now trying to call that having a discussion
2007scape,not_removed,bro you are trying to tell me that people celebrating april fools is making the game less populated there is people online the most ever on at once is like on a normal weekday there will be like on what you are saying is just ridiculous clearly no way you are changing your mind so i tried to get you to realize what you were saying is ridiculous another way i dont know what was passive aggressive about saying please dont come out to green drags thats just a winwin for me you either go check em out and realize you can find empty worlds or you never go do them and that means one less person doing drags if you still think it is impossible to find a world for green drags and burning amulet doesnt speed them up at all then i dont know what else to say thanks for the prick title tho
2007scape,not_removed,i am not saying that it makes it less populated i am saying less of the people online are at green dragons and yes despite your beleif what you say you did is still passive aggressive i was never doing anything to make you this upset other than making a claim you found ridiculous please quit over reacting and taking everything so personally you call me a prick but any other sane person wether they agree with my opinions and claims or not could see that im not the one repetedly cursing people out telling them to stay away because its better for me strawmanning and displaying extreme passive aggression you are toxic
2007scape,not_removed,good thing you never did anything to make me upset cuz im not upset lol i didnt call anyone a prick you called me one when did i even curse my b for mistakenly being passive aggressive but other than that i have been reasonably polite when replying to you more so than you for calling me a prick for saying something supposedly passive aggressive whatever mate if green drags is too packed for you its too packed idk what else to say hope thats not passive aggressive from experience i know its not so i wasnt going to be changing my mind guess we just have to agree to disagree
2007scape,not_removed,you are very clearly getting too worked up over this i might have been a slight bit rude but your reactions were completely unwarranted and condescending
2007scape,not_removed,aight i edit last comment submitted before i finished typing everything but tbh i view you the exact same way you are describing me right now based on our one small conversation saying shit like completely unwarranted when im being no more ridiculous than you ill take notes on your tact and improve for the future
2007scape,not_removed,the parts im referring to with passive aggressiveness and unwarranted behavior are the parts where you told me not to come because it would be better for you hit me with one of the most passive aggresive sentences ive ever seen in my entire life matter of fact you must be right its always impossible to find a world saturdays so please dont come out to green drags ever just a waste of time and as soon as i mentioned anything about april fools day possibly having an effect you immediately assumed i would be a stubborn asshole you took the aggressive stance first so i called you a prick which you were being
2007scape,not_removed,but how could one less person make a difference if its already impossible to find a world not actually asking that that is my point in saying what i did is that really unwarranted like i already said earlier i tried to show that what you said about it being impossible to find a world was ridiculous since you didnt listen to me with numbers this was all before i knew you thought it had to with people doing different things in the game because of april fools which i still havent seen anything in game to support that but theres no real way to prove that i can think of
2007scape,not_removed,people arent out doing an april fools event they are usually out socializing one of the few days where that is a very popular thing to do is april fools day edit here is where i explained why it was pretty empty yeah theres a lot of people on rn but thats because everybody is celebrating april fools not killing drags you immediately responded with rude passiveaggressiveness in what was previously a normal convo
2007scape,not_removed,rc pkers are like the equivalent of the kids in school who pick fights with the smallestweakest kid since theyd get their ass handed to them against anyone else
2007scape,not_removed,whats this actually from
2007scape,not_removed,pking rcers is just the ultimate just because you can doesnt mean you should example in all of rs sitting around wasting xp just to waste a little of someone elses xp
2007scape,not_removed,fuck i gotta goto work today fml
2007scape,not_removed,not using protect item with fally shield
2007scape,not_removed,how do people find joy in killing rcers or people doing clues i feel like if you are pking its much more profitable and enjoyable actually fighting someone rather than someone who is defence less
2007scape,not_removed,when look at a meme and already know its gonna get over upvotes
2007scape,not_removed,i should dress as a rcer and counter pk all those retards skulling for rcers
2007scape,not_removed,the zamorak mage needs to be updated to not teleport people who are teleblocked its complete nonsense
2007scape,not_removed,stay salty idiot not surprised that every rcer is so shit at this game
2007scape,not_removed,hahaha the salt is hilarious its like taking lunch money from a child also killing rcers is really good loot some people get lazy and dont bank their runes ive killed people with nats on them and some have had eternal glories on them how is it not profitable i dont give a fk if you think this is fun for me or not the reason you rcers can make bank is because of how damn easy it is to make nats because the abyss is so close to bank the only tradeoff is that its lvls into the wildly might as well whine as to why we dont have a rune rock by the ditch my god stop whinning
2007scape,not_removed,i love killing people rcing their sweet salty tears is what keeps me motivated to kill more
2007scape,not_removed,so if a pvper kills you in a pvp zone hes an asshole
2007scape,not_removed,k
2007scape,not_removed,itt people dont understand the point of the wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,hahahahahahhahaahahahaha
2007scape,not_removed,i hope i am tall enough to ride this train to the top choo chooooo all aboard the meme train
2007scape,not_removed,im usually handing them afterwards if i find them in edgeville congratulating them to the achievement that they have done pityfull beings
2007scape,not_removed,most of these pkers are plebs too i have got pkd times where times i tanked and tp to abyss other i got back and started pking them where one of the guy tp away and other one was sucessful kill only guy really showed resistance of some kind im cb
2007scape,not_removed,why would you think that people who enjoy rc pking want a challenge sometimes you want to play games on easy enjoying different things doesnt mean youre autistic or have issues it keeps surprising me that people get mad over being killed in a place thats designed to kill other people how dare they waste xp having fun they should be like me obsessing over gphr and efficiency
2007scape,not_removed,stay salty makes the kills all the more sweeter
2007scape,not_removed,if you wanna be safe you should do lava runes 🇳igga
2007scape,not_removed,you can search texas helicopter pig hunt or something like that on youtube for the original video
2007scape,not_removed,and every time someone says its an asshole thing to do they respond with you should be prepared to die when going to wildy like sure but what does that have to do with it being an asshole thing to do
2007scape,not_removed,not everything in this game revolves around xp i think people forget that this is a game in the first place rc pkers are having fun id imagine
2007scape,not_removed,killed a guy for an obby sheild the other day then another guy for a rune pick theres some loot to be found out there
2007scape,not_removed,i usually risk about every time i do a clue in wildy so worth a shot taking me out
2007scape,not_removed,they get so mad its so funny
2007scape,not_removed,i think you were wrong
2007scape,not_removed,please make a video about it
2007scape,not_removed,so youre just an asshole nice
2007scape,not_removed,i mean the wildy is made for killing people but if pissing off people turns you on you might have a small psychological problem
2007scape,not_removed,is it really that entertaining if i get killed abyss crafting i loose like seconds and a glory it really is no big deal to me only time i might be annoyed is if i had just popped a stamina idk to me it just seems like being given a trophy for hitting a bullseye at meter but hey to each their own no real inconvience to me you get to kill people its a winwin in my book
2007scape,not_removed,me too the tears are the best loot
2007scape,not_removed,no this has been explained times dragon throwing axe is worth more than the glory they will pk so theyre essentially retarded and picking on defenseless people for nothing not even profit
2007scape,not_removed,jfc guy
2007scape,not_removed,its a joke u autistic child
2007scape,not_removed,you probably overestimate how much a single death means i have probaly been killed skilling a few times mostly on dmm its just part of the game for me
2007scape,not_removed,i like the attenpt at avoiding his point
2007scape,not_removed,jokes on you i bring a law rune a dust rune a crude chair and a rope the law rune and dust rune are to teleport to my house the crude chair and rope are to let you know you should go kill yourself
2007scape,not_removed,call him salty all you want but theres a reason you are pking runecrafters and not other pkers youre a sad pathetic child seeking validation hell never get
2007scape,not_removed,says the kid who probably smashes his possessions after dying once
2007scape,not_removed,dont even have to do lavas to be safe considering how ass glory pkers are
2007scape,not_removed,who you talkin to lil ni🅱️🅱️a
2007scape,not_removed,or just get a quest cape for zero risk crafting nats
2007scape,not_removed,savage good meme
2007scape,not_removed,uhh i thought it was a tank shooting some little rodent in the bushes
2007scape,not_removed,im pretty sure they are more prepared to die than the guys attacking them too i mean its not like anyone is risk rcing they generally fuck off after killing someone for fear of retribution
2007scape,not_removed,rc in wildy little do they know i have dclaws
2007scape,not_removed,sorry but wilderness is not a safe zone for you special snowflakes
2007scape,not_removed,if killing rcers is the worst of your psychological problems then youre doing pretty good imo
2007scape,not_removed,perhaps we should look into the idea of requiring a risk to rc in the abyss increasing both the profits of rcers and rc pkers
2007scape,not_removed,who pks for profit majority of pkers lose money or break even its for fun
2007scape,not_removed,everyone who has fun is essentially retarded
2007scape,not_removed,its not for nothing its for fun that still exists in game
2007scape,not_removed,yep every single rc pker uses d thrown axes
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot xp waste and profit is all thst matters in rs anymore forgot that fucking around for shits and giggles is pointless now adays
2007scape,not_removed,imagine being this mad when you die in the wilderness
2007scape,not_removed,you concluded that because i kill people on a game ok i kill both for the record
2007scape,not_removed,how so scrub asking
2007scape,not_removed,no its real wild hogs are a horrible problem down here they are tearing through farm land and property like crazy sometimes killing cattle and livestock as well as vegetation roads and fences they are breeding out of control no matter how many we kill
2007scape,not_removed,yep always used to be good shit when a retard would stand there in max killing rc pkers in but as soon as somebody that was rcing gears in max and goes to fight they tab out lmao
2007scape,not_removed,rc in wildy little do they know i dont have autism
2007scape,not_removed,what if i told you that you can follow the rules and be an asshole at the same time
2007scape,not_removed,enjoy the glory i guess
2007scape,not_removed,aye i said a small problem
2007scape,not_removed,based on the comments on this post it seems if its xp wasting then its not fun
2007scape,not_removed,people dont realize this is a game they treat it like its their job
2007scape,not_removed,haha its so fun to ruin others game experience xd what if i have fun attacking people with crystal bow repeatedly in a pvp world haha just fun right
2007scape,not_removed,well i mean i think its hilarious to rag pkers with a crystal bow but they ban me for having that fun yet yall faggots can rag me all day like cop a terminal disease
2007scape,not_removed,mad at what i dont lose anything and i get to humiliate an idiot
2007scape,not_removed,quest cape teleports you to legends guild which is near a fairy ring you use that to get to the nat altar and it takes almost the same amount of time as an abyss run like maybe or ticks longer
2007scape,not_removed,sounds like americans
2007scape,not_removed,commenting on reddit little do they know im compensating
2007scape,not_removed,the abyss is in the wilderness for a reason
2007scape,not_removed,yes if its fun for you and not breaking any game rules then go ahead and do it
2007scape,not_removed,so when you rag do you ever intend to kill them cause rc pkers tend to want to kill their target btw i dont rc pk i just dont get why people complain about when its put in the wilderness to add to the risk the abyss is an amazing rc training method and its balanced with that little bit of risk
2007scape,not_removed,humiliate youre the one in lumbridge have fun regearing
2007scape,not_removed,sigh reads quest guides 🙁
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,you mean putting on a few pieces of graceful and a pickaxe lol
2007scape,not_removed,but he didnt die he tped away
2007scape,not_removed,im loving the pussy balls
2007scape,not_removed,have fun with that crude chair and rope
2007scape,not_removed,they are tearing through farm land and property like crazy sometimes killing cattle and livestock as well as vegetation roads and fences yea thats amerifats
2007scape,not_removed,its funny how you rcers act like you dont care yet if you truly didnt care you wouldnt be here arguing you are the best people to kill for this reason it amuses me how irritated you get
2007scape,not_removed,yeah you sure got me
2007scape,not_removed,someones late on the fat america memes thats old now dude
2007scape,not_removed,at least we dont have eu teeth
2007scape,not_removed,i dont really rc much only but ive never been pkd because of my level bracket im not really arguing i just think its funny people try to defend pking someone for an glory and then acting all high and mighty about it i promise im not irritated hahha just bored in class reading comments gl on those pks though lol
2007scape,not_removed,lol if you actually sit there and kill rcers because it amuses you it further proves the rc pker stereotype lol
2007scape,not_removed,how much do you spend per kill on rcers you need an entangle spell and a tb spell bare minimum entangle casts cost minimum tb casts cost so you are spending to get and some essence you wont pick up and that is before you even add in splashing those spells and usage of offensive spells range ammo and pots
2007scape,not_removed,spoken like a true fat american
2007scape,not_removed,i mean pking isnt always about the monetary loot and thats what im trying to say half the reason people kill rcers is for the saltbut yeah i know that its pretty scummy though
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think ive ever met a pker who doesnt kill for fun
2007scape,not_removed,people dont pk rcers for money
2007scape,not_removed,got like a bank so dont care about the cost
2007scape,not_removed,no u
2007scape,not_removed,ive also never met a pker who will fight someone who protects all their valuables and only drops black dhide chaps showing that obviously its majority about what you get from the kill
2007scape,not_removed,the fun comes from a good fight tho not from just killing someone just to kill them
2007scape,not_removed,is this a joke lol
2007scape,not_removed,you and everyone you know will be permed if u commit these atrocities
2007scape,not_removed,they might try and ban all the accounts under your ip
2007scape,not_removed,yes
2007scape,not_removed,possibly cause its goldfarming not sure though but not worth the risk lol
2007scape,not_removed,no you will be fine go ahead and do it
2007scape,not_removed,bot farmers tend to use mules to switch between accounts not exactly sure how it works maybe they just trade it several times to different ips and it becomes too hard to trace i definitely know there are botting programs specifically designed as mules to counteract this potential for banning though
2007scape,not_removed,yes for sure
2007scape,not_removed,dead serious bruv
2007scape,not_removed,sarcasm or serious tho
2007scape,not_removed,bot farmers use vpns and proxies so that each account appears under a different ip making it hard to ban the gold farmers main accountgold stash
2007scape,not_removed,yes accounts associated with bot accounts do frequently get banned alongside the bots and for good reason too
2007scape,not_removed,are you being for super cereal
2007scape,not_removed,dude nice zulrah luck
2007scape,not_removed,insane luck dude
2007scape,not_removed,ridic man ty for posting to reddit
2007scape,not_removed,i give u for it
2007scape,not_removed,the beginning of the end of dmm

2007scape,not_removed,then mazhar gets killed by ac
2007scape,not_removed,how severe is it
2007scape,not_removed,this is not a dating website
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,yes its still the same
2007scape,not_removed,someone has been watching too much game of thrones
2007scape,not_removed,just so this doesnt seem like a one trick pony another event theme could involve building a dark arkanum in zeah which would ifwhen complete would allow players to use corrupted prayers such as vampiric essence life steal transformation magic wolf form wraith ghost and more it would be a halloween special event and all changes would be temporary but the dark arkanum would remain and be a launching point for quests in the future this one is a little bit more ambitious
2007scape,not_removed,i personally like the memes
2007scape,not_removed,i enjoyed looking through these rip the sgs
2007scape,not_removed,thought id share some swiftkit screenshots taken over the years from old school posting around of them but ive got a little over screenshots in all i posted some pictures a few days ago but i felt like sharing more of them so if youre bored with nothing to do and some time to spare you could look at all these if you want p
2007scape,not_removed,lost all my bones and shiit
2007scape,not_removed,did i just see sailing
2007scape,not_removed,those are some fucking memories i am so sad i never took any screenshots of my maxed pure back in i have other screenshots from just none of my pure i looked thru each and every picnice man just nice

2007scape,not_removed,i wish this was still a thing httpiimgurcomftpbcmqpng finding rares felt awesome and they were worth something
2007scape,not_removed,i miss the rare time spawning this way better than mods spamming them would like to see that brought back with some new ones tbh
2007scape,not_removed,very nice mate its great to see someone else journey in the game we all love so much i have all my old osb screenshots on an external hard drive from day and theyre so nostalgic
2007scape,not_removed,totally saw you at redwoods last night awesome album man

2007scape,not_removed,arent u that dude from frhd
2007scape,not_removed,pretty fucking nice i scrolled slowly til the very end making sure i read everything one thing id like to know is whats your pures name i have one myself but just like you im skilling a lot on it hopefully maxing eventually minus for defense attack and pray and fighting for highscores during the early days of a game is always fun i guess thats why i played hundreds of new private servers lol
2007scape,not_removed,literally looked at every picture lol makes me wanna get out of bed and play runescape but im an ironman
2007scape,not_removed,dude you made me miss osrs so much such good times in the early days ❤️ty
2007scape,not_removed,i hate when i lose all my bones and shiit
2007scape,not_removed,april fools event a few years ago
2007scape,not_removed,pretty much had as much time as i wanted but now its limited as of january p
2007scape,not_removed,he meant to click a battlestaff just afk slayer i guess
2007scape,not_removed,ya
2007scape,not_removed,mudvayne
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,whats the story with finding random rares
2007scape,not_removed,go for xp every skill
2007scape,not_removed,booooorrrrrrrringgggggggggg
2007scape,not_removed,i always pray flicked my tasks back then and i was just trying to click too fast i guess and there were no alch warnings
2007scape,not_removed,dont you get a warning message if you try to alch something expensive
2007scape,not_removed,upon release they would randomly spawn a few times per day in very random places ie middle of myreditch ardy farm patch top of desert treasure pyramid the hallways of the slayer tower etc you could make like by finding one laying around in the middle of no where lots of people would camp the better spots and made mills doing so it was a fun community event ccs formed for it
2007scape,not_removed,you do now but it didnt use to be a thing wouldve saved my ass
2007scape,not_removed,they should make it like normal pvp worlds no xp loss no bank keys
2007scape,not_removed,i agree that would be cool too
2007scape,not_removed,whats the point on that its deadman mode not pvp world
2007scape,not_removed,lasts for only months and that battke royale at the end
2007scape,not_removed,then play 😒
2007scape,not_removed,well nope
2007scape,not_removed,damn
2007scape,not_removed,nice man
2007scape,not_removed,grats im at kc and have yet to get mine
2007scape,not_removed,update on the task lmao
2007scape,not_removed,from what ive read the issue is for clans vs clans the team of can repeatedly come back nonstop for hours while losing nothing each time with a high chance of koing at least person doesnt matter how good your armour is or agsballistas will kill you on the other hand each person in the geared clan loses a lot of wealth each time they die and gearing up to come back takes longer while they also get nothing in return for coming back since the dont drop anything its basically impossible to actually clear a clan even though your gear is way better so basically the issue is that its no longer worth it for clans to bring real gear to multi what the wildy needs is either a new way or improve an existing way to get the of people who are or prevent from being able to just repeatedly come back with no risk for as long as they want
2007scape,not_removed,i dont pkdo wildy bosses personally so i dont care but the reason people are mad is thisthe dspear used to prevent agssballistas main issue from being in multi as often you now have an extremely high chance of being by a group of people when doing bosses or pking in multi areas
2007scape,not_removed,team with ancient maces need to smite itemers
2007scape,not_removed,exactly multi is aids doesnt matter if its guys iteming or guys in rune mystic dhide tribrid you get piled you die
2007scape,not_removed,people with item ags vs people in mysticsdhide
2007scape,not_removed,from what i understand it was never the case that these long lasting clan wars had clan members using even remotely decent gear i distinctly remember bulerik using yak hide or some shet during these long lasting wars all the d spear change does is make it so instead of bullerik using addy scim he will prob opt for a agszgs i feel like this would spice up clan wars if anything it will always be better to have yak hide essentially no arm in regards to coin worth over nothing the interesting thing is that now clans have the opportunities to smite these weapons and make some sort of profit off clan wars i think if anything that this is a positive change for clan wars
2007scape,not_removed,but like i said if you get piled by a team then you are almost certainly going to die regardless no
2007scape,not_removed,i am almost certain that deep wildymulti pking will continue where it left off a rag tag team of d spears isnt what made the wildy the wildy if anything it restricted it solo playerssmall teams would never bring high end weapons to deep wildy for this reason
2007scape,not_removed,have you seen the dbows max hit once
2007scape,not_removed,problem is theyd then have to check each report manually taking a lot of time
2007scape,not_removed,do they not do that already i assume theres some automation initially to see if it detects something but i feel like theyd need to be somewhat hands on to ensure accuracy
2007scape,not_removed,supply and demand
2007scape,not_removed,slayer blog later
2007scape,not_removed,rcutenoobs
2007scape,not_removed,funny thing is most of the people who post there are around lvl themselves
2007scape,not_removed,underrated post we need this plz for the love of god
2007scape,not_removed,sign in to you can sort the list there
2007scape,not_removed,are the rewards still stuck at just gp i was extremely hype for this mini until i read that ive never been a big duel arena person and this just feels like glorified staking to me
2007scape,not_removed,you cant really compare them because everybody loves early game dmm its the accumulated progress that makes people abandon it and keeps new players away i honestly think the general idea of lms is perfect in a sense that it takes both skill and rng so it wont be the same people winning every time the games improved though with each beta and i expect it to keep improving before release
2007scape,not_removed,people gonna go for them cash prizes tbh isnt a lot to enter and is a lot to a lot of people in this game
2007scape,not_removed,it does seem that jagex is trying to rush it given that this is apparently the final beta it is unreasonable to expect them to solve all of the problems before this and release especially given that the problems will require player input to determine if they are fixed within a reasonable degree of acceptance its going to need another beta
2007scape,not_removed,dmm was not a failure at all it bought loads of people back and the early game hype is fun as hell just needs to be toned down to stay early game for a bit longer
2007scape,not_removed,there is nothing you can do to improve it its a shit minigame with shit rewards spend dev time on stealing creation
2007scape,not_removed,potentially gaining over a mil in under minutes this game mode wont die out
2007scape,not_removed,why couldnt they just improve fight pits
2007scape,not_removed,worth reading my lms vision in the lms lobby area before you actually pay the there should be an interface you can use to select a gear loadout from a pool of items you dont need to have these items in the main game and these pool of items are capped at d scim msb and ancient staff for weapons no poisonvenom tho fuck that shit its cancer and def armor for gear mystic rune blackdhide stuff like ddefender berserker ring bgloves all would be in there for ko potentialinfinite of runesarrows available similar to tourney worlds but with a gear cap you can stuff in as many sharks and as many ppots super att super str staminas and range pots as youd like by sacrificing switches that you could have brought instead brews would not be in here you will also be allowed to select your spellbook here after you start a game you are brought to the island in a random location with your gear loadout there are no chests on this island aside from bloody chest at the center of every area that had chests before these will work differently there will be shoptokens still but they will only have sharks and pots sup attsup strrangeppotsstaminas in there ill explain later the fog will work like it already does pushing people to one location now if you kill someone you will still get a bloody key instead of just using the key on the chest the chest will require you to deposit gear item just use the item on the chest and after doing that you can claim an upgraded version of that item by using your key on it ie rune legs dharoks legs mystic top ahrims top ancient staff sotd msb rcb d scim whip dhide top karils top etc etc emphasis on this part would be no rng from bloody keys you claim it knowing what youre gonna get back upon killing someone you will get all their loot as usual and since youll probably be messed up in terms of supplies youll be able to sell their items to the shop to use to claim more supplies you will also be immune to freeze effects for seconds after you kill someone so people dont just camp around fights with ancients hoping for free loot as theyd be able to block them from making it to the shops people brawl it out at the end with their upgraded gear until person is the victor all in all very little rng at the start everyone starts off on the same footing bloody keys wont be rng overhead tribrid dms most skill reqd when pking on rs good pkers will win the majority of their games vs unskilled players and their fate wont be denied within the first minute of the game based on their spawn lms rating can be used when determining matchmaking so people will actually fight others around their skill bracket instead of getting smoked all the time by good pkers good pkers will have a challenging game to play since theyll get paired with the better ppl nothing above will ever see the main game because memers control the game and people are so set on bench marking that it will never see real change they gave everyone oak bows mith scims and fire strike people said what about better gearnot too crazy just something better they give us maple bows addy scims fire bolt people realize there still isnt any skill suggest even more gear upgrades they give us msbs whips master wands people realize that its still too rng based but they dont care and end the beta after this week if they released the game mode as i envision it for a week most good pk streamers would jump straight onto that shit and the hype around the game mode would be high and feedback would just be small changes where certain situations are iffy but theyve handled feedback in small small steps and started the game mode balancing from the bottom up this was originally posted by rahzam i completely agree and was hoping for a similar minigame that hes pictured here let me know what you think and also what you think of the current lms in comparison to this thanks
2007scape,not_removed,lms has improved a lot and i expect it will continue to improve if it proves popular we could see further expansions and updates to it in the future the same could be said if it dies out to revive it i dont expect it to suffer the same issues as dmm though deadman required you to grind up stats and build wealth just to risk it all to a single death and if you fell behind it was very hard to catch up last man standing has no grinding since everyone is given the same stats and even if you have a bad round you can just try again
2007scape,not_removed,i find lms to be more fun than dmm because of the no loss of progress factor but indeed it has a lot of room for improvement if i had to pay for game i wouldnt play it because its so easy to be unlucky with items
2007scape,not_removed,i agree dmm is just a totally forgotten game mode i think the j mods planned to kinda replace dmm with lms but i dont think it will if they put the time and energy that they placed into lms into dmm i think they could make a terrific game they just have some retarded dogmatic beliefs such as not wanting to block content like zulrah and gwd behind time walls or level locks removing xp loss on death or reducing it more heavily this is the main reason why people quit its telling that they havent mentioned dmm once this season after the first week they havent proposed any changes at all the most feedback ive seen given to jagex was a stream by faux with ronan in his spare time this is inadequate give out surveys to dmm players hold a skype group session with many top dmm players get rs players into the offices testing suites to see how they get on the dev team seems content at time to just generate updates for the sake of keeping up appearances i want them to really make radical changes to make dmm great again if they release lms next week as planned it will be a short term financial success but an overall failure stop putting short term profits before making an excellent game
2007scape,not_removed,idk why on the fucking earth stealing creation keeps getting smacked back like wtf just tweak the fucking rewards and give it back
2007scape,not_removed,but dmm is an esport and huge success you could put a prize tag on any competition and it will get viewers i bet there would be as many people watching who woodcuts most xp in hour as there was in dmm tournament
2007scape,not_removed,the idea is that there is some level of skill to lms so it works as a pvp minigame rather than straight up odds
2007scape,not_removed,the only reason dmm early game was fun was because knew what they were doing average nolifer didnt have ancients till weeks in this last seasonal people had ancients with barrage day
2007scape,not_removed,early dmm is only hyped because of the swap rates
2007scape,not_removed,plus you can win games and still profit
2007scape,not_removed,lmao you think dmm wasnt a failure
2007scape,not_removed,you should of posted the link rather than copy pasta
2007scape,not_removed,literally every comment you make is the exact same
2007scape,not_removed,its called clanmanmode not deadmanmode
2007scape,not_removed,or dont tweak the rewards and give it back it was never efficient to do sc instead of just miningwcfletching but it did break up the monotony and made it a lot more fun i think it would appeal to people who play the game to have fun not to collect ehp the same with ba i would play the crap out of ba in order to get extra agility exp even if its not the fastest exphr because i enjoy minigames more than running in circles its just more fun for people like me
2007scape,not_removed,i bet there would be as many people watching who woodcuts most xp in hour as there was in dmm tournament nope
2007scape,not_removed,skill you mean the chance you get a good spawn with good chest loots no one will use their actual money to play this in its current form when its extremely likely to get completely boned from rng from the start also they should just remove the fog or make it enter way later its aids as fuck fighting for mins or something getting a full invo full of gear then not being able to trade it in to the shrine cuz the fog comes in way too early
2007scape,not_removed,i think early dmm is hyped because most people literally are not good enough to pk in fights where they are fighting people using equally viable or better builds but in the early game a lot of them feel like they can get a leg up on the competition and find success anyway that and how punishing deaths are late game
2007scape,not_removed,swap rates only exist because players enjoy early game dmm content
2007scape,not_removed,i think jagex would pull the plug on the thousand dollars if it was a failure
2007scape,not_removed,lmao you think your comment is relevant
2007scape,not_removed,not really this is very different from my other comments on lms since it mostly compared it to dmm than discussing it alone
2007scape,not_removed,no one asked for your shit opinion keep flaming dmm with every comment well just keep ignoring you s
2007scape,not_removed,boned from rng duel arenas quite popular
2007scape,not_removed,the worst is when safe zone is liberty if you arent on the mountain by like mins you will have to tank fog to get there after mins rip your food
2007scape,not_removed,thats for the tournament which brings in thousands of viewers pretty simple to understand that have you seen the of people on twitch watching dmm when the final is on has nothing to do with dmm gameplay last season lasted days
2007scape,not_removed,ignore yagami hes the one who comments the same thing every time and is insecure we appreciate your feedback and insight
2007scape,not_removed,who is we
2007scape,not_removed,what duel arena is or close enough to it lms you can literally spawn and get chests and get nothing
2007scape,not_removed,probably of this subreddit if i had to guess
2007scape,not_removed,exactly both scenarios are rng
2007scape,not_removed,so of this subreddit specifically asked me this lol runescape community is ridiculous thats why all the top players have mental illnesses its literally a requirement
2007scape,not_removed,errrr no not at all duel arena you have a percent chance of winning every time lms you can literally have chance at winning based on how unlucky you are at the beginning youll literally get a good spawn with chests and good loot from them probably out of games see the difference
2007scape,not_removed,are you trying to say duel arena isnt rng because you could literally use the statement about lms to talk about boxing just replace chests with big hits
2007scape,not_removed,did you even read my response everything in this game is rng from hits to drops the difference is in duel arena you have a chance to win every time in lms you could literally play matches and get fucked by spawns or loot and have chance theres a huge difference
2007scape,not_removed,im just confused because you say rng will make the game unpopular yet the whole game is rng i dont see the relevance of it not being because after all its not so it would be quite stupid for it to be especially considering how much more there is to gain from winning a lms match than the duel arena please also avoid using these patronizing respones
2007scape,not_removed,i never said it should be for lms just thats what duel arena is so they arent really comparable im just confused because you say rng will make the game unpopular youre paying money for a good chance that you get an unlucky spawn and get chests a beginner wand and a maple shortbow vs someone getting a good spawn and getting chests and a d scim and rune armor you could realistically spend hundreds of thousands of gold on lms without having a fair chance at winning based on the rng of spawnschest loots thats the problem
2007scape,not_removed,this is so fucking slimey should be punishable imo
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt make sense why would it be muteable sure thing it is annoying but its not harmfuloffensivewhatever
2007scape,not_removed,its not breaking any rules its not scamming theyre literally asking for money no one is forcing anyone to give anything to them no one is in danger of loosing any items or loosing their accounts if they do decide to give them money
2007scape,not_removed,ban all beggars
2007scape,not_removed,ive seen a guu wearing that kind of gear asking for and his name was along the lines of
2007scape,not_removed,was a mistake showing your run energy gf acc
2007scape,not_removed,i think the saddest part is that people still actually give them money or else why would they continue begging means it worked before right
2007scape,not_removed,some could view it as disruptive but even thats a grey area honestly
2007scape,not_removed,of the time the better is an alt of a lazy noob who cant be bothered playing the game to get money
2007scape,not_removed,this guy has alot of friends you can tell
2007scape,not_removed,yeah thats the worth part so fucking sad
2007scape,not_removed,theyre not saying it currently breaks the rules theyre saying it should be against the rules you know an amendment to the rules like look at the title can begging be muteable implies that it isnt but the writer wants it to be as for who gives a shit the vast majority of this sub which is why its always on the fp
2007scape,not_removed,yup he definitely has alot of friends do kids tease you godofennui sorry bud
2007scape,not_removed,hang yourself pls
2007scape,not_removed,this shouldnt be against the rules as it doesnt affect anyones gameplay in any way its an mmo not a single player rpg part of the mmo experience is the social aspect this is a social aspect its the same reason racismscamingstanding near emily is banned not necessarily direct game mechanics but social aspects that are negative and thus policed
2007scape,not_removed,thank you somene who actually understands it
2007scape,not_removed,evidence straw poll as a start if we get any shit tier gear from raids i really dont care this however the age spear c will be worth obtaining for its special attack will be identical to the dragon spear c and have higher accuracy vs corp stab than zamorakian spear age spear like dragon spear will not now or ever have a hasta form
2007scape,not_removed,richer get richer at corp smh
2007scape,not_removed,should i post the loot from years of osrs hell that i compiled over the weekend
2007scape,not_removed,rc trees will level you up quickly enough o
2007scape,not_removed,tithe farming is inefficient apparently i did it just to get to or farming i forget last week and it was alright pretty sure plantingreplanting calquats or palms is better than it but if you just want farming then hell no just plant papayas or palms everyday and willowswatermelonsherbs unless you just want to go hard and plant yews or something
2007scape,not_removed,it will take you way longer to get rc you can just blow your bank to get farming pretty quick if you want
2007scape,not_removed,everyone has an ugly past
2007scape,not_removed,holy fuck this is a good one
2007scape,not_removed,lmfao oh man dude
2007scape,not_removed,dank
2007scape,not_removed,quantum eoc
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,bacula i thought you said blackula like a black vampire
2007scape,not_removed,buy buy buy
2007scape,not_removed,priceless
2007scape,not_removed,lol
2007scape,not_removed,mods are on holiday give it a week
2007scape,not_removed,this
2007scape,not_removed,osbuddy released an update which basically makes it so you can connect through a proxy i havent lagged since i connected through the european one works like a charm
2007scape,not_removed,shit really is there a guide to this lol if this is true and a party program has got a workaround before the actual company has
2007scape,not_removed,all you need to do is turn it on no guide required
2007scape,not_removed,haha jagex is a joke if this works just watched a youtube guide on how to work the vpn to get into osb giving it a go now
2007scape,not_removed,well they have reasons to not make an official vpn and even the osbuddy developer said this is more of a workaround and not a real fix ddosing isnt easy shit to fix
2007scape,not_removed,you dont have to use a vpn you just have to select which region you want as a proxy from on osb its on the very first thing on the settings page
2007scape,not_removed,if the fix is going to take a week and a work around is possible give it to us
2007scape,not_removed,just logged in with minimal lag thankyou so much my man
2007scape,not_removed,yea no problem
2007scape,not_removed,these are the type of posts a hacker would make please disable the safety please lol
2007scape,not_removed,contact a jmod over twitter i would give some but i am pretty braindead sorry
2007scape,not_removed,youre going to have to use account recovery without access to email or authenticator if possible
2007scape,not_removed,lol but i have my username and password i even have the associated emails login info but since i having logged in in a long time it wants security question answers i dont remember those and a new phone so its not the same google authenticate thing lol its like a lol account i really wanna get back into it
2007scape,not_removed,cool will do thanks
2007scape,not_removed,alright thanks
2007scape,not_removed,goodluck my man
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,i think those stats would wreck any pure and any balanced pker youd be fighting would give a good fight but it would def be antipure for sure
2007scape,not_removed,combat bracelet barrows gloves you mean
2007scape,not_removed,decent but you wont hit on rune
2007scape,not_removed,do an initiate pure hardly anyone does em anymore but they wreck face still id keep it attack since claws are coming
2007scape,not_removed,youd be free loot
2007scape,not_removed,this build would get absolutely rocked by any pure his level his pure counterpart would be range atk str or range atk str
2007scape,not_removed,right barrows gloves
2007scape,not_removed,nobody uses them anymore because outside of the clan scene poundforpound they fall short to and defence everywhere except maybe nh bridding
2007scape,not_removed,i dont pk thats just what i figured would happen youre probably right
2007scape,not_removed,see i figured the same thinguntil i actually watched this build fight pures it was quite the opposite
2007scape,not_removed,it isnt used anymore because the slayer helm isnt protected on death due to the untradable update
2007scape,not_removed,sorry but in todays pk meta a zerk without veng isnt going to outdps a pure
2007scape,not_removed,anymore being without statiusvestahandcannoncurses anything between and defence is garbage in comparison
2007scape,not_removed,his guides are the best
2007scape,not_removed,the best
2007scape,not_removed,i love me some hq rips
2007scape,not_removed,honestly i dont care because those people are dumb enough to lend money to a staker they know exactly what the risks are when they do this
2007scape,not_removed,this is why you dont lend money to stakers tbh if jagex really wanted to clean the game up rwt scamming botting etc removing the duel arena would also remove a ton of shady activity that occurs in the game im not really saying that they should its just that it would definitely have a positive result if they did
2007scape,not_removed,i personally think its weird how you can have your own money lose at the duel arena and then take from somebody else to quickly grab back your and as you say this has been going on for x amount of time with this guy he can easily take another and double up to pay back it should not be in the nature of the game to take any money and stake it was a bannable offence and people were getting banned for taking money and staking at one point but then people twisted the rules skill specs and this guy from what ive seen probably loads of others too they changed it to taking a loan and indefinitely paying back these people personally think jagex should not allow streamers taking money to stake with it causes too many problems not only streamers but those that do not stream as well
2007scape,not_removed,i have a hint fore u he dont pay it back
2007scape,not_removed,he doesnt need to pay it back and he wont even if it makes him shitty people giving him money are idiots
2007scape,not_removed,it might have a black market effect using party gambling websites like the one fishy owns which doesnt necessarily solve the problem
2007scape,not_removed,try google
2007scape,not_removed,i was playing earlier around central had really bad ping then i lost connection twice
2007scape,not_removed,happened to me three times on i was simultaneously playing on with no dcs
2007scape,not_removed,yeah ive had multiple accounts all disconnect so i just hop world as it was certainly not my internet i have wasted around at nmz from these dcs stop using nmz when servers are unstable
2007scape,not_removed,however ardy tele tabs troll tabs digsite etc you cant use unless you have finished the quest the teleports and thus teletabs are unlockable content no you should have not have everything given to you just because you chose to limit your account this would be a huge help for skillers and maybe pures that cant do certain quests to keep their build know what also would be a huge help for skillers and pures questing and levelling all of their stats
2007scape,not_removed,the point of the teletab is to save space on runes not to let you by pass quests
2007scape,not_removed,that would harm pures actually their limitation have a purpose
2007scape,not_removed,lol it was super zoomed out at first and i thought you sold a sapphire for
2007scape,not_removed,idk maybe because arcane is over now for raids
2007scape,not_removed,impatience at its best
2007scape,not_removed,remember the coins smh
2007scape,not_removed,very nice man good flip
2007scape,not_removed,i got my mages book for that much😂😂
2007scape,not_removed,aod was just released in but i cant think of anything related to the shield
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,i thought it was a mith plate on my phone
2007scape,not_removed,that means there are more of these available
2007scape,not_removed,blue dhide body for me
2007scape,not_removed,it also means theyre in high demand since theyd be best to arcane for mage slot in raids
2007scape,not_removed,mith chain here
2007scape,not_removed,mages book is better
2007scape,not_removed,malediction ward here
2007scape,not_removed,wtf are you blind or something
2007scape,not_removed,ive been stuck eating only lobsters for a while so it may have blurred my vision
2007scape,not_removed,brb korean maplestory
2007scape,not_removed,lmao you can tell how much you were shaking from watching the cursor youll get it next time edit also make sure to brew up over your max hp next time before starting jad jad maxes i think and you should land somewhere between hp
2007scape,not_removed,ah the panic i know that feel you will get it next time
2007scape,not_removed,jad always spawns on the yellow mage
2007scape,not_removed,i like how jad turns to walk away after killing you as if saying pathetic have an upvote
2007scape,not_removed,i like how jad just walked away all casually lol
2007scape,not_removed,my suggest is use sounds next time keep pray range on at first if you dont know where its going to spawn an if your hear mage attack change your prayer
2007scape,not_removed,lol usuc
2007scape,not_removed,death taxes and people not being able to kill jad in
2007scape,not_removed,what a fucking moron it looks like you literally tried to die on purpose lmao
2007scape,not_removed,was repeating this in my head when i opened these comments
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,thats what i tried on my first attempt but the switching prayer sounds mixed with the mage and range sounds and it messed me up and i died i honestly think i can do it but the message at the bottom distracted me and i didnt see the start of the attack
2007scape,not_removed,i thought it was stalled bc of the message so i hit it and saw his feet coming down which looked like range theres no way to practice this ive literally never fought jad except once before
2007scape,not_removed,why you such a douche
2007scape,not_removed,i just died very similarly a couple hours ago its crazy how if youre even a second too late the damage will hit through your prayer im gonna kill that fucker tomorrow haha and im sure you will on the next try too
2007scape,not_removed,i camp range pray and only switch for magic then straight back to range the magic sound plays much earlier then the range sound does giving you plenty of time to tell if you should switch prayer
2007scape,not_removed,the attack styles are very different and it looked like you had plenty of time to even switch back better luck next time though
2007scape,not_removed,why not its the internet get over it pal
2007scape,not_removed,hahaa im btw hahaa usonastyrs
2007scape,not_removed,hahaa i use twitch emotes on reddit hahaa
2007scape,not_removed,if you didnt hit trust this pc for days of course it would ask for the code again
2007scape,not_removed,his problem is that it didnt ask for the code and should have done
2007scape,not_removed,oh my bad
2007scape,not_removed,i think the poll for a new jad new cape didnt pass but i do think they said about something for a second jad after you defeat the first jad but the reward wont be a new cape im not sure about this please dont hate on this comment
2007scape,not_removed,it is being polled sometime this year as part of the next zeah expansion
2007scape,not_removed,god forbid they make something challenging that rewards a bis in a slot that has an old bis for years that your pleb ass wouldnt be able to complete
2007scape,not_removed,it failed the poll and they decided to push it back torepoll in early iirc
2007scape,not_removed,then well probably get a poll soonish i suppose i dont think itll pass this time around tho atleast i would vote no to it depending on what the reward is
2007scape,not_removed,you werent banned for botting the account however was and judging by your post it was deserved i dont see the problem generated unique char passes should be common practice
2007scape,not_removed,i think its not deserved because the only time my account ever botted was once through another ip while the password was changed this shouldnt compromise a players account permanently if they are legit
2007scape,not_removed,so why wouldnt people just logoff for a week come back on a vpn bot a skill they dont like stop when theyre done gp or level wise wait a few weeks log back in from real ip and see if banned and if they are claim they were hacked your accounts security is your responsibility
2007scape,not_removed,your negligence to your account security cost you your account nice
2007scape,not_removed,so your telling me i botted a couple of red chins after training hunter legitimately and never having any suspicious activity before my account was hacked its just not fair that this is overlooked
2007scape,not_removed,thanks man i even used my jagex authenticator to be safe but it happened anyway thanks again fam
2007scape,not_removed,should have kept your email secure
2007scape,not_removed,getting hacked sucks i would make a runescape only email
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,shut up
2007scape,not_removed,lol welfare at its finest
2007scape,not_removed,this saturday marks week at which point accounts that havent logged in this season will log in with hour pvp immunity normal xp rates and all quests completed so you can absolutely join late also the immunity is game time too so you can get some serious grind in if you plan it out
2007scape,not_removed,hour immunity and dmm xp rates is op you could easily start on saturday
2007scape,not_removed,mmh any tips advice on what i should take advantage of with that immunity
2007scape,not_removed,what timetimezone does the hour timer start on saturday
2007scape,not_removed,what timetimezone does the hour timer start on saturday
2007scape,not_removed,the only skill that i think you can log in on a fresh account and train is hunter and you can get that into the with your immunity thatll make you some nice cash if you just catch grayredblack chins when you get the appropriate level besides that i think youre only other option is to pick a cb skill and train it as much as you can
2007scape,not_removed,i think its just hours of gametime when you log in after the
2007scape,not_removed,appreciate the advice i was thinking of trying to power through range and get the hp up as high as i could so i dont get hit once that immunity wears off im not big on hunter so id love to hear any other ideas thank you
2007scape,not_removed,i know but i was wondering exactly when that hour protection begins so that i dont log in beforehand turns out its utc march
2007scape,not_removed,hunter is sort of the only thing that you can make money without money training range youll be wasting time earning money to get your ammo and gear melee is the only cb youd be able to train high for free any other option would need to be funded by an alt account before you start it im sure you could do some kind of gathering safely like wine of zamorak if you do stronghold for coins to fire strike mage wont get you great xp but youll get cash pretty quick the best thing to do with immunity is to set yourself up to make money because you can train everything in a safe zone or super safely after you train cb a bit in safe zones
2007scape,not_removed,training melee would be one of the best viable methods for the hours literally go and get some basic melee stats and get starting slayer its super difficult for most people because all the tasks are in dangerous areas however with immunity you can just take full advantage high slayer provides good money the drops from tasks etc
2007scape,not_removed,edit read you comment wrong thanks for the exact time
2007scape,not_removed,i hopefully wont have to worry if about if i can get a small loan of a million gold pieces from a would you still say i should go with hunter
2007scape,not_removed,if you get from a friend see if hed be your biggest pal and trade you a helm of nezzy mith scim rune scim d scim str ammy full mith cammy tab maybe food a bunch of str pots and the rest cash spawn in lumby and go to rfd chest and buy barrows gloves cammy tab to rock crabs and train there with immunity you can bank at fremmy isles to get more str pots but with immunity and max bonus gear like that you will get atk str def no problem
2007scape,not_removed,at first i thought you were talking about cooking
2007scape,not_removed,congratulations
2007scape,not_removed,congratulations

2007scape,not_removed,untrimmed hp cape is one of the easiest untrimmed to get on a main lol
2007scape,not_removed,pleb confirmed
2007scape,not_removed,hp cape is pretty legit
2007scape,not_removed,untrimmed hp cape is pretty pogchamp
2007scape,not_removed,i could have had that cape too c but i got cooking a long while ago for afking something lol but yeh thats something everyone would want or untrimmed slayer congrats man
2007scape,not_removed,i had to stop myself from getting hp cape so i could get mining cape untrimmed none of my combat stats were even close to getting to i currently have invisible hp and still have yet to get another combat stat to
2007scape,not_removed,it is really easy but takes some time
2007scape,not_removed,but yeah youre right lol i didnt do it on purpose
2007scape,not_removed,just hit range might sit there for awhile lol
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,go to world drop cape and get then tele grab
2007scape,not_removed,you dont have to anymore
2007scape,not_removed,i watched a video of a guy testing multiple ways to do it and thats the safest way it worked for me and im planning to do it everytime
2007scape,not_removed,no i mean you dont have to do that at all your untrimmed cape stays untrimmed now i just tested it yesterday i had my untrimmed agility capei got cooking and when i bought my cooking cape my agility cape stayed untrimmed i had to go buy a new agility cape to get a trimmed version now i have both without even trying
2007scape,not_removed,yeah idk what happened to you but that shouldnt have happened i wouldnt risk it nor do i want to try it and find out
2007scape,not_removed,you got lucky man my cooking cape went trimmed the moment i got my next

2007scape,not_removed,joel get on skype
2007scape,not_removed,biblethump
2007scape,not_removed,maybe his sub ran out and he wanted to play a different a game and because of your friendship he figured it wouldnt matter to be gone for a few months one can dream
2007scape,not_removed,given his sudden absence from reddit and the game at the same time its pretty easy to figure out was his final slayer task was

2007scape,not_removed,grim was the homie feelsbadman
2007scape,not_removed,actually one of my friends told me the same thing after i mentioned his name in the cc im in he was always more of a pvmer than a pker though so it feels weird that he would switch to a pserver especially being so close to finishing his goal of slay with his name being so specific its worth a shot can you please pm me the name of the server thanks
2007scape,not_removed,dear grim i wrote but you still aint callin i left my ign my reddit name and my phone at the bottom i sent two pms back in autumn you must nota got em there probably was a problem at the reddit inbox or somethin sometimes i scribble nicknames too sloppy when i jot em but anyways fuck it whats been up man hows your slayer im training slayer too im bout to be a master if i have the money guess what ima purchase ima buy the slayer cape i read about your crocodile task and im sorry i had a friend kill himself over doing some task he didnt want to i hope you did not forget me as im your biggest friend i even got the bossing shit that you did with me i got a full folder of our screenshots and lvlup pictures man i like the shit you did on bandos too that shit was fat anyways i hope you get this man hit me back just to chat truly yours your biggest friend this is sep

2007scape,not_removed,not sure he would play for many hoursday like myself and we often pvmed with each other and chatted daily i thought he may have just burnt out from slaying so much but its been like months since hes logged in and slay was one of his favourite things to do

2007scape,not_removed,yeah that definitely is weird with that said there are a lot more servers popping up that are very pvmfocused these days its certainly not pking like it used to be i hope you find your friend

2007scape,not_removed,it was clearly what everyone was thinking youre just the idiot that states the obvious assumption in a stupid way so people dont like you
2007scape,not_removed,somehow implying that your comments here arent real life yeah you really do need to grow up
2007scape,not_removed,if you think comments on reddit are real life you really need to think this through let me light a candle for you you need help lmao
2007scape,not_removed,shouldnt according to who you a comment made on the internet is barely different to a comment made face to face
2007scape,not_removed,but they do
2007scape,not_removed,what so you think that because youre on the internet youre not communicating with real people that its somehow not real life because its written words and youre behind a computer screen yeah thats a really stupid mindset
2007scape,not_removed,boaty bores me tbh
2007scape,not_removed,i like kramer in seinfeld
2007scape,not_removed,i voted for because i watch his stream whenever hes live i only watch ice sometimes i have to be in the mood for his stream
2007scape,not_removed,i think ice is to obnoxious i voted for mmorpgrs much more enjoyable imo
2007scape,not_removed,wasted vote cx
2007scape,not_removed,give your stuff away ppl losing money from twitch scam
2007scape,not_removed,k i literally spun up my pia vpn and connected to london one dc in almost hours
2007scape,not_removed,b y e
2007scape,not_removed,congrats thats awesome
2007scape,not_removed,if im doing my math right then the probability of getting two unique drops is thats insane rng
2007scape,not_removed,lol at kc thats rly bad rng
2007scape,not_removed,thanks man my rng is absolute shit everywhere besides zulrah lmao
2007scape,not_removed,kc but my drops tfangs serp vis onyx i think my rng is pretty good
2007scape,not_removed,hey it has to balance out some how xd
2007scape,not_removed,i got after about target kills at level combat tonight
2007scape,not_removed,quest wise these were a great idea for player interaction i couldnt imagine doing it now not going to lie if it takes a good deed to keep a irl friends to keep playing i do anything theres nothing like logging into a empty friends list and they will be designated meat shields when i boss d
2007scape,not_removed,lmaoooooooooo
2007scape,not_removed,i wish i had the balls to try out weird haircuts like him
2007scape,not_removed,heh
2007scape,not_removed,autismquinn
2007scape,not_removed,nice man but on a side note how did you keep your supplies separate like law runes you had to use some no did you just keep track of how many you used and subtract it im sorry if this sounds noob
2007scape,not_removed,one black mask
2007scape,not_removed,nice dude
2007scape,not_removed,sick total loot
2007scape,not_removed,daily nmz herb boxes i recently got back into osrs can you explain this to me and if it makes much profit
2007scape,not_removed,what are your combat stats
2007scape,not_removed,what was dropping platinum tokens
2007scape,not_removed,why block the blue drags though those are the best
2007scape,not_removed,what was your cerb kc
2007scape,not_removed,those ensouled head counts look really low i went from and have about as many as you have
2007scape,not_removed,only whips from also only prim rip
2007scape,not_removed,its definitely not noob because i try to do this with clues and slayer and wish i could separate stacks so you arent alone
2007scape,not_removed,i pretty much exclusively did slayer from so it wasnt too hard to keep everything separate in terms of runes i would buy them and keep them in my pouch as i used them
2007scape,not_removed,i only did one cave horrors tasks skipped the rest
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,basically with nmz points you can buy herb boxes a day with herbs in each its a free bit of money each day
2007scape,not_removed,you can buy herb boxes with nmz points there is daily limit of if i dont remember wrong
2007scape,not_removed,herb boxes contain random herbs and you can buy everyday so doing them everyday is very profitable also they are bought by nmz points
2007scape,not_removed,nmz is a minigame where you fight bosses from quests youve done theres a few set ups you use you could google nmz methods if you want you get points for killing stuff and you can use the points to buy rewards one of the rewards you can buy is herb boxes with a max of per day you dont do nmz to make a profit its just a bonus
2007scape,not_removed,max combat stats
2007scape,not_removed,im guessing he constantly converted his gp profit into platinum coins so that he could separate it from his actual stash and instead add it to the loot tab
2007scape,not_removed,bad xphr and bad gphr
2007scape,not_removed,i was doing mainly efficiency slayer and well blue dragons are anything but that for a main account p
2007scape,not_removed,only like
2007scape,not_removed,i hardly did any black dragonsaviansiestzhaar if thats what youre referring to
2007scape,not_removed,my cerb kc was like but yeah i think i had kc on abby demons
2007scape,not_removed,right i was trying to do it with wintertodt but didnt know where to start on how to do this
2007scape,not_removed,why did you not just block them if you skipped them all the way to
2007scape,not_removed,just jking fam x
2007scape,not_removed,i didnt know about them being bad exphr but you can make around an hour if youve got decent stats
2007scape,not_removed,ya im not sure if there is a good way to go about it honestly
2007scape,not_removed,other priorities probably
2007scape,not_removed,cave horrors are one of the least common assigned tasks better to block the more common skip tasks and use points to cancel the less common unwanted tasks
2007scape,not_removed,no you werent
2007scape,not_removed,he said his block list was metal and blue dragons not sure why he would omit any in the op but maybe
2007scape,not_removed,right but he only has blocked tasks is my point guess the last qp after barrows gloves arent worth it haha
2007scape,not_removed,wait did you just
2007scape,not_removed,well the amount of blocks available is based off quest points so maybe he probably didnt get quest point cape or do lumbridge elite to have a full blocks
2007scape,not_removed,i just
2007scape,not_removed,oh yeah you did
2007scape,not_removed,you should be able to keep chins on death and dont use osbuddy switcher when near combat situations
2007scape,not_removed,i know the feeling
2007scape,not_removed,xp per hour of chins thrown per hour xp per chin x xp lost feelsbadman
2007scape,not_removed,this is why you run back up to the vine and switch worlds and dont bring more than chins with you
2007scape,not_removed,not really a dumb reason you just werent careful were you were hopping and also for taking chins with you
2007scape,not_removed,thanks for running the chin economy
2007scape,not_removed,happy for you bro
2007scape,not_removed,sure i couldve been more careful but its ridiculous you dont keep chins on death
2007scape,not_removed,this shit killed me
2007scape,not_removed,you knew the mechanics you took the risk you did something stupid you pay the price
2007scape,not_removed,thats one of the reasons why chin prices stay high if you could keep them on death the prices would crash quite a bit
2007scape,not_removed,i honestly didnt know they were lost on death call me an idiot but its true
2007scape,not_removed,wtf is that zoom
2007scape,not_removed,gotta be able to see every imp
2007scape,not_removed,it took me
2007scape,not_removed,nice ruined
2007scape,not_removed,congrats mate hope more of these come your way
2007scape,not_removed,congrats
2007scape,not_removed,very nice man this comment timer sucks ass
2007scape,not_removed,thanks bro i hope some good karma comes your way as well
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,thanks
2007scape,not_removed,prepare for downvotes
2007scape,not_removed,that editing style where people cut in and out of different scenes over and over annoys me so much
2007scape,not_removed,ive been wanting to see more things like this from firemaking for a while mainly stuff like new lanterns or items to survive cold areas than something to nerf ice spells though although i have always liked the idea of something to instant thaw you but damages you but yah a while back i suggested a shadow dungeon that requires a higher tier lantern to access i also had the dungeon drain prayer over time but an even higher tier lantern would reduce the prayer drain also i really hope we see acheron someday with it requiring some firemaking items to survive the the cold it could still damage you but the firemaking its could reduce the damage from to or such
2007scape,not_removed,noncombat skills shouldnt directly effect combat imo
2007scape,not_removed,i like this especially if it is not stackable so it cannot be abused at wyverns i wouldnt mind seeing it be something that looks something like zammy god spell and defreezes and grants a tad immunity to freeze spells in pvmnpc battles while i do not pk i think these should be useless in pvp
2007scape,not_removed,yeah i would be a bit hesitant on the ice spell suggestions if it were to be a thing it would probably have to be a very small percentage i was just throwing different ideas out there that would make sense for the item your idea for the higher level lanterns and dungeon sounds pretty nice as well i just think it would be cool to have some content that creates more of a use for firemaking
2007scape,not_removed,the issue with people suggesting the ice spell nerfs is they say oh but itll only nerf it versus certain players when in reality itll just make having x firemaking level essential for pking
2007scape,not_removed,dude that sucks ripp if that was me i wouldnt be able to sleep
2007scape,not_removed,that name tho
2007scape,not_removed,training melee stats is useful tho
2007scape,not_removed,sounds like you already finished but i was going to say the spot to the east with the terrorbirds is an awesome spot to train theres also a flyfishing spot nearby so you can usually get some free food from ppl training there
2007scape,not_removed,i think theyve considered this but if not support i do think instead of a foxed clie for fixed trees the clues are random jusst like the way fishing is set up
2007scape,not_removed,right random generated clues from nests would be more optimal and makes sense support for this idea
2007scape,not_removed,ill do it
2007scape,not_removed,min ill b there
2007scape,not_removed,great im there now
2007scape,not_removed,nope common like age
2007scape,not_removed,not lucky at all sorry
2007scape,not_removed,depends what did you get from it
2007scape,not_removed,bludgeon spine
2007scape,not_removed,mazhar uploads videos every now and then if thats what youre asking hes one of rots best
2007scape,not_removed,bullerik sometimes streams but not too often
2007scape,not_removed,i suggest son or mithprod would fit right in
2007scape,not_removed,read dialog in game instead of holding space and u would know
2007scape,not_removed,just put the client installer onto a usb install the client to the usb then plug it into an pc and launch client form usb hopefully it works
2007scape,not_removed,could be hard but it can work if ur usbstick have the right partition and enough space always keep more space then the game need move the whole folder jagexcachejagexlauncherbin on your usbstick the computer in your school still needs java or higher i guess and maybe i dont know it sorry depends on the game u need access to the registry or to an administrator account in my school u cant even charge ur mobile phone on the pc lol
2007scape,not_removed,get a vpn
2007scape,not_removed,probably reformat the usb drive to fat if it is not already this should work
2007scape,not_removed,removed this would be more suited for ices subreddit dawg the body of your submission must be related to old school runescape
2007scape,not_removed,first think i thought of when i saw that scene
2007scape,not_removed,homie
2007scape,not_removed,yup seen it recently and thought the same thing lmao
2007scape,not_removed,bro
2007scape,not_removed,barb
2007scape,not_removed,im sure we all thought the same thing when watching props to you for reaping the karma from it though
2007scape,not_removed,oh so now you enforce that rule huh i bet several threads which have nothing to do with runescape but have something to do with a streamer stay up
2007scape,not_removed,i too thought of that think
2007scape,not_removed,im surprised it took so long for someone to post this meme
2007scape,not_removed,what bro thing homie
2007scape,not_removed,if you find any of them tag me in it and ill deal with it
2007scape,not_removed,i had to stop myself doing the arm thing in front of my girlfriejd
2007scape,not_removed,its been posted at least a dozen times
2007scape,not_removed,learn to brid properly
2007scape,not_removed,studies show that pkers who git gud are able to kill people in the wilderness regardless
2007scape,not_removed,is it too hard on your little chimp brain to switch into another style
2007scape,not_removed,learn to take attack styles and switch between them countering their prayers you useless fuck lol
2007scape,not_removed,is this an obscure meme im missing the reference to or are you just bad
2007scape,not_removed,everyone here is a fucking retard whos telling me to hybrid but its easier for the enemy person just to change player u low iq fucks
2007scape,not_removed,wow its so hard for the enemy player just to one flick prayer change u fucking monkey xd
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,get finish quests or do achievement diaries set some goals for yourself then just do it
2007scape,not_removed,grind quests and grind a skill you really want to master makes it enjoyable plus getting your skills up for the quests makes it feel like nothing
2007scape,not_removed,train agility to for full graceful and access to gwd get barrows gloves and do nmz until combats and then finish monkey madness and all on youtube for quest guides work your way towards diary cape to fund buyable skills like construction i recommend hunting chins especially if low combat otherwise double astral runes at is a relaxing
2007scape,not_removed,on youtube for quest guides people actually use video guides its easier to have written guides like on the wiki
2007scape,not_removed,should i just do rooftop agility for agility or is there another way
2007scape,not_removed,try one of his guides in my opinion theyre better than the wiki because you dont have to stop to read every step theyre efficient and to the point
2007scape,not_removed,yes you can only get marks of grace through rooftop agility so do the best course you can but i recommend doing the wilderness course from because the falador course is really slow xp full graceful has a set effect that recovers your run energy quicker when standing still its very helpful when doing quests and stuff
2007scape,not_removed,recovers your run energy quicker when standing still while wearing the full graceful outfit a players run energy will restore quicker you dont need to stand still
2007scape,not_removed,ah did not know that thanks
2007scape,not_removed,id cum inside her
2007scape,not_removed,throwback to gbc days boys
2007scape,not_removed,talking about shantae i gotta play hgh and maybe start speedrunning it i absolutely loved pirates curse
2007scape,not_removed,shantae pass otherwise youve just changed the picture and the meme is weakened
2007scape,not_removed,warning its really dry beyond the pass
2007scape,not_removed,straight and to the point
2007scape,not_removed,haha me too
2007scape,not_removed,i really wana play the new game too
2007scape,not_removed,whoosh
2007scape,not_removed,are you trying to imply youve created an intentionally weak meme is that the joke because what im saying is that spelling it with the characters name would have made it better i didnt miss the point maybe youre high
2007scape,not_removed,they have a twitter account jagexsupport that from their designated time their background specifies they respond to tweets from others
2007scape,not_removed,hey all appeals for accounts should ask for a variety of info including certain payment information please make sure you are appealing through the official website mod luce o
2007scape,not_removed,ha ill have to make a twitter account cant believe they dont just have a customer support email address thanks anyway
2007scape,not_removed,i found a slip of paper with my password on it so its not necessary anymore however i find it troubling that i entered my current password as one of the last ones i remembered and was still denied access and i definitely used the official site as it required me to press forgotten password on the login page of the osrs windows client
2007scape,not_removed,nowhere dont be stupid next time
2007scape,not_removed,the report button ingame
2007scape,not_removed,you mean you were greedy
2007scape,not_removed,report the player for scamming and thats all u can do
2007scape,not_removed,i think you were indeed the first hcim to kill the bear rot wins again
2007scape,not_removed,grats how long did the kill take you
2007scape,not_removed,step one have entire rot stand by as bodyguard step two kill the bear
2007scape,not_removed,gz
2007scape,not_removed,congrats man good achievement
2007scape,not_removed,grats
2007scape,not_removed,i wouldve figured the killer would at least lure it with an alt but judging by that bow it looks like you went all out on the integrity kill
2007scape,not_removed,risking void and defender past wildy wow
2007scape,not_removed,rot
2007scape,not_removed,probably not you stupid fucking loser why is ur name rot ponies got boring so u do this
2007scape,not_removed,minutes
2007scape,not_removed,account is over if he dies regardless
2007scape,not_removed,you might as well risk everything on a hcim especially one bossing
2007scape,not_removed,rot tho lol
2007scape,not_removed,lmfaoyumaddoe
2007scape,not_removed,u wot
2007scape,not_removed,still
2007scape,not_removed,
2007scape,not_removed,u rot
2007scape,not_removed,still what hes probably never going to log in to that account again if he dies
2007scape,not_removed,what if its his first ironman
2007scape,not_removed,chances are if he grinded out callisto he just did it to get his name on the scoreboard
2007scape,not_removed,uh i would try to bring him roots or something idk man
2007scape,not_removed,it doesnt need to be his willow any farmed willow will do so wintertodt may be the answer
2007scape,not_removed,lol crimineeltje is this you im decarevs goodluck
2007scape,not_removed,wintertodt is probably the best way to get the willow seeds on ironman at low level you could also get from kingdom if you do that by putting on maples for nests or else woodcut til you get a nest
2007scape,not_removed,haha yeah bro thanks doing wt i guess d
2007scape,not_removed,autumn elegy put that exact guide up on youtube
2007scape,not_removed,thanks💙
2007scape,not_removed,most people do red chins in diary cave if you want a guide mostly on ticking but you get the best positioning as well if you wont dr zoidbergs yt guide is the way to go
2007scape,not_removed,thats cringey as fuck
2007scape,not_removed,just found this shirt that i bought years ago
2007scape,not_removed,nice cover up you just bought that today
2007scape,not_removed,you have meme in your username
2007scape,not_removed,can u even buy it nowdays
2007scape,not_removed,its possible youre talking about osbuddy its a client that a large portion of the os community uses others exist too but osbuddy is the most popular
2007scape,not_removed,is it approved by jagex
2007scape,not_removed,fantastic paint skills
2007scape,not_removed,this is easily my biggest problem with i didnt totally hate the ability bar but all the graphics changes and cosmetic items make it feel like a totally different game
2007scape,not_removed,that stick figure is really getting off by looking at what that guy is wearing
2007scape,not_removed,fashionscape has gone too far with this crap
2007scape,not_removed,if girlfriends were tradeable id give you all of mine quality post
2007scape,not_removed,i play as well as osrs downvotes inc and the overrides dont bother me as much as i thought they would i could go on but ill probably be downvoted to hell for it so nobody will see this comment
2007scape,not_removed,there were rune boots in
2007scape,not_removed,lmao
2007scape,not_removed,what about all the tier armour and weapons has
2007scape,not_removed,its funny because im always the guy on the right even to this day and ive played since hahahahha
2007scape,not_removed,i dont think we had bandos in let alone claws
2007scape,not_removed,dragon legs when the torso and nezi helm were out not borrows low standarss
2007scape,not_removed,wait we have balloons in old school now
2007scape,not_removed,these cheesy cosmetics went too far the community reddit community kept requesting gay ass cosmetics like a wooden g shield and a bucket helm lmfao whats up with people these days and jagex acrually listened makes me cringe
2007scape,not_removed,♥ u
