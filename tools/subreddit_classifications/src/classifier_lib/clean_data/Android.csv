Android,removed,this is pretty hypocritical because now the top comment in here is a mod post thats just meta and off topic saying to stay on topic seems worse then just having what i presume to be a deleted comment answering what most people are curious about and why they clicked on the comments now instead of derailing things further like you seem to be doing whats the concept here just the fact that its flexible the idea is ageless and the practicality has been emerging for a few years having meghan mccarthy put a flexible screen around her wrist isnt really anything revolutionary
Android,removed,how about you let the visitors to the thread deem what is worth discussing and what isnt by using those nifty little arrows to the left how about that maybe allow people to utilize the features of the site and you guys stop being white knights over what i presume is people going wtf at her voice because it is weird and who the fuck cares if people talk about it

Android,removed,thanks for a great years mi fans — when lei jun and bin lin came to me nearly four years ago with the opportunity to help turn a young rockstar startup into a global player i embarked on what has been the greatest and most challenging adventure of my life i moved to beijing miles out of my comfort zone in silicon valley to build from scratch a startup team within a bigger startup this journey has been nothing short of spectacular in every way and i can proudly say that xiaomi global is the first baby i helped bring into the world but what ive realized is that the last few years of living in such a singular environment have taken a huge toll on my life and started affecting my health my friends what i consider to be my home and my life are back in silicon valley which is also much closer to my family seeing how much ive left behind these past few years it is clear to me that the time has come to return as i thought about this late last year i concluded that xiaomi is in a very good place on its global expansion path and if there was ever going to be a good time for me to come back home that time is now — when i can confidently say our global business is no longer just an inhouse startup we turned india from a dream into xiaomis largest international market with billion in annual revenues faster than any company in indias history we expanded into indonesia singapore malaysia and more recently other markets including russia mexico and poland we teamed up with google to launch our first official product in the us and with our successful debut at ces — where we won prestigious awards — the world now sees that xiaomi is a global player changing the tech industry through our simple promise of bringing innovation to everyone more importantly we now have a team of some of the most remarkable and enthusiastic people i have ever worked with and leaving them all behind is without doubt the most difficult part of stepping away at the same time i know ill be leaving them in very good hands xiaomi now has a strong globallyminded executive team who will continue to drive the momentum we began together i want to thank the xiaomi founders and particularly our ceo lei jun who has been a mentor and a friend it has been both humbling and uplifting to work with a man whose vision is redefining the role technology plays in all of our lives and the role the china tech industry plays in the world as a friend and shareholder of the company i am honored that he has been very supportive of my transition and has asked me to remain an advisor to xiaomi indefinitely as we continue to extend our reach around the world for me as for many people in china the spring festival brings new beginnings and i will be transitioning out of my role at xiaomi in february after chinese new year i will take some muchneeded time off before embarking on a new adventure back in silicon valley to my xiaomi colleagues in china and india as i leave our home in beijing and bangalore please be assured that i will remain your loyal and grateful mi fan 虎哥 i will be watching diligently from the sidelines and rooting for you guys all the way and of course a very special shoutout to all our mi fans around the world who have won my heart for life stay in touch guys ill be seeing you hugo

Android,removed,orhow about you stop acting like an entitled prick and understand normal people also use phones not just geeky power users like yourself a tiny percentage of the people i know even know about android versions and even less know about new android m features you can thank google for that and im in the age demographic i can only imagine how older people feel people like you are the reason why so many people think android is much more complex than ios and why they end up buying dumber iphones that just work

Android,removed,hi i found a similar question asked on quora phrased as is there any way you can know of someone has looked into your chat window or profile on whatsapp so the top answer there might help you there is a way to know if someone looked at your profilepicture on whatsapp but not in the sense you thinkif you ever see that you are receiving a call but the person hangs up immediately or you happen to notice that you missed a call that didnt ring then most likely that person attempted to see your profilepicture but misclicked the first time this is due to the call button being right next to it im just a bot trying to share the love sorry if questions are loose matches right now im working on it

Android,removed,its new ram updates video every month ram updates still memory and ram management sucks on new oneplus the iphone will perform better at single core because iphone uses two cores and ios apps are optimized for single core usage its the opposite for android their apps games are optimized for multicore usage thats why the multicore score is always higher for android flagships lmao﻿ youre talking about two completely different operating systems
Android,removed,its because ios users are idiots with money to burn and no time they buy new things because theyre geeks but i bet the whole rest of the world makes more money than one country

Android,removed,the nexus users who hated on the pixels because they werent exactly what they a very specific subset of user wanted are ridiculous the nexus users like myself who complained after google announced this dev preview would land before for current devices had very legitimate complaints about googles insinuation that there would be a months long delay before we would see the update if google has said in the coming weeks instead of before half of the whining in the sub would never have happened so yeah ill take half the blame and admit my assumptions were wrong but they were based on some really weird pr decisions from google on oct nexus devices were getting a preview by the end of the year on oct nexus was getting the update this month that was an entire week of whining that could have been avoided if google wasnt so weird with the preview announcement

Android,removed,hello betatesters and other curious android users ive created an app for profile matched facetoface group meetings its available for beta testing at google play httpsplaygooglecomappstestingcomfaceopfaceop the philosophy of this app is significantly different from other offline meeting apps the idea is to semiautomatically match profiles for meetings instead of joining groups or answering any questions more info and documentation available here wwwfaceopcom this beta is purportedly very limited and stripped down of features due to the lack of real users im also taking hints how to properly test this kind of application that would require at least thousands of users to function properly best regards daniel agape kolsi

Android,removed,is still nougat tho is being promoted as the first nougat phone
Android,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

Android,removed,old tech with no future growth is a meaningless buzzword youre officially straight up handicapped mentally you cant speak for everyone not wanting a thinner phone im fine with them being thinner and also for the jack to take up less space that can be used for more things like forward facing speakers lessened bezels better screen tech superior haptic engines and larger batteries dac conversation eats up significant battery which is why the superior dac inside of the new airpods is going to increase wireless playtime of the iphone unit from to hours i know it wont be that many hours because you have to recharge the fucking airpods but its still a significant increase and dismissing it is ignorant problem has been solved no waterproofing that jack is still difficult and the parts are hard to come by and the design has to keep in mind that you have to waterproof of female slot which isnt at all easy to do if you at all value your quality youre speaking from ignorance not a problem guess what doesnt have contact points wireless a crap headphone what none of these at all talk about fixing it they talk about making it less noticeable you can dampen the sound but you cant remove the cable noise dipshit

Android,removed,fuck samsung never buying their products again for potentially endangering my and my familys life if they really wanted their recall to be taken seriously they should have explicitely stated that the note will blow up its a guaranteed danger to your life and return it fucking immediately now actually they should have forced a popup that exactly give that message theres no playing around with someones life or property dont say it may be faulty say it will fucking blow up sure it would hurt their popularity and shit but fuck it peoples lives are more important but no samshit decides to dilly dally and phrase it like its not as serious as it actually is so fuck them

Android,removed,seriously nova launcher has shown themselves to be the only android launcher that takes itself seriously they consistently produce new useful substantiated features i dont see many other android launchers or even other apps do as fantastic of a job as you guys do basically what im trying to say is thank you so much for putting out actual features thank you for not trying to get ratings from hot titles and latest rumors thank you for trying to get ratings from writing solid code and putting thought into almost every new feature seriously i love you guys i hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many posts about your app hit the front page but even still i wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful i am and we all are stick around and keep up the fantastic work we dont take it for granted even if it might seem like it sometimes tldr i love you nova launcher thank you for everything

Android,removed,youre fanboying pretty hard there is seriously only pro to a headphone jack when it comes to consumer usage its convenience you already have a headset that likely uses it for the manufacturer there are a ton of positives you dont have to waterproof what doesnt exist waterproofing it is a pain in the ass and the seals can degrade over time because rubber doesnt last forever it will eventually not be waterproof sorry thats just the truth the iphone also shows increased resistance to drops with the removal of the headphone jack why because instead of having a weak point where there is a large hole in the device that hole is filled by material which helps to absorb shock across the device when there is no hole the glass takes the brunt of the impact thus shattering headphone jacks is where the majority of damage happens because its a weak spot in the device due to how much of the phones core material they displace especially in aluminum unibody phones
Android,removed,please source this claim because for the love of god i cant make sense of it find drop comparisons like i did im not going to do the work for you ive told you that structural integrity is improved by removing the jack large holes in the unibody create less space to spread the force of impact this is a very simple concept to understand if the phone lands on that spot its going to push the force of the impact to the glass

Android,removed,i mean you dont have to get your panties in a bunch and be a pretentious douche if it is something implemented with the intention to only allow the owner of said eyes and fingers to unlock the device and deny anyone who doesnt have those to access it how is that not security it is securing it to your biometric data who cares if it can be mimicked a password can be hacked or even guessed that means it isnt a security feature it has flaws and can be compromised but bottom line it is intended to keep others that arent you out you can turn on your home security system to keep people from breaking in but if they are able to disable it it is no longer a security system i just dont see how your argument of being able to manipulate or trick it changes the purpose of the feature that is the whole point it is designed to keep someone out

Android,removed,again what you think it seems like means nothing whether or not they continue be to sell well is what will give us the answer people are paid to make these decisions and while it feels all fuzzy and intellectual to make these claims yourself the fact of the matter is that oneplus likely has way more data points in their decision making process than you do they have a company to run you have a reddit comment to post the stakes are a little different you can keep taking it personally i dont mind doomsday predictions from those like you are a dime a dozen on reddit and they always come out of the woodwork whenever new phones come out i dont share your opinion and i think its the opposite however i wont ever fall under the delusion that my opinion is fact when oneplus starts tanking and losing sales money and users we can revisit this until then were both just speculating

Android,removed,i agree that googles messanger situation is a mess but as a whole apple is under fire from google when it comes to software and chinese oems when it comes to hardware thats just as good if not better and for cheaper so to deliver an underwhelming wwdc in the face of this competition doesnt bode well for enthusiasm amongst those considering a shift into the apple ecosystem

Android,removed,to the casual observer i see no reason to choose a samsung device over an apple for my current i bought a moto x keep on chugging along baby because at the time it was an excellent choice for the price of i had read reviews on all the major players that were out there nothing i saw about the scamsung phones made me want one they were known for being bloated and buggy to top that off they cost the same as the iphone in contrast crapple is known for having excellent customer service they support their devices with updates for the long term they also put a focus on smooth user interaction i dont understand how samsung became such a major player
Android,removed,ill be honest ios is greatif your retarded granted we all are but when it comes down to it hun we like whats easy iphone is like that girl who really cares and keeps you out of trouble so if you appreciate good design you acknowledged who understood basic geometry but if you like punching a couple dicks and seeing who will fuck after then gamble away my son android lives fast and guzzlez your complaints like a raccoon with his ass up in a pond in the middle of july

Android,removed,thats just porting nothing to do with improvement apple has already scraped agregators like wolfram and bing but they need to improve their voice recognition as well as their ai has apple acquired and companies or employees in this area otherwise i dont see how anything could improve
Android,removed,so how come siri aint improving
Android,removed,yeah im waiting and waiting but the last keynote was about emotes so i dont know what to expect for the next ones
Android,removed,holoyolo
Android,removed,not sure i found this so i posted it
Android,removed,the very fact that apple is buying up ai companies means they know siri is behind and they are working on it google purchases companies all the time when theyre behind or not do you know what finally spurred apple to fix siri by buying tech companies
Android,removed,every company buys companies all the time i dont see the point of your statement now youre contradicting yourself before you said the very fact that apple is buying up ai companies means they know siri is behind and they are working on it
Android,removed,ok so you dont have any indicator that there will be anything new with siri at septembers keynote youre just peddling the same ramble about apple will do should do can do you could of just have said that to begin with
Android,removed,tell me how sirikit is going to address siris core problems and help it compete with google now or cortana its fluff and you know it
Android,removed,every time i prove you wrong you come up with a straw man argument no man im fucken tired of siri being shit while android gets fucken wizardry like google now you cant even switch to google now on the iphone so really im fucken tired of shitty shills like you backing up apple and coming up with excuses for not putting as much rd into its voice assistant as its competitors i understand google is going to be king of algorithms i get that but if microsoft can make a half baked voice assistant that beats siri than what in the name of god is apple doing with all that bank so stop explaining and coming up with excuses for apple falling short with siri youre the one thats trolling
Android,removed,you refuse to acknowledge anything that apple is doing to improve siri after seeing plenty of proof i acknowledge theyre improving siri just not the main problems that matter the api you keep referencing does not adress siris core voice recognition problems sentence context recognition look its your ecosystem if youre fine with the state of siri then thats cool too some of us just wanted her to improve in a meaningful way that at least matches what other assistants can do
Android,removed,youre the troll and heres why its you that refuses to acknowledge siris problems heres a recent sirihate thread in rapple a upvoted thread about siri problems top threads were all complaints about voice recognition jagged user interaction getting cut off mid sentence and no flexibility with response keywords no one mentionted party app support was what they would like to see fixed or supported oh and of course in that entire thread you were the few in support of siri not even so much as acknowledging any problems instead giving your anecdotal advice about having no issues
Android,removed,god youre dumb first im a developer have created several more complicated apps contributed to some low level linux projects and worked on reverse engineering drm systems in my free time second we have to start from the beginning lets start in the late in germany germany wants to introduce payment via card safe and fast the issue what if the device that reads the card steals the data and pin the solution the card itself never ever exposes any data to the outside — instead the card has a secure chip that gets a pin an account number and an amount and it generates a cryptographic signature which the merchant stores at the end of the day the merchant transmits the signatures to the bank they check if they are valid and then transfer the money what you might notice even if the merchant would get the card number and pin and cve he still couldnt get more money — as he doesnt have the chip this emv principle is safe and secure and ensures it can be done no matter how insecure the device is now the thing is android pay could use the same concept every sim card has a chip specifically made for such payments and it would be safe even if the device was rooted custom rom etc — unless one physically breaks the sim open google wallet used to use that and thats how it worked even with root legally yet there is one small issue you either need a phone with gsm or if its cdma with a special additional chip which is expensive thats why google wallet worked on such few devices in the us but you might guess by now why dies android pay not use this secure module when it us available and allow even root then no one knows instead of keeping the data required to make as many payments as you want on a physical chip you control android pay stores it on googles servers and android pay just talks to them crazily stupid extremely risky insecure and obviously the reason why they dont want root but by now you might know that just using the emv chip that — in contrast to when google wallet was popular — is in every device with gsm or would solve all the issues be more secure and have better privacy and thats my proposal for the solution

Android,removed,shield color is a arcade game and playable for all ages even if your kid under or bigger shield color designed and made to be simple and easy to play and understand the game and the levels and we made sure to make and keep the game fun and challenges so we have design the game with multiple game modes such as mode for the levels game area mode for score challenges colored game mode and shapes game mode etch one of these game modes is different than the other so in the center of the game area there are a big circle witch this is the circle that the player must defense it with the shield color and must choose the correct color to change the shield color and protect the big circle because if you choose the wrong color or miss any behind then the game over will show and will loss the round backing to the first game mode levels so in levels mode will start with easy game a play and need to destroy the coming shapes witch in the first level only shapes will come and must destroy theme by clicking and choosing the same shape color to change the shield color and make the shape destroyed and when moving to the next level level will not come only shapes it will increased etch time level up by one and so for the next level etch time will increase the coming shapes by one more but the game cant be challenges if only one more shape will come and to destroy it so the game programed that when the player destroy an shape the next shape speed will increase letter bit and so the game get harder litter more etch time and then the started shape speed will not be same as the last shape speed so by that will keeping the game not at the same all the time but to keep it challenges and get harder etch time as also the shape that are coming will be the same all the game but every five levels up will unlock different shapes and the player can unlock about up to shapes within levels not just the shape will changed also every levels the colors will changed and will get new four colors for etch five levels up for the level for regards to the second game mode score challenge no levels will be shown and will not start with an easy game play but will start with the normal speed and etch shapes has destroyed the next shape speed will increase but this game mode is harden than the levels and this part will challenge your friends with your max effort that will gave the third mode of the game will not see any levels or four different colors to choose but will have to save the big circle with anther method not touching the color but hit and drag with the finger to get line and make this line cut the coming shapes that dont have the big circle color because if you tried to destroy shape that have same big circle color you will lose some point and will reduce your high score so keep awake and destroy only the needed finally the shapes game mode you will check yourself how can you be fast to match the coming shapes by rotation the big circle with your fingers and let the correct shape hit the big circle so you need to keep two things in mind to win the round keep awake and dont miss any behind be faster as you can to jump and ne the super shield color

Android,removed,yea but who uses their phones as well thats an outlier apple assholes are the norm
Android,removed,here is my though even if you think android is better than ios for various different reasons it cant be worth having to use sms to communicate with other people imessage is clearly much superior because we always have threads like this im not american everyone here uses whatsapp but if i was american i would have an iphone just because i think communication is more important than whatever android can offer
Android,removed,the ux works so why not dont tell the nexus warriors though
Android,removed,many iphone users would switch to android if they could keep imessage and that right there is why well probably never see it imessage is their big way of keeping their pseudomonopoly
Android,removed,all google has to do is make a decent communications app not different ones man i just dont understand why its that hard hangouts needs more attention than what it has gotten by them its sad really
Android,removed,apple users shouldnt be able to reliably chat with people who dont buy from apple
Android,removed,im android user actually you misinterpreted what i said
Android,removed,yes because io was full of announcements oh wait no it wasnt they spent the majority of time talking about two messaging apps that will probably be forgotten about in a year
Android,removed,why do people seem to like whatsapp over telegram just due to already installed base
Android,removed,which clearly shows you have never used an android device as a daily driver not when youre insulting the persons credibilty
Android,removed,well they clearly say they are using android and you basically say their lying youre free to disagree with it but down playing someones credibility isnt necessary

Android,removed,yes you are in the minority about both of those just from my experience working in social media and web development there were studies done on both as well im on mobile and cant link to them at the moment you bring up amazon but amazon is also one of the worst for reviews they are filled with fake reviews and shills being paid to leave them sometimes these shills are paid to leave negative ones on the competition in addition i was only speaking to business reviews and not to a product reviews product reviews are a completely different thing than a business review my previous comments have been directly towards yelpgoogle reviews that affect the livelihood of small and medium sized businesses owners not one to get into a reddit debate since it leads nowhere good day to you sir keep on doing you and ill keep on doing me

Android,removed,reading the accusations of anandtech since the review came out has been extremely revealing of the fanboys on randroid it was especially funny to see having a meltdown yesterday ive always wondered why his comments in rapple always have the same slant and his comments here yesterday has shown me that hes just a fanboy if anything came from this its that ive been able to tag a bunch of fanboys in res
Android,removed,seriously anandtech has shown themselves to be the only tech news blog that takes itself seriously they consistently produce new useful substantiated content i dont see many other tech journalists or even other journalists in other fields do as fantastic of a job as you guys do the pipeline stories fantastic sources of information dont see others doing this you dont just post oh boy i think this is phone is the best lol apple rulez android drulez or viceversa you go through the statistics datum by datum to see what it could mean thats dedication every week the featured reviews awesome what a great way to find new gadgets original reviews insightful and honest opinions i love it all other general news always original content rarely do i see recycled this rumor happened and this is coming out like i do from literally every other blog analyzation pieces perfect probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever basically what im trying to say is thank you so much for putting out actual content thank you for not trying to get pageviews from hot titles and latest rumors thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post seriously i love you guys i hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page but even still i wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful i am and we all are stick around and keep up the fantastic work we dont take it for granted even if it might seem like it sometimes tldr i love you anadtech thank you for everything

Android,removed,dont worry the samshills in this subreddit will assure you that a device somehow is exempt from basic quality control measures that we should be thanking samsung for having the decency to admit that they just duped hundreds of thousands of people into purchasing a hand grenade
Android,removed,the samsung pr shills are out in full force the last few days like an unprecedented amount of people popping up with comments like samsung™ can do no wrong ps heres a list of all the features i like on my new samsung™ galaxy™ note™ articles about this issue getting deleted by mods just sad

Android,removed,when you spread your self too thin you will fail when you force people to join you on spreading too thin then you not only will fail but make many people angry when you force people to join you by malicious acts then the angry people will tear you apart
Android,removed,also what kind of maintenance is shutting down your phone youre missing the point im making an analogy installing new drivers or software often requires a reboot on desktop operating systems this takes a few minutes to do rebooting your phone is akin to maintenance on a desktop os in regards to time spent and inconvenience to the user theres no need to stop workinggamingwhatever sure but you still have to shut down eventually to accomplish this why should your phone be any different
Android,removed,well thats a poor analogy its not a poor analogy because youre too short sighted to understand it yeah thats probably the case on xp and nope windows most of people shut down their pcs at night and again you didnt refute my point jesus youre fucking dense the pc still has to be shut down time of day is irrelevant in this analogy
Android,removed,hahahahaha first you said horrible logic then you went on to draw a shit parallel when you dont even know what a real maintenance is on a pc fucking troll you got me you joker i almost took you seriously for a couple of minutes

Android,not_removed,am i shadowbanned
Android,not_removed,id be very surprised if they didnt run out of at least color
Android,not_removed,if youre willing to settle for a silver non black is definitely gonna run into supply issues
Android,not_removed,to be fair the did not have supply issues either it simply sat unsold in warehouses until they had to resort to pricing them aggressively the anniversary edition iphone should be quite the adversary not implying that this is some sort of disaster but i expect the prices to drop as usual
Android,not_removed,walked into best buy today there was a handwritten sign that said preorder your before its too late tacky af and kinda sleazy
Android,not_removed,ill believe it when i see it
Android,not_removed,in the us is there any way to get the coral blue variant
Android,not_removed,i was already placed on back order via my carrier for a black but i have hope it will resolve itself i doubt it is sold out after less than hours after preorders went live
Android,not_removed,doubtful on tmobile most people wont pay down
Android,not_removed,why are you so certain
Android,not_removed,i would have thought the blue would sell out first its the color most reviewers seem to favor the most
Android,not_removed,i played with one yesterday imo it looked amazing but the aluminium frame felt plastic because of whatever coating they put on it silver one on the other hand felt much better
Android,not_removed,the silver looks better this time around the black is getting boring
Android,not_removed,im guessing that will happen to this one as well not a whole lot of buzz going on
Android,not_removed,its best buy
Android,not_removed,wait for third party to sell it on amazon or bh
Android,not_removed,what carrier
Android,not_removed,surprising people wont put downi mean its the same final price anyway but if someone cant put down its really a bad idea to be buying a phone in the first place
Android,not_removed,holy shit that much thank you for deciding which phone im preordering
Android,not_removed,because the same thing happened with the and the note was backordered with regular still available and including the note black was always first to go
Android,not_removed,what you played with one what yesterday you said generally that the frame felt plastic but specifically not on the silver one so are you saying the frame on the black feels like plastic are you talking about the gray
Android,not_removed,what
Android,not_removed,pretty phones will always sell well the modem and gpu has had a decent sized upgrade display is a newer generation and the camera too gsmarena did say that the sd card slot also took ufs cards though that might just be pure speculation everything is still pointing towards samsung pricing the phone aggressively to undercut the iphones when they release this is indeed one of those incremental upgrades samsung might be saving up for the note perhaps
Android,not_removed,tmobile
Android,not_removed,marketing is very good at convincing people that they need this new shiny thing to fill that hole in their life thats consumerism for you
Android,not_removed,its shit because down means money lost if you trade in the phone prior to months same end cost anything before months down payment wasted and tmobile knows this its their way of cost reduction from jump on demand im sure
Android,not_removed,yeah but hes saying that the plus will run into issues i know that me and you both got the base p
Android,not_removed,im talking about the black one sorry i only saw the regular in gray was only available in black
Android,not_removed,which part dont you get
Android,not_removed,my experience is either the mobile department is overwhelmed and cant talk to anyone or very pushy like used car salesmen they are very poorly stocked and the reps arent well trained on phones but i really dont go there much and they are in traffic hell wanted to go there this weekend to look at but they are closing lanes for construction this weekend
Android,not_removed,i was able to preorder mine this morning on tmobile
Android,not_removed,theyve never been back ordered not sure who told you that the ship date has never changed and is still launch httpsexploretmobilecomshippingdates
Android,not_removed,not everyone is on jump
Android,not_removed,there only difference between the and is the name bigger screen bigger battery and bigger size bigger isnt necessarily better so theres no real reason to buy the
Android,not_removed,are you saying black felt plasticy and silver did not
Android,not_removed,that is why my representative told me over the phone when i ordered i can try and check online later if i can see any form of shipping or order status she said the same thing with both of my orders i ordered two in black
Android,not_removed,battery life is better on the
Android,not_removed,yes these were just quick first impressions though
Android,not_removed,just as likely the rep has no idea what heshe is looking at
Android,not_removed,because the screen is bigger since it eats up more power
Android,not_removed,wouldnt be the first time i just checked the estimated date and it looks good on both phones
Android,not_removed,look at the stats that have been released its similar life to the edge
Android,not_removed,controls icons arent showing on notifications nor on lock screen anyone also has this issue
Android,not_removed,does anyone else find it funny that the author posts a picture of some phones security patch level to show that the phone is up to date but only shows that the phone that they took that picture on is out of date be careful what videos you watch dude
Android,not_removed,image by dallas thomasgadget hacks looks like the author provided the image at least who knows the story of course
Android,not_removed,the image im referring to is the one down the page with that exact caption the one with the security patch level info
Android,not_removed,no not at all in fact i believe the exact opposite i think the author is not as educated on this subject as they profess to be also dont delete your messages thats weak and cowardly
Android,not_removed,insofar as clickbait
Android,not_removed,precisely
Android,not_removed,why i guess maybe samsung has a certain sterotype when it comes to updates all android device makers have this problem samsung is zeroed out because theyre the most popular device maker as the most popular brand of android devices theyre the standard bearer of the android experience and in that role theyve done a pretty good job except in updates the updates wont be good enough until samsung can get the security patches to devices inside of a few days allowing their customers to use vulnerable devices is simply unethical customers like our dear author here it seems your parents didnt teach you manners did they anyways i only deleted them because i got confused about the image you were talking about i could either strike out the comment since its invalid or delete it its the same thing my arent we salty no its more rude to delete the comments the polite thing to do would be to strike out what you originally said and fessed up to the confusion in an edit that way people dont get confused you delete comments because you fear downvotes dont be worried about the silly internet points i didnt attack you theres no need to be a jerk about this
Android,not_removed,well maybe but the point of the article is that samsung might have improved a bit when it comes to updates and kudos to them but improving a bit just isnt good enough when it comes to security theyll continue to have this reputation until they eliminate the problem entirely actually you were salty first you wanna go back to your little safe space eh really pointing out irony is salty okay i guess what does all of this have to do with the lackluster security updates in nonnexus devices
Android,not_removed,yeah it really sucks you know what the real solution is though stop buying phones from manufacturers that dont provide prompt security updates thats it thats the solution if people cared more about the security of their devices and less about how thin the device is or how svelte the curve at the edge of the screen was then device makers would very quickly shift to provide their customers with what they demand but you wont or if you do then other people wont the sad fact is that security does not sell phones just remember all of this next time youre in the market for a new device maybe the fact that the nexus doesnt have the latest and greatest soc isnt a deal breaker if you think about it
Android,not_removed,i was actually saying it ironically per a data report motorola is actually the fastest in update times in the us when excluding nexus devices i think however you could also argue that it wasnt really only nexus devices that had this issue it still sucks almost isnt good enough when it comes to security this depends on how you think about it from the technological side it depends for user experience it depends again the snapdragon did have some kind of overheating issues with some devices including nexus devices there are so many aspects to the equation that the word dealbreaker becomes whatever you want it to be whenever you want it to your phone can be smooth as butter but all that goes out the window if a hacker locks your phone up for ransom but youre proving my point in a way its not an important thing for most users theyre more worried about the now effects of their purchase psychologically it makes sense humans are really bad at risk assessment
Android,not_removed,yes but if for example youre expecting sameday updates that may be a bit far fetched same day no within a week though these are serious issues that need to be addressed and device makers are treating it like an annoyance i do software development for a living i get it there are business priorities that often run counter to doing the right thing it takes discipline to do security right what these phone makers are showing is a distinct lack of discipline why would they take it seriously though their customers dont yes but its not like phones could be virusproof or ransomwareproof absolutely however we should always strive to protect devices from wellknown exploits it may depend on many factors for example on the technological side the snapdragon is miles better than the snapdragon and that includes real world experiences too to an extent and that matters why i understand that some phones had overheating issues with the but i dont see what the point is why would you buy a phone with the latest and greatest hardware if the software is crap so indeed devices should ideally get the latest security and overall software updates but the hardware powering that software is in my opinion equally important its pointless without good software your hardware might as well be a pocketwarmer you know what was the single most important factor in the improvement in battery life and performance on android in the last three years ill give you a hint not the hardware if the software doesnt deliver then the hardware doesnt matter im only arguing this extreme because thats what you seem to be arguing in reality people are going to buy what is marketed better and what scratches their shortterm itch
Android,not_removed,yes but there may be also bug testing and qa involved which may take time it takes a lot less time than you think the vendors are made aware of these updates well in advance of the disclosure of their respective exploits these fixes are almost always localized im not talking about feature upgrades here from the standpoint of the user these fixes almost never impact their user experience when they do its because the user was able to do something that could cause serious security problems well it does matter a lot after all the chip is whats powering the phone if the hardware sucks then having the latest and greatest software may not matter that much and similarly if the software sucks then having the latest and greatest hardware may not matter that much too in my experience software can work around poor performing hardware hardware isnt really able to make the same claim well it could both the hardware and the software i dont want to get too technical here why i can take it but the move from lpe to lpp has definitely had some benefits for power consumption and perhaps performance too i mean vdd core in samsungs process isnt something to be laughing at right and hardware has always been able to get better at doing some job with less time but you know whats even better than that not doing the job at all software can make choices like that hardware cannot
Android,not_removed,maybe and maybe not it depends i dont know well i do know these kinds of changes take very little in the way of qa the code changes are usually quite small and usually involve one singular feature if theyre doing it right and they have test coverage the qa process might involve checking to ensure that the build isnt broken and that their regression tests arent failing some handson time is required but this only takes a few days if there are no problems maybe but not necessarily always unless were talking about games or something yes necessarily always unless the hardware is flatout faulty its always possible to select a cheaper code path when necessary it may not be easy hence how long it took for android to actually start performing well but its always possible the hardware can never do this perhaps but that might not be the only improvement generally thats what improved hardware means doing more with less what other definitions would you offer hardware and software are both important in general well sure but in my experience software is where the most important improvements happen hardware is incremental by nature
Android,not_removed,would also be awesome if stars only showed recent update reviews for example es file explorer was pretty damn great banked a ton of positive reviews then one update it all went to shit spammy behavior bloat lockscreen ads however they rode on their high reviews from last few years result you are downloading an app riddled with shady ads and practices which happens to have stars and million of downloads looks legitimate yet acts like a common trash
Android,not_removed,finally
Android,not_removed,and we still get examples like dawn of titans or whatever that has hundreds of totally spammy reviews and the game isnt even out yet
Android,not_removed,still no fix for silent star reviews those make no sense at all and should be forbidden
Android,not_removed,excellent app it has an intuitive user interface and ads that arent too annoying would highly recommend leaves stars
Android,not_removed,and vice versaif a broken app gets a game changing update and star reviews start rolling in they should get more weight than the one star reviews for the broken version
Android,not_removed,so like steam recent reviews score and all time reviews score
Android,not_removed,would a weighted system be overly complicated
Android,not_removed,this would be great likeways for pokemon go after they implemented safetynet garnered reviews complaints
Android,not_removed,still doesnt help with the app is great does everything i want but to keep you motivated ill give you stars lol though
Android,not_removed,clan clashers
Android,not_removed,how about removing reviews that give one star for useless shit like why not snapchat working on my nexus one
Android,not_removed,doubt it app store steam use it
Android,not_removed,to be fair id wager more legitimate players were barred by safetynet than cheaters thanks to this seeminglyneverending catandmouse game cheaters can still bypass safetynet gg niantic
Android,not_removed,apple and steam dont use weighted systems they use a dual system that shows you different averages for the current version of the app and one for all versions a weighted system would show only one score but weight the average towards reviews that a review more recent versions and b other users have thumbsupped so the more recenthelpful reviews would have far more impact than the old reviews or the ones that give with no explanation
Android,not_removed,yeah but to be fair randroid also has this attitude towards anything imagine if oems had a review platform on their site lol
Android,not_removed,or like most brazilians that leave star because an app doesnt have that abortion of a language they speak over there
Android,not_removed,id upvote your comment but you used lol instead of lmao
Android,not_removed,is lol being phased out now would it be better if i used different emoji
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,rule
Android,not_removed,i have an ipad pro for ios a google pixel xl and for android and a couple phones pretty much only use the pixel and the ipad though im not really sure what youre trying to ask beyond that but there you have it
Android,not_removed,i own an iphone purely because it was provided to me by work it is nice that i have gotten the opportunity to try ios without having to buy a phone but having said that i dont feel like id want an iphone as a daily driver other than imessage im not really interested in ios
Android,not_removed,just android and windows used to have windows phone but yeah apps
Android,not_removed,i use android linux and chrome
Android,not_removed,got the whole packet macbook pixel xl iphone and a gaming desktop use them all every day
Android,not_removed,android on the streets ipad in the sheets
Android,not_removed,pixel for android ipad pro iphone plus for ios surface book for windows asus for chrome book apple watch for watch os roku chromecast apple tv google home for iot waiting for a decent android wear watch without compromise im all over the place and keep rotating between various devices
Android,not_removed,why is this so downvoted i use android as my main phone i have a lumia i use as a backup phone windows phone is good but the severe lack of appsapp updates makes it a horrible main phone i wish microsoft would announce the surface phoneor whatever its gonna be called already windows phone is dead and will never recover the only hope microsoft has left is windows arm having that on a phone would be a dream come true
Android,not_removed,at one point i switched to an iphone after only having an htc droid eris but i hated it so switched back to android then last year after my friends told me ios had changed i tried an ipad and still hated it so i returned it but as far as your whole switching phones thing t mobile has a program where you can switch phones times a year for no extra costs and its pretty cool
Android,not_removed,android on the phone debian on the laptop and soon debian also on the desktop
Android,not_removed,its been just android for me since i moved from symbian about years ago
Android,not_removed,i have a pixel xl oneplus and iphone plus currently my pixel is my daily driver but i do anywhere with the honestly i barely even pick up my iphone anymore ios just isnt for me anymore
Android,not_removed,android macos windows and kali linux
Android,not_removed,if i had the cash laying aroundi would absolutely run oss on a weeklymonthly basiswell at least until i find out that one works better than the other for me im just not sure when an ios device would work any better for me except maybe when i know i have to get shit doneios is more boring than andoridso i wouldnt be as tempted to pick up my iphone and tinker with it as i would my android device
Android,not_removed,my very first smart phone was a launch model droid the original with the slideout keyboard when verizon got the iphone i made the switch i was pretty bothered by the delays in updates android phones had and to a lesser extent still do ive owned every generation of iphone since the and currently own a plus and apple watch i dont really get tribal about my smartphone choices anymore ios has simply suited my needs i have a second phone for work and was using an iphone se until a few weeks ago my boss called and informed me he wanted everyone on android for standardization purposes he said they would order me a new phone paid for by the company i was expecting something woefully out of datecheap so i was quite surprised when ups dropped off a brand new pixel ive had it for a few weeks and im pleasantly surprised i had messed with a variety of android devices over the years and while they seemed nice none of them felt as comfortable as my iphone nothing was compelling enough to make me want to switch the pixel has gone a long way to changing my mind im not ready to divest myself of the apple ecosystem yet have an apple watch most of my friends and family use iphones and imessage but if google keeps it up with this line of phone i might eventually be persuaded in the mean time i get to enjoy the best of both worlds d
Android,not_removed,yes i have oneplus one running android and intex aquafish running sailfish os
Android,not_removed,android phone windows laptop ive got a couple linux mint bootables floating around that i use for work and play on occasion ill toy around with my wifes iphone btw ive had the for the last week so great
Android,not_removed,i use android and windows with a nexus as my daily driver and a pixel i got for cheap due to a broken sim reader as a companion device
Android,not_removed,how are you liking the pro ive heard great things
Android,not_removed,i have yet to get a windows phone but i usually switch between my iphone and my pixel a lot usually not everyday but definitely a lot
Android,not_removed,multiple devices running multiple versions of cyanogenmod soon to be lineageos
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus galaxy shield ipad air ipod touch and then a sruface pro i kind of like it just so long as theres a somewhat unified way of accessing important data mail calendar bookmarks
Android,not_removed,i pretty much used iphone for a bit and then i found it a hassle because of sync i felt like i had no control over it since i am not using a mac or something so every time i tried to play a game and put the phone to idle it would drive up my ping and it drove me mad when the community said works better on a mac seeing how my country has issues with network and data plans and i have to therefore rely on locally stored things i am only using android also there is a lumia somewhere that i purchased just to have a look and sometimes i use that too
Android,not_removed,android and manjaro linux
Android,not_removed,i have a triple boot windows elementary os and macos on my pc planning on adding android when im bored enough to windows on my surface pro android on my phone
Android,not_removed,i only use android and linux windows on pc but im really considering getting an iphone this year even tho i hate apple as a company but i really want to try the other side and if the iphone will be like the rumors tell full display on front etc then im totally down for getting an iphone but seriously i would hate losing all the benefits of android
Android,not_removed,galaxy for android ipad for ios lpatop for i like having choice and the majority of things i use are multiplatform anyway
Android,not_removed,pixel xl is my personal device iphone plus for work
Android,not_removed,i had an ipad that i no longer use im all android for mobile unless you count windows on my laptop
Android,not_removed,yeah after using ios for a while it becomes boring so i switched to my pixel because android is much more customisable and open pixel is my current daily driver
Android,not_removed,i have an android phone an ipad a windows desktop pc a macbook and a linux home server theres nothing wrong with having multiple oses it actually keeps the experience interesting especially with tablets since they will generally end up having the same apps as your phone if the os is the same of course you do save money this way that said you mentioned you want to switch between phones monthly its easy to keep mostly everything in sync nowadays the main problem i see is that itll be a pain if you want to keep your messagessms in sync between phones it is possible its just not linear and has to be done manually unless theres some new method im not aware of
Android,not_removed,i carry an ipod touch gen around via wifi tether to my google pixel i have most of my games messenger contacts music on it while the pixel had all of my utility applications vr apps and other convenient apps
Android,not_removed,i have at least two phones on me at any time one for work and one for personal use ios cant be beat for the personal use aspect because social media apps are better than any other os android though lets me be away from my pc all day and accomplishes everything that i need to do that no other os can come close to doing
Android,not_removed,macos on laptop wx on desktop ios as my daily driver and android whenever i feel like playing games there would i use ios and android at the same time no unless the latter works as a mobile hotspot ive already tried it with a phone and music player being separate devices and it didnt work out so well
Android,not_removed,i have my galaxy mbp intel atom surface and ipad usually i just use my phone or mbp the surface is mainly to watch videos on the ipad was given to me to use for a class
Android,not_removed,as someone who buys a lot of apps and games id find the two mobile os split to be obnoxious i already have a handful of games on both windows and android id hate to have to buy them again on ios but hey to each their own
Android,not_removed,im not really sure what youre asking my phone runs android my laptop runs macos my pc runs windows and my servers run linux ive tried using an iphone before and really didnt like ioss awful ui design ever since and the notifications are way too easy to miss to the point it was a deal breaker i missed androids superior swipe keyboards too i dont bother with tablets anything id want one for my laptop is much better
Android,not_removed,i have a windows in tablet to work and run ftw tv which is a aussie free to air streaming app to watch tv as i dont have a tv aerial anymore i use a ipad air for mainly run fetch tv app which is a companion app to my fetch tv set top streaming box i use a nokia running insider build so i can watch ftw tv on the go i cant run any of these apps on android as they dont work when you have root
Android,not_removed,hi
Android,not_removed,was about to open the but from what ive read their return policy is really annoying i dont want to open and give them any reason to take out a percentage of the total return i love technology and it hurts to have to be confined to one
Android,not_removed,absolutely each and every single one of you have more than one os in your phones each phone has at least oss operating at any given time in it of which androidios is only one layer your cpus have oss and your sim cards also have personal oss so to answer your question every one of us has more than one operating system
Android,not_removed,i guess im just trying to see if the community actually switches between multiple devices and even oss occasionally or do you strictly use one device part of me is trying to justify owning an android and ios device at the same time lol
Android,not_removed,yea i had the lumia for some time great camera but the app scene is seriously lacking they didnt even have instagram then not sure about how it is now but certain its still no where close to being satisfactory
Android,not_removed,good ol linux used ubuntu for some time on my secondary laptop few years ago pleseant expirence i got a pi few months ago might boot on for fun
Android,not_removed,lol you really are how often do you switch around between the pixel and iphone plua for android watch i tried a few and honestly huawei watch was probably the best all around device but defiantly wait to see what this year brings
Android,not_removed,ive seen this posted before on this sub but wont the surface phone face the exact same problems as windows phone the lack of apps
Android,not_removed,agreed and having the functionality of using your phone as an actual pc when attached to a monitor is great they just need to revamp everything else
Android,not_removed,i thought you were joking around about the intex aqua fish never heard of it and thought you were trying to be funny running sailfish os hah
Android,not_removed,nice the pixel definitely seems like a good device one of my fear was having this one plus and then seeing a great new android phone come out that i will really want this for the was my budget so dont think there is anything better for this price and specs coming out this year thanks for your comment
Android,not_removed,do you have separate lines for each i keep switching sims but imessage starts to act wonky
Android,not_removed,wow you are so smart and thoughtful
Android,not_removed,iphone se and nexus here no complaints google music works on both thats all i really care about though
Android,not_removed,i only have as many devices as i do because im a dev honestly i dont see too much point beyond that but that said if you want to switch around theres nothing wrong with that either
Android,not_removed,i switch every few weeks out of boredom
Android,not_removed,i switch between android mzp running and though i tend to use the mzp increasingly frequently my tablets and computers are all though and that wont change i do have a sitting around which i dont use anymore
Android,not_removed,its unfortunately gotten worse since the somewhat botched release which caused its market share to plummet i really liked and wish it had gone a different way
Android,not_removed,i learned system iii unix back in the day and have used a unix like language or a form of linux ever since on my personal computers ever since remember os if you do you are old like me i used to dual boot to windows as well but i found i was just losing too much control over how i wanted my machines to behave
Android,not_removed,i used to switch every few days since i used to miss the other one from which i switched but since i got the tmobile free lines promo i carry both of them most of the time thanks tmobile unlimited on lines for one for my wife and for my various devices 😂😂
Android,not_removed,i actually installed sailfish os on my opo as secondary rom and used it before purchasing aqua fish i like the concept of sailfish os and wanted to support their development wish they had a better third party oem
Android,not_removed,i just swap sims make sure to turn off imessage and facetime in settings before taking the sim out of your iphone
Android,not_removed,only in reddit you get to downvote the single correct answer in a thread a great pointer towards this pathetic mentality my comment wasnt even written in a negative tone sincerely f you guys to oblivion
Android,not_removed,i envy you developers always tell myself i need to learn a programming language this year but get a chapter in and i loose focus have c book by my tv that haunts me everyday i want to get into the tech reviewing scene in youtube since i love cinematography so was going to use this purchase as an excuse but the youtube tech scene is so saturated already and we dont need another one plus review
Android,not_removed,c is the absolute worst language to start with absolute worst way too complicated and cryptic go with something like python first it doesnt burden you with all the bullshit and lets you focus on learning the basic programming paradigms
Android,not_removed,awesome thank you guess ill burn it tomorrow
Android,not_removed,its not that bad if you have c down cold i started with c and moved on to c and picked it up quickly b
Android,not_removed,this is an interesting perspective i started with c and really appreciate the lowlevel foundation even though i never use c anymore but i guess for someone looking to casually pick it up rather than study it formally in college python might well be a better choice
Android,not_removed,piggy backing here but if you want to learn python a good place to start is with a book called automate the boring stuff its online and free very good starting point as it assumes you are not a programmer
Android,not_removed,sure but then youre not starting with c ive got nothing against c i just think its an awful language to pick as your first
Android,not_removed,c wouldnt be too bad c is what would be awful i just think something like python that lets you focus on the concept of loops and if statements and whatnot without having to worry about anything else just makes it an easier place to start
Android,not_removed,oh yeah thats true no sane human being should be starting out with c
Android,not_removed,can confirm i started with c and it was a bad idea next i learned java and it just made so much more sense still hate c its too weird
Android,not_removed,i dont understand what youre saying
Android,not_removed,the os is storing information from the last time youve used trs stereo plug and trrs headphone with mic ios has the feature as well you can also confuse the os by using normal trs stereo plugs with everything in any case its a neat little feature
Android,not_removed,on my samsung edge and note it also shows you how many times youve plugged in the headphones if you use phone info app pretty interesting useless info
Android,not_removed,had this too
Android,not_removed,google ultron knows everything about you
Android,not_removed,this hasnt happened to me in a long time does it work on aosp
Android,not_removed,android can determine that you are using your headphones or if you just plugged in the aux cable in the car and set the volume to what it was previously
Android,not_removed,they probably record it for warranty reasons that way if someones jack breaks from an unreasonable amount of insertions they can pass the buck
Android,not_removed,isnt it great its the little things that count with android
Android,not_removed,im not sure what that is
Android,not_removed,exactly
Android,not_removed,unreasonable amount of insertions ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
Android,not_removed,maybeh its not like its a dslr shutter count though
Android,not_removed,loved it always thought it was reading my mind
Android,not_removed,what phone do you have and which version of android is running on it aosp android open source project most custom roms are designed from it its pretty much the definition of stock android
Android,not_removed,omni is still a thing
Android,not_removed,nice the has an unofficial build going on recently with most stuff working i think the configpanelbutton configuration stuff is a bit borked
Android,not_removed,i guess this belongs to roneplus unless there is something special i am missing here
Android,not_removed,omni is the best thing the only custom rom that works flawlessly on my find
Android,not_removed,first sd device which is officially supported by omni
Android,not_removed,also one of the few roms that support signature spoofing out of the box which is very convenient if you want to run httpmicrogorg

Android,not_removed,owner of lg here still working cross fingers i made the mistake to buy a twn version so i cannot unlock the bootloader and install custom roms coming from a nexus i thought i was gonna die with lg interface at first but irl is not that intrusive i could disable all the lg stuff and have a clean build with google now launcher just fine nexuslike with some odd design decisions here and there specially the settingsnotifications lg was a joke and i had zero reasons to buy that thing lg is absolutely sexy though the jump from a lousely cooled to a well cooled see the heatpipe on the teardown should be massive the screendesign is absolutely perfect look at that thing it is massive and gorgeous it supports and dolby vision for fucks sake integrated google assistant from day one seriously motorola and samsung i dont want alexa or sbitch even away from my phone if the camera is half as good as the lg ill be thrilled by far the thing i love most about my phone no scrap suite no sbitch or however samsung name her no sfucking back button on the right side no sfucking distracting curved sides no sfucking cartoonish ui no but that should reflect on the price which i value more than a faster processor theres probably the power i need on the already to me the lg is a clear winner the winner the lg or even the lg never was i may very well switch to this thing months from now if it ends up being as good as it seems if only lg ditched their mild customization on the settingsnotifications it would be borderline perfect edit shit this ended up looking like an lg ad i simply like this phone i promise
Android,not_removed,i hope far east movement held out for a big cheque as soon as lg announced this phone
Android,not_removed,looks like this year will be a good round of phones from all manufacturers
Android,not_removed,damnkinda want one now im a photographer too so all that would be nice to have rocking a oneplus so its pretty solid
Android,not_removed,thats what commercials are for but never forget bootloop image retention and no updates thats what lg stands for too
Android,not_removed,i would take it over the since we all know the will be a mess of two of everything
Android,not_removed,in perfect world of whole day selfie shooting fashion bloggers it might be useful in real world however most of these functions will be used twice first time to check how it works second time to show it to someone and thats it instagram generation might find it nice probably i agree however that this ad makes ma want to like and use them sadly i know i wouldnt my honor have functions to put stickers generated from realtime data like weather and localization for example to shoot a food in warm colors to tune my face realtime slim it make eyes bigger and such and blah blah blah and there are tons of creative third party apps like those from sony that let you do a nicely looped gif or capture motion in few shots how many times we use these things lg wants to target their products to specific group of young people risky
Android,not_removed,the camera is a year old sensor btw
Android,not_removed,fellow owner here i feel you bro that said i am extremely pissed off that lg have decided to sell us europeans the model without a good dac and wireless charging what the actual fuck
Android,not_removed,rhailcorporate jk
Android,not_removed,goddamn cool your tits
Android,not_removed,what does this mean
Android,not_removed,have you seen the reviews for the camera its really not that bad and can go toe to toe with any of the flagships
Android,not_removed,how do you know its different than the and ones
Android,not_removed,bloat
Android,not_removed,this is what we miss in those minute speed tests performance over time doesnt matter who opens the game faster if it starts dropping frames in
Android,not_removed,this is the most important factor to me after this space heater i want to know what happens when i am walking outside in the sun browsing reddit currently the chokes and stutters constantly when it warms up and it warms up a ton just browsing in relay for reddit i just want consistent performance so i think upgrading to the pixel is what ill be doing
Android,not_removed,google was clever to take the at frequencies a little bit less peak performance compared to reference design but extraordinary consistency and no throttling compared to real world devices
Android,not_removed,the only time ive had mine warm up was during the initial setup very pleased
Android,not_removed,ill be honest ever since the pixel launched ive seen it get compared to the oneplus every time and the one plus either beat it or matched it in any case i know what phone im getting the oneplus
Android,not_removed,i got my pixel like a week ago and so far its been smooth as butter and overall great i do wish that allo was their default messaging app with desktop integration and wish i have better smartphone photography skills
Android,not_removed,not coincidentally the pixel phones are the flagship daydream vr devices virtual reality wouldnt work if the phones were prone to throttling so sustained performance was a major emphasis in designing the pixel phones
Android,not_removed,no wonder this post is so far down the list on the sub theres no controversy
Android,not_removed,edit shortened did you have to tldr your tldr
Android,not_removed,tldr idiots dont know about reflections
Android,not_removed,those speed tests arent a real world representation no one except my kids will open games one right after the other expecting them to still be open i play ingress on the way to work and at lunch if i open it again of the time its still open in the background
Android,not_removed,while one could make the very convincing argument that for typical smartphone usage peak performance is way more interesting than constant performance over time for games i agree which stands to question why this isnt default at least for gpu benches because lets be honest in current mid level and higher devices the difference between gpus is practically only relevant to gaming
Android,not_removed,try to flash thermal tweak extreme if you are into that stuff
Android,not_removed,my old htc one had safety feature to not overheat itself in place when you used it in full sun it would get hot to a point you couldnt stand it and you had to stop using it
Android,not_removed,a little bit less peak performance compared to reference design but extraordinary consistency and no throttling compared to real world devices i really doubt that the real world benefits are that impressive there is a reason every soc is designed for peak performance in combination with low power consumption during periods of lower performance needs as well as idling you do not load web pages for ten minutes app starts dont take that long you dont softwaretranscode videos on your phone etc for gaming on the other hand this is extremely important i honestly question why gpu benchmarks are not per default over a longer period of time
Android,not_removed,you are paying for the camera and especially for the experience
Android,not_removed,do yourself a favor and wait through november just in case the is real
Android,not_removed,id get the but i really like project fi so from a the only option to upgrade is the pixel
Android,not_removed,ive never see the oneplus beat it at anythingjust that if you dont need best at anything or service its a good value
Android,not_removed,they actually explain in the article
Android,not_removed,how does it preform while installing updates i have a moto x gen and i notice that it starts to lag a lot when google play starts updating stuff
Android,not_removed,buttery smooth
Android,not_removed,see you in two years
Android,not_removed,it doesnt help that much for extended periods only delays throttling by about a minute or so and you lose android pay and pokemon go with that shit the pixel performs well out of there box and thats a huge selling point for me
Android,not_removed,eh the specs on the iphone are not worse than a mid range android phone the soc on the iphone has been consistently the best across any phone the last two years even though iphones have less ram they have very good ram management lastly there are still some flagships at the storage on iphones is objectively faster usual gripes android users have with ios are in software and bezels to say iphones have worse specs is false
Android,not_removed,i think of the moto x at least the first for great phones that seemed very mid tier for specs
Android,not_removed,and i am paying for the display as well
Android,not_removed,i used my friends it blew me away ill wait to use the pixel but i think the is a better value for me
Android,not_removed,yes my mistake i spoke too soon
Android,not_removed,mine doesnt get hot with gps and charging my nexus would shutdown due to the heat i havent had an issue like that with the pixel
Android,not_removed,does it ever crash freeze or lag when using snapchat all my friends use snapchat and my poor nexus is having a hard time keeping up
Android,not_removed,it really shouldnt i use my old note as my gaming phone because of the large screen and it barely gets warm on that game which i play a lot
Android,not_removed,literally no performance difference in the system while installing apps crazy difference from the in the where the device would warm up and sometimes hang
Android,not_removed,you must be new here its all about the midrange pricing and flagship specs here in randroid
Android,not_removed,but what the person above didnt mention in his shortened article is that the oneplus matched and beat the xl in many areas and the one plus is a much cheaper device
Android,not_removed,hell probably say an iphone the subreddit is called android but some people out here are more ishills than the ones at rapplecirclejerk
Android,not_removed,for me once ingress goes into background and the gps location times out at mins since last call the app stops consuming cpu processes it just chills in the background and theres no activity outside of the usual notifications which would happen even if the app was not actively put in the background
Android,not_removed,yeah thats a really good advantage hehe but so far my doesnt throttle to the point it disables big cores it was before really dont know what happened but i am happy d still i want a pixel hahaha if only i had the money c
Android,not_removed,have a look at the redmi note if youre looking for a replacement to the it performs better than a does not throttle at all in fact it doesnt get hot even under load thanks to the amazing snapdragon and it costs like on amazon it doesnt support all lte bands though but you can get excellent stock roms on xda imo the pixel is great but its a first gen device they didnt do anything really revolutionary with it apart from making it top spec which even the other budget devices like oneplus do too so that ridiculous price i dont think is very good value for money
Android,not_removed,it does help if u dont use it in room temperature the phone only gets warm upto for me when playing real racing and if i had root and installed that thermal throttling mod it would not just delay it
Android,not_removed,apple socs are killing it with both cpu and gpu
Android,not_removed,the had pretty much standard flagship specs for the day the original was pretty meh though my slowed down horribly after just a year the is only just now starting to show signs of falling behind
Android,not_removed,i dunno probably in the ways you just listed
Android,not_removed,well were talking about stuff thatd be on a spec sheet so like ram core count clockspeed
Android,not_removed,and the support and carrier accesscompatibility and the option
Android,not_removed,i think valueperformance is pretty damn good on the the last time i held it though i didnt get impressed that much to be honest its a great phone but there is something to it that doesnt appeal to me would always recommend it to friends if they need a great android smartphone but are limited in their budget
Android,not_removed,no snapchat runs so well on it only android phone ive had that runs it this well
Android,not_removed,snapchat is running better then ever on my nexus from a performance perspective ive run into some issues with the app in respect to but those will get fixed in time since isnt even out yet my dad has a pixel and its a great little phone
Android,not_removed,the was at least usable my would freeze up for seconds switching apps if i had updates installing and my nexus was turn into a fps slideshow the just drops some frames here and there when looking at the total system runqueue depth things look for a lack of better description quite ridiculous we routinely have peaks where all cores of the system are fully loaded and peak at over threads it looks like google is able to massively parallelize the app update process and take advantage of even the highest corecount socs this scenario is absolutely about maximum throughput and performance while utilizing all available hardware resources
Android,not_removed,yeah didnt you know that we here on randroid only look at the price and hardware specs who cares if its the fastest android phone with great software if we cant jerk off to the specs
Android,not_removed,its not a crazy thing to expect this late into a products lifecycle smartphones havent meaningfully advanced in years theyve just got better cameras
Android,not_removed,yeah this has definitely become an iphone circlejerk
Android,not_removed,the would be the logical xiaomi choice for a substitute
Android,not_removed,cpu yes but qualcomm is still the gpu leader the might be around the but you need to factor in the time gap
Android,not_removed,support yes option not for me and carrier stuff doesnt really matter in germany worked perfectly well since the
Android,not_removed,i dont think thats the case anymore on nougat it doesnt compile the app as it did in marshmallow
Android,not_removed,dat ram doe so much room for activity
Android,not_removed,havent meaningfully advanced i can understand why it feels that way but think about the apps and experiences today and think about whether theyd be possible a few years ago games are more immersive cpu gpu display improvements apps are way more processor intensive run in the background more often constantly use data location and heavy use of the camera and output on screens with more resolution than tvs think instagram snapchat video calling foursquare etc theyre waterproof more resistant have better wireless connectivity have good voice assistance record in at fpsand battery tech has improved enough to allow of that for about hours of use weve come a long way
Android,not_removed,in terms of size yeah but everything else is weak on the mi same snapdragon is a sidegrade
Android,not_removed,yep not sure why you are so downvoted the only performs better for the first then it throttles and performs worse once you take into account the time gap and slightly worse process qualcomm are ahead of appleimagination at the moment btw note that those tests were on screen so they are comparable to pixel not pixel xl
Android,not_removed,my nexus years ago does all of those things aside from the camera stuff being waterproof and battery life good cameras waterproofing and battery life arent things invented in the last years thats what i meant when i said they havent meaningfully advanced in years also smartphone games are trash
Android,not_removed,android runs snappier on compared to the three reasons to get are stock android good camera and less than phablet size pro meets none of that cm on was great for me until i dropped it in the lake
Android,not_removed,the is effectively the same chip as the which isnt massively outclassed in gpu
Android,not_removed,lets assume you wanted better camera hardware on the nexus now all of a sudden you need a faster processor to do software optimization on the now larger photos a bigger battery to compensate for more power draw when recording a better screen to enjoy that content more storage either online or ondevice to store the files software assistance to automatically organize them a brighter flash your nexus may do some things a pixel can do today but its nearing the end of its life unless you plan on not using newer apps and technologies that come out in the future good luck powering vr devices for example
Android,not_removed,pro has a fuckton of stock android roms even nougat ones its super popular
Android,not_removed,what youre describing isnt an additional worth of hardware
Android,not_removed,yes but it is big and it has a horrible camera
Android,not_removed,ill give you that although the nexus was a steal at at the time and youre now paying for hardware rd better support marketing and exclusive maybe temporarily access to software features if you look at hardware alone the iphone isnt even worth what they charge for it
Android,not_removed,the size is just slightly above uncomfortable i wish stopped becoming the standard size that everyone keeps making but the camera is not that bad sure it wont compete against the but in good lighting it can take decent pics
Android,not_removed,yeah i wont mess with anything bigger than is ideal the camera of was unusable in low light did a much better job

Android,not_removed,there was a launch in paris so there are a bunch of preview videos up mostly in italianfrenchgerman
Android,not_removed,this hurts to look at almost suffers from that jello effect
Android,not_removed,looks pretty good on my
Android,not_removed,when are we going to get a full review
Android,not_removed,if only i had a monitor to watch this on
Android,not_removed,yup i thought it would have been better
Android,not_removed,no idea mate
Android,not_removed,you can still see some benefit from on a lower res monitor as it will have a higher bitrate
Android,not_removed,the looks like a lower res duh the poor colour blocky sky off white balance and moire is apparent in both you just see it in better detail in the resolution
Android,not_removed,really was looking forward to jumping ship from my potentially this sort of kills it for me
Android,not_removed,supersampling
Android,not_removed,already what dont you like about it
Android,not_removed,even if the video were good im not sure why youd think this would be better than the htc
Android,not_removed,and higher bitrate
Android,not_removed,nothing in particular just like that it has all the benefits of the essentially with the ufs storage front facing speakers and the rear mounted fingerprint sensor which i highly prefer im still waiting for the software standpoint though will it be customizable or will it be stuck with a locked bootloader important questions coming from someone with an extensively modified
Android,not_removed,i feel like my videos taken with it drop frames or look kind of ugly too plus the front facing camera module that was sourced from samsung doesnt focus properly at all the phone just doesnt impress me
Android,not_removed,mostly the ufs and the ffs plus the rear mounted fingerprint sensor which i prefer its a toss up but id ultimately end up keeping both
Android,not_removed,and my axe

Android,not_removed,i remember back in the day that they were constantly having issues with spam bots spamming their issue trackers
Android,not_removed,seems like someone cleaned up but this is what was there before httpimgurcomaqxvdl
Android,not_removed,yes it happens all the time i still cant fathom why anyone would want to advertise a dating service or a love consultant service on an android issue tracker but there must be a very good reason thats beyond me
Android,not_removed,i wish it was pretty much any other type of issue tracker its awful github does it better trello is better theres all sorts of solutions that arent as awful
Android,not_removed,im guessing its some malware on some guys device sending reports when i saw the one about body massages i thought of the dubbed gi joe clip where that guy goes who wants a body massage
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,likely not someones device shitty people make bots to add spam to these kinds of things all the time if you can put content in it assholes will put spam in it presumably to boost search results but thats my only guess

Android,not_removed,it only seems to do it while im in maps during navigation with it focused otherwise it doesnt read it back at all
Android,not_removed,ive done it while walkingso unless its a feature that is on constantly or i am a fast walker
Android,not_removed,dont text and drive
Android,not_removed,i wish it did this all the time when the phone screen was off when you initiated it
Android,not_removed,is it connected to your bluetooth in the car its been reading texts over bluetooth for a while now
Android,not_removed,might be a silly question but it only sends via the stock messaging app right
Android,not_removed,its done that for some time now i think it only works when google maps is giving you directions
Android,not_removed,also if it doesnt automatically read it back to you you can just say read back or similar
Android,not_removed,ive been doing this for a while in google maps
Android,not_removed,and im still over here praying that they soon change okay google to something more mouth friendly or allow the user to change it themselves that shit just does not roll off my tongue for now i say oh hey google but thats still too much
Android,not_removed,cool i wonder if they will ever fix the bug where if you set all texts to be sent via google voice in hangouts and you use voice commands the preference is ignored and they are sent by carrier
Android,not_removed,there are accelerometers in phones you know that right
Android,not_removed,i need to get a career at google someday because theyll probably treat their employees better when they enslave all of mankind in a few years
Android,not_removed,i for one welcome our new robot overlords
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i dont think you understand what texting via ok google means
Android,not_removed,im a textpert an expert at texting i concentrate better when i get textfully active this is a quote lets see who gets it
Android,not_removed,i wish it would realize that bluetooth audio has a little delay i have to turn my car stereos volume all the way down before i use voice controls otherwise it starts recording its own voice prompts and searching or texting those its the worst ux for voice control ive ever experienced
Android,not_removed,no bluetooth or maps normal conditions and driving
Android,not_removed,it doesnt work properly with signal unfortunately they refused to read the sms database despite asking to be your default sms program so while you can send messages they wont show up in your conversations it really pisses me off
Android,not_removed,nope through your default texting app i believe
Android,not_removed,is this in maps does it need an ok google first while in maps does it take you back to navigation when its done
Android,not_removed,you could get a motorola phone
Android,not_removed,i have noticed that people do not turn their head as much when holding the phone to their ear this reduces spatial awareness
Android,not_removed,i mean thats interesting but he did say texting specifically i feel like most people look at their phones when they do that
Android,not_removed,voice conversations i am okay with as long as it is hands free but if someone has their phone in their hand or is trying to type something on anything in the car that is when it is unsafe
Android,not_removed,i go for walks with my girlfriend a few times a week and it is downright scary how many drivers i observe who are looking down at their phones while in traffic even more annoying are the people who have their phone on speaker or held to their face while having a phone call and they are driving a vehicle that clearly has handsfree capabilities most people seem to be too stupidlazy to set it up
Android,not_removed,thats a security feature that im very very happy about if signal fixed this in quotes because its not meant to be fixed then google or whoever else could datamine your encrypted texts
Android,not_removed,sms on android are always handled through the central messaging database i believe all apps sending sms just write them there and the system handles sending them out
Android,not_removed,indeed i could but i dont want to i love nexus devices
Android,not_removed,the worst thing is only with google i refuse giving my data to ms or apple yet google has every permission it wants
Android,not_removed,not when they do it via ok google
Android,not_removed,my outgoing sms are not encrypted anyway thats why it is so goddammit ridiculous they keep acting like theyre making things more secure by not displaying your own messages that you sent out yourself
Android,not_removed,thats the correct answer
Android,not_removed,its called a relationship google owns that ass now
Android,not_removed,i just hate it when im driving miles an hour trying to manage the beer between my legs the cigarette in my hand the manual transmission changing the radio station and then that fucking spen always lags on me while im trying to play draw something with some stranger i fucking hate it when that happens
Android,not_removed,unless youre using signal in which case the app hides your sms from the rest of the system i get that this is a privacy app but damn is that annoying when switching between the apps
Android,not_removed,try speeding up to the extra friction on your wheels will make things easier and safer
Android,not_removed,ive never used the htc or sense in what way is it better than touchwiz
Android,not_removed,is this just the launcher or the whole framework
Android,not_removed,its actually sense home which is just the launcher not the entire sense ui probably obvious to some but op left it out of his title despite it being in the linked articles headline that said i do like this trend of more and more parts of android being swappable and manufacturers allowing users of other oems phones to use some of their software

Android,not_removed,manufacturers hate him honestly though thats pretty well known even google photos app tells you to do it once you near the storage limit
Android,not_removed,they should integrate this with google now on tap so i can be in an app hold home and more or less instantly search in it
Android,not_removed,live in beta according to
Android,not_removed,and with the upcoming lg phone youll be able to access the new in apps mode directly with a dedicated shortcut on the homescreen and second screen the lg will be the first smartphone with this dedicated shortcut in addition to searching apps you have downloaded on the new lg youll also be able to search lgs preinstalled apps a new search mode in the google app showing current and upcoming apps so whether youre using the new lg or the google app on your android phone finding your favorite tune that longlost email or your todo list is easier than ever before i wonder what kind of deal google has with lg
Android,not_removed,i have it httpiimgurcomorwaxjujpg its dark because i have a theme installed
Android,not_removed,cant wait to search my hangouts chat history using this s edit i think i have the new update
Android,not_removed,this is definitely a step towards an intelligent assistantlike feature reminds me of apple spotlight search on ios also theyre still using a nexus as their generic device really
Android,not_removed,id use a shortcut for that for sure hope they dont limit it to
Android,not_removed,available for me anyway i always get search failed please try later message it might be live but not functional yet edit judging from screenshots itt it could be a countrybased feature not yet live here italy it could be based on search in phone setting in google apps settings where you can select which elements that google could search into your phone gmail sms chrome hystory httpimgurcomschsxtj that setting is now called in apps indeed
Android,not_removed,available in beta for me screenshots and httpiimgurcomexljxfujpg
Android,not_removed,shouldnt the phones search function do this anyway why do they need another search icon for this
Android,not_removed,dedicated shortcut on the homescreen and second screen confirms it and the picture the leaked design
Android,not_removed,kind of reminds me of the olden days my first android phone the htc evo had a dedicated search button way back in
Android,not_removed,but will it work with allo or dare i say hangouts
Android,not_removed,i have it i dont see how this would ever be useful but hey whatever
Android,not_removed,its there for me already and im not even in beta its called phone for me though edit whoa i searched again just for the lulz and the in apps tab appeared
Android,not_removed,requires developer support or is more magic and just works for certain existing apis like sqlite
Android,not_removed,i have this feature but my tab is just called phone not inapp and it shows all apps on my device that support httpsfirebasegooglecomdocsappindexing not specific apps that google chose this has been a feature since app indexing has been a thing years this isnt new besides the direct homescreen shortcut and no it didnt start with firebase google migrated their old app indexing apis to firebase no ones probably noticed because who actually scrolls to that last tab for search results edit downvote me if you want especially theres other people in this thread providing proof that this is already a thing
Android,not_removed,so will there finally be a way to search hangouts now on mobile
Android,not_removed,i think the lg is the nexus in the launch even they will just rename it to nexus
Android,not_removed,for anyone wanting to get the feature right away sign up for the google app beta httpsplaygooglecomappstestingcomgoogleandroidgooglequicksearchbox
Android,not_removed,why was this never done before
Android,not_removed,didnt android have dedicated inapp search waaay back around
Android,not_removed,id be happy if it found lastpass when typing lastpass or last in the search bar so much for intelligent assistant and stuff edit i just realized it doesnt search for installed apps at all apparently
Android,not_removed,if this doesnt show up in the google search app its doa
Android,not_removed,looking forward to crapple stealing this and claiming it as their own as well
Android,not_removed,inbox doesnt work yet only gmail
Android,not_removed,i also have it but it doesnt search in facebook messenger
Android,not_removed,theres something slightly amusing about search going full circle original android devices shipped with hard keys back menu home and search search went away then menu became multitasking and they became soft keys now were seeing a small move back in the direction of the dedicated search button
Android,not_removed,can they roll out allo instead
Android,not_removed,yup google features like this always feel one step away from being seriously useful
Android,not_removed,flashback to when phones had an actual search button for this very purpose
Android,not_removed,i would actually use now and now on tap
Android,not_removed,second this
Android,not_removed,this
Android,not_removed,yup i had to opt into it though the option wasnt initially there i searched for something and clicked on phone under the search options and it asked me if i wanted to try in apps search
Android,not_removed,can confirm
Android,not_removed,given lgs lackluster performance lately and the downsizing of the mobile division i think that perhaps its more appropriate to ask what kind of deal lg made with google
Android,not_removed,probably something big to stop having them do nexus devices
Android,not_removed,does this require android nougat i would be mildly infuriated if it did edit it doesnt google beta thank you google 😎
Android,not_removed,you prompted me to go check and sure enough
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i might switch back to twitter then flamingo ily but the official app will be always better integrated not your fault but eh
Android,not_removed,that phone will not die
Android,not_removed,its not like theyve made a better looking phone since
Android,not_removed,sucks that they dont give it n considering its use
Android,not_removed,long live the king
Android,not_removed,assistant
Android,not_removed,i can already use it so its not a exclusive
Android,not_removed,wth are those notifications on the left
Android,not_removed,kohomada machan
Android,not_removed,stock android hasnt had a phone search function in a long time if it ever did it still doesnt but most android phones have the google search app so
Android,not_removed,phone search is patented by apple android had to take out truly useful search features coz of them and do it in a roundabout manner
Android,not_removed,we use apps to call friends send messages or listen to music but sometimes its hard to find exactly what youre looking for today were introducing a new way for you to search for information in your apps on your android phone except it doesnt work with all your apps so its pretty unreliable i really dont see the point in this feature
Android,not_removed,one mans junk is another mans treasure
Android,not_removed,i feel like it would be more useful if it was more visible
Android,not_removed,its app indexing
Android,not_removed,i posted about it in another thread this replaces the phone section and adds more search result say if i search for a name of a musician friend it shows me his contact card link to his youtube video and soundcloud as well if i search for something like hug i even get results from tumblr of blogs i follow which may have posted something with hug in their title i dont think phone had all these options edit also while typing on search bar i saw an search on phone option in the bottom of suggestion list clicked on that and the in app feature loaded for me replacing the phone
Android,not_removed,its not the same i already used phone search this is a completly different thing
Android,not_removed,the phone thing is purely on device search this is more detailed
Android,not_removed,same here the tab is called telefon german for phone the ui matches the screenshots and i even got the message detailing the new feature is there actually anything new to it in terms of features looks like just a new ui to me
Android,not_removed,not the same
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,this is so true its the same thing with selecting words in gnot after it scanned the screen why not let us swipe up from the home button from anywhere like it used to work and lift the finger over the desired wordarea to start gnot with eg an instant translationdefinition or a search focused on that area this would be at least times faster and make this feature actually useful
Android,not_removed,and like that isnt enough its the very last tab on the far right and out of view no normals will ever know its there
Android,not_removed,cant google just tell lg no more nexus devices
Android,not_removed,oh my god hangouts search i feel like im taking crazy pills edit after trying this it seems like it only searches locally so not an actual complete hangouts search
Android,not_removed,i regret texting you
Android,not_removed,whatsapp still incompatible
Android,not_removed,mine only seems to work with sms on fb messenger same with yours
Android,not_removed,you and me both brotherlove this phonenexus still doesnt fit as a generic device
Android,not_removed,me too although i find the has a really good shape for a generic android device
Android,not_removed,never ever ever
Android,not_removed,i think the looked really nice
Android,not_removed,thats subjective
Android,not_removed,how did you make the shortcut i cant seem to find an option for that i can use the in apps search but i cant add a shortcut for it
Android,not_removed,if youre talking about the thing on the left corner thats my name in my native language sinhala
Android,not_removed,hahahaha ado
Android,not_removed,i feel like there was an apple lawsuit related to this a few years ago
Android,not_removed,most android phones have the google search app thats my point the second gif shows a search at the top and a search at the bottom
Android,not_removed,thats not true at all stock android has had phone search within the google app for at least the last two software iterations
Android,not_removed,developers have to add the feature but it searches through apps for a specific keyword whats not to understand about it
Android,not_removed,httpiimgurcomjjyodotpng ive had that phone tab doing this for as long as i can remember again nobody probably never noticed this because who actually scrolls to that phone tab when searching and no im not in the google search app beta if that makes a difference
Android,not_removed,my in apps search looks the same httpsimgurcomvjuxbnr
Android,not_removed,if you highlight the text you want to search or whatever in the popup that appears you can go to the overflow menu and select assist and it more or less does a gnot analysis on the selected content
Android,not_removed,coz nothing else in android follows the pattern of action then swipedrop action theyre trying to be consistent in ux with material design now atleast
Android,not_removed,thats my sister lmao the same person who sent me this text when i got the post on reddit a few years ago
Android,not_removed,me irl
Android,not_removed,best looking nexus phone imo in fact i would use a nexus no problem every day if i had one the sparkling glass back adds some uniqueness to it but it still looks pretty minimal overall
Android,not_removed,i definitely agree that its nice although ive sadly never had the chance to have one in hand but my point is that there hasnt been a nicer one since the nexus
Android,not_removed,nah the the all look ugly compared to the am comparing equally priced phones at launch
Android,not_removed,i havent been able to make a shortcut either i thought you meant you hoped the feature as a whole isnt limited to rather than just the shortcut
Android,not_removed,ahh i see thanks
Android,not_removed,there was it was against the galaxy nexus and claimed they couldnt use apples patent on universal interface for retrieval of information in a computer system aka universal search among other things
Android,not_removed,i shouldve said aosp not stock
Android,not_removed,the ui is pretty similar and the new app search features has clearly replaced the old phone search feature but the content is different look at your screenshot its searching things like your gmail contacts this is what phone search has always done its just searching the stuff actually stored in your phones memory the new feature is showing any content google has indexed thats in an app you have installed so it includes any search results from twitter if you have the twitter app installed any search results from facebook if you have facebook installed etc im struggling to think of an app that doesnt have a website that would be indexed for a more obvious example of why this is new but hopefully you get the idea
Android,not_removed,thats the in app tab tho not the phone tab phone search locally in app search on the cloud unless its a contact if i understand correctly
Android,not_removed,idk long pressing is also considered an antipattern because it lacks in discoverability but they choose to use it for gnot also swipeandletgo is used for multiwindow in nougat i dont see a problem with it and it would be sooo much faster
Android,not_removed,shes a winner
Android,not_removed,well shes your sister thats pretty natural
Android,not_removed,okay guys has the final word on what does and doesnt look nice you can move along now
Android,not_removed,i guess you missed the part where he said subjective
Android,not_removed,looks better than the
Android,not_removed,youre just describing app indexing
Android,not_removed,noit shows only apps with app indexing
Android,not_removed,no it searches google app nav drawer settings phone search or tablet search on a tablet again this has always been here part of the app indexing feature devs couldve implemented for a while now i dont use twitter so thats why it doesnt show up in my search results and i dont use the fb app and again why its not in my search results
Android,not_removed,his phone tab and my in apps tab are identical except for the name i dont get what youre saying
Android,not_removed,searching your personal results happens entirely on your phone so you can search even when youre not connected to wifi or cellular data you are not understanding correctly
Android,not_removed,oh wait you witnessed that
Android,not_removed,apparently subjectives new definition is according to standards this is news to me
Android,not_removed,you also missed the part where opinion overrides all subjective opinions mate
Android,not_removed,maybe because it is
Android,not_removed,thats not the same thing i have the android authority app installed on my phone i have never searched for lg before in my life i type lg in the search bar go to the phone tab and it has indexed all the results including articles mentioning the lg from the android authority app it did not do this before if i had typed lg it would find that but this is finding things in apps with the specified key word
Android,not_removed,if he just looked at his own phone tab hed see the same things were seeing

Android,not_removed,thats almost a blackberry level joke pricing
Android,not_removed,no thanks id rather go with or htc or even rather than this at the given price point
Android,not_removed,seems like its for the x performance in us that has the instead
Android,not_removed,oh come on it even surpassed blackberry
Android,not_removed,obviously that seems to be the right choice this is just a mid range phone with high end price sony seems to be adamant on shutting down its mobile division

Android,not_removed,hi recently moving from verizon to tmobile using my verizon phones i found out that perinstalled verizon applications are overheating samsung smartphone cpu to temperatures well over what a cpu can handle to the point of burning out the cpu this has been noticed on samsung note and also currently working on a application to fix this keep posted
Android,not_removed,dont switch trump please its very telling which of your tweets are made from twitter for android vs the ones from other platforms
Android,not_removed,trump is a security threat to the world
Android,not_removed,um what doesnt obama use a special secure samsung galaxy
Android,not_removed,yes and thats what the article says
Android,not_removed,yeah just noticed it didnt read the article when i posted the comment
Android,not_removed,that is something oh well it will grow on me
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,our lineage we started small got big and thought we were at the center of the world and now we are back to being small
Android,not_removed,logos should have quadratic bounds in my opinion this ones too wide and looks like the front view of a plane
Android,not_removed,the original cm logo was ugly as is this one thankfully the logo isnt what makes cmlineage so great so i dont really care
Android,not_removed,looks like the dragfromthebottom google now launch shortcut we used to have in the early days custom roms had options to add more circle targets to the shortcut looks exactly the same
Android,not_removed,directly from github httpsrawgithubusercontentcomlineageoswwwmasterimageslogopng
Android,not_removed,this looks like the logo that should have been for hydrogen os because its kinda like a water particle
Android,not_removed,dont like it
Android,not_removed,it looks clean i guess im not really sure what its supposed to be i feel like it would have looked better if they gave it a circle background
Android,not_removed,reminded me of httpiimgurcombastglggif
Android,not_removed,it reminds me of hardac from batman the animated series httpdcauwikiacomwikihardac
Android,not_removed,it looks like a partial front view of the starship enterprise upside down
Android,not_removed,i think it looks cool
Android,not_removed,itt a bunch of armchair designers some people related to the project said they will do a blog post about the logo
Android,not_removed,i think it looks stupid from the design to the awful color scheme the name was perfectly fine but this design is just awful
Android,not_removed,brainiac is real
Android,not_removed,it looks like the merging of two parts
Android,not_removed,i liked cm logo so i wouldve preferred some modification of that logo and this one kinda lacks face too abstract not what message it holds
Android,not_removed,i think it would look better if it was more triangular to make it look like a binary tree right now it doesnt convey much meaning to me honestly if you showed it to me and asked me what it represented id have no fucking idea aliens
Android,not_removed,i hate that background color just did get used way too much the logo itself isnt that cool but i guess well get used to it
Android,not_removed,at first i thought i was looking at hydrogenos thats the shape of a water molecule
Android,not_removed,kinda sucks
Android,not_removed,vector amoebaos
Android,not_removed,shit name shit logo
Android,not_removed,i want it gone now
Android,not_removed,maybe if we can see the animated version its better than cyanogenmods logo imo
Android,not_removed,looks like that pokemon which name i cant remember at this point
Android,not_removed,i welcome introduction of asymmetry into that design not bad doh
Android,not_removed,i see water
Android,not_removed,looks good its nice simple and symbolic
Android,not_removed,crop circles the aliens are here
Android,not_removed,it kind of lacks anything imo but oh well its just a logo
Android,not_removed,it looks like a jet plane headed straight towards your office window
Android,not_removed,look at some of the biggest logos in the world you will find plenty of nonsquare
Android,not_removed,and its probably going to be displayed in portrait mode in the boot animation
Android,not_removed,i actually kinda miss that thing and adding those shortcuts is there an xposed for this
Android,not_removed,reminds me of brainiac
Android,not_removed,armchair designers so im not allowed to speak my opinion about design anymore okay
Android,not_removed,adding these stupid shadows to everything just screams bad design
Android,not_removed,shadows are still used i thought we went back to flat
Android,not_removed,cant help but imagine something as the oneplus boot animation pretty cool imo
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,its nebby get in the fucking bag
Android,not_removed,unoun
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i agree do they have some sort of logo manifesto or something because to me itd make way more sense and fit with the lineage motif if the circles were increasingly more complex or at least increased in size
Android,not_removed,true although most nonsquare logos tend to be wordmarks to be more precise i think the visual balance is a bit off in this particular logo just doesnt feel right
Android,not_removed,some pie controls app does this edit httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidjunacepiecontrol
Android,not_removed,noooo shadows shitty colors fab material design s
Android,not_removed,some google apps icons are just flat others arent consistency
Android,not_removed,i was thinking
Android,not_removed,yup thats the one
Android,not_removed,unown letter z would be a pretty cool logo
Android,not_removed,the cm logo has always been awful tbh but well at least it wasnt the mixture of flames and red carbon fiber xda folks loved a couple of years ago
Android,not_removed,i would love for them to open up a community contest for logo and bootanimation
Android,not_removed,nike chevrolet jaguar addidas toyota the olympics rolex underarmor playboy tons of famous non square logos that arent wordmarks
Android,not_removed,its off to the bottom because the visual weight of the two stems is towards the bottom but theres nothing to balance it at the top
Android,not_removed,shitty colors that fucking pink and purple color combo even nice material apps are ruined by that candyland shit
Android,not_removed,im talking about the diagonal crap you see on tons of icons nowadays
Android,not_removed,make half shadowed
Android,not_removed,google consistency lol
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,a lot of them could be if stylised properly
Android,not_removed,electric blue of was ok red with skulls or monochrome gradients shudders
Android,not_removed,we did that once back when i was very involved with the project it didnt go well
Android,not_removed,thats a great idea xda projects have always had design issues most projects are done by single developers who havent come near a design class or book in their lifetime and most end up having awful logos and terrible naming they would benefit greatly if they took advantage of their more design savvy users
Android,not_removed,the crossroads of ideas
Android,not_removed,draw a square around them none of those are dramatically far off from a square
Android,not_removed,consistency in switching between the two lol
Android,not_removed,i thought
Android,not_removed,oh yeah i forgot about the chrome skulls on one hand i feel its a shame that material design killed theming but on the other chrome skulls
Android,not_removed,skateboarding andy was hideous imo
Android,not_removed,did the participants vote for the best or just submitted
Android,not_removed,all of those are substantially rectangular at best are you really going to suggest the nike swoosh is not dramatically far from square
Android,not_removed,toyota is literally all curves
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i love this entire thread
Android,not_removed,i was thinking httpiimgurcomahgkibcjpg
Android,not_removed,cm can also mean cheetah mobile which is annoying because cheetah mobile sucks and cyanogenmod is great
Android,not_removed,think he meant cyanogenmod the rom vs cyanogenmod inc the company
Android,not_removed,theyre talking about the outer dimensions not the shapes the logo is made of
Android,not_removed,yeah thats it
Android,not_removed,my favorite pokémon
Android,not_removed,so rare
Android,not_removed,excellent
Android,not_removed,it still wouldnt make sense cyanogenmod and cyanogen inc had different logos what i really think he meant was the old cm logo vs the new one which are both embarrassingly awful
Android,not_removed,it was an awful logo from almost every technical standpoint dont know how is that insulting you or something
Android,not_removed,thanks autocorrect kicked in since i just manually corrected the one above to mod

Android,not_removed,everything about this phone makes me want it more and more now i just gotta wait for them to unlock the bootloader
Android,not_removed,in the second paragraph it says that the axon has a sharper camera than the which from what ive read from all other reviewers seems to be the exact opposite the has a slight edge
Android,not_removed,all day pokemon go hunting has the reviewer actually experienced how much juice that sucks out of a phone that battery will die long before
Android,not_removed,this gets the win for me over the for the sole reason of including expandable storage front facing speakers are just a plus
Android,not_removed,ive never had a phone this big before but i think im going to try this one
Android,not_removed,it looks so beautiful definitely one of my favorite designs ive ever seen on a phone if only it wasnt so big
Android,not_removed,does anyone know if youre canada if theres anyway to get the axon before september or if thats the earliest you can get it the free headphones are nice but not worth the large delay if theres another option imo
Android,not_removed,beautiful phone look forward to a mini with an ips screen
Android,not_removed,you know everything but the notification button and the camera
Android,not_removed,the quickly killed my interest
Android,not_removed,they said in an interview they dont unlock bootloaders
Android,not_removed,honestly i feel that the reviewer equated higher megapixel sharper
Android,not_removed,i had both in good lighting pictures on my sometimes come out sharper than the but this is rarely and only if you pixel peep the lower the lighting the lower the difference and exposure is still wonky on the at times
Android,not_removed,from what i heard is generally better but in perfect lighting it has the slight advantage generally speaking though camera is better
Android,not_removed,the placement of the volume buttons and power button on the side bothers me a lot
Android,not_removed,you clearly have shit taste
Android,not_removed,on newegg if you ordered the gray model before july then they will start shipping on august i preordered on july but the release date for me shows sept
Android,not_removed,swappa but u will pay a small premium
Android,not_removed,id love that i just want a phone to replace my its just too big i thought my was a bit big just hasnt been anything available to compete at a level
Android,not_removed,the camera isnt too bad
Android,not_removed,what notification button
Android,not_removed,why its not that bad even while outdoors on a sunny day
Android,not_removed,wow thats pretty terrible i know amoled isnt going to be crazy bright but thats less than the and the is terrible in sunlight
Android,not_removed,hmm i just looked that up i thought the amoled screen was supposed to be bright nits is like half that of the iphone anyone with the phone care to comment
Android,not_removed,source ive seen one of their tweets saying its not a matter of if but rather when
Android,not_removed,who is they press release ceo pr director
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,same here ordered the grey on july and am seeing september release date i hope they stick to the august date they have in the product description
Android,not_removed,ah thanks probably should just wait then tbh
Android,not_removed,right here with you man
Android,not_removed,yeah its worse than the but its not terrible
Android,not_removed,the licklock screen currently hides notifications behind a little bell icon you have to hit to see them some people are very upset about it
Android,not_removed,i have the axon and the and in direct sunlight the axon is waaay better i mean its not even close i dont know the exact measurements but the axon is significantly more brighter than the
Android,not_removed,yup that quickly makes me not want to touch this phone
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,a support rep yeah lol and people take them seriously
Android,not_removed,you got outshitposted there mate
Android,not_removed,looked like pants in the video i saw of it any sources you can provide id love to love the phone
Android,not_removed,and licking the screen is super unhygienic too
Android,not_removed,thats easily fixable through software they just need to make that an option
Android,not_removed,wow i hadnt heard of that seems really dumb indeed
Android,not_removed,interesting any way you can post a side by side comparison of both phones in the sun on max brightness
Android,not_removed,wish i wouldve read it before buying it
Android,not_removed,as stated in the thread these are the responses from a support rep
Android,not_removed,no joke the is kinda fugly the black one is ok
Android,not_removed,for sure many of the complaints people have had are software fixable which they probably will it just takes some time
Android,not_removed,axon and galaxy httpsimgurcomslvegtw
Android,not_removed,ill see what i can do and post tomorrow
Android,not_removed,is the brightness really that bad in your real world usage
Android,not_removed,awesome thank you can i ask one more favor the axon and in sunlight
Android,not_removed,not for me its been fine
Android,not_removed,it was kind of overcast today so ill do one tomorrow and post
Android,not_removed,awesome man i appreciate you doing that
Android,not_removed,every high end camera manufacturer on the face of the earth uses a bayer cfa aside from fuji and sigma theres a reason they used rgbg the science isnt that humans respond better to green its that the human eye is more sensitive to green than the other colors the dual green sensors are already the luminancesensitive pixels used to gather luminance information this is whats capture by the w in rgbw this is the problem thats been run into with rgbw and other nonbayer filters to get a natural look you need to boost the green channel which introduces more noise you also run into problems needing to write custom demosaicing algorithms which is more work the res triple filtered pixels is a terrible idea thats been played to death you get great results at low isos with plenty of light but once you have to crank up the sensitivity you get flooded with preamp signal noise look at any sigma foveon camera for an example and of course whats the biggest issue with small sensors oh right noise both kodak and sony have played with rgbw and ended up back on bayer and did so for a good reason
Android,not_removed,are there any rgbw smartphones that arent potatoes i know motorola experimented with the moto x to awful results
Android,not_removed,theres a series of videos someone posted here a while ago that i think you would find interesting by a guy named marc levoy
Android,not_removed,uhum yeah uhhuh yep i know some of these words
Android,not_removed,this is why when you zoom into a photo some areas arent very crisp and youll notice sharper greens most of the color information is estimated if i had photoshop i could demonstrate this from a raw picture from my i dont think i can use gimp since it doesnt have native raw support reducing the resolution of a regular image wont show it since rezising it uses color data that has already been interpolated once
Android,not_removed,seperate monochrome sensors are the way to in my opinion
Android,not_removed,question to op aka are these filters physical or just software if its the latter can we get better photosless noisebetter dynamic range when we use another photo app
Android,not_removed,huawei does a monochrome and a bayer rgb they are definitely heading in the right direction and will improve their post processing
Android,not_removed,having a bayer and monochrome wont help that much as you have parallax errors to deal with which reduce accuracy you could go the old ccd route and have a colour splitting prism ultimately bayer is the best way to make images at the moment thats why basically everyone uses it foveon has sensitivity issues rgbw has green channel weakness multiple sensors are large difficult to get accurate you could have a harris shutter then you add mechanical and speed issues
Android,not_removed,those bastards
Android,not_removed,op you have no idea about what youre talking about you could easily google and find out as to why were using bayer
Android,not_removed,fujifilm use their own xtrans colour filter which isnt a grid pattern but still has the same number of colour sites
Android,not_removed,moto x is not that bad
Android,not_removed,the sony and most of their phones this year camera quality is all based around software a good sensor with bad software will take bad pictures there isnt really a thing as a bad sensor
Android,not_removed,thanks looks great
Android,not_removed,interesting af
Android,not_removed,ooh awesome
Android,not_removed,i can recommend it too he is a guy behind pixels hdr btw
Android,not_removed,like red blue green
Android,not_removed,i dont think i can use gimp since it doesnt have native raw support what no way
Android,not_removed,physical thanks so the bayer filter is like the standard ir filter my phone can see remote control leds or the wiibar leds my dslr can not see this i believe the ir filter is just better glass vs plastic i once removed the ir filter from a webcam to have a night vision cam
Android,not_removed,the cfa is physical on highend cameras it is also possible to remove or modify the filter to capture monochrome or ir images
Android,not_removed,the in the was rgbg the in the was rgbg the in the was rgbg as far as i know only the in the xperia xa was rgbm and the from the huawei was rgbm i wouldnt say they really still use them for anything more than entry level crap phones
Android,not_removed,sonys phone cameras are the definition of mediocre
Android,not_removed,op do you really have any idea about what youre talking about
Android,not_removed,thank god we dont use that system then
Android,not_removed,i used a moto x for years before going to the moto x was a great value but the is a ferrari compared to the moto x being a toyota corolla
Android,not_removed,the camera is a big pile of mediocrity
Android,not_removed,there isnt really a thing as a bad sensor this was proved by google when they released hdr
Android,not_removed,no its a plugin that processes the image before importing
Android,not_removed,which cameras have a removable bayer filter
Android,not_removed,thats a software thing the same sensors are used in other phones with much better results i dont know why sonys image processing team is so incompetent
Android,not_removed,mediocre enough to consistently rank on the top of dxomark mobile right
Android,not_removed,pretty much everyone uses sony sensors in their phones
Android,not_removed,note that people prefer the sony sensor too
Android,not_removed,i was all ready to change to this years nexus but pixel is just out of my budget im waiting patiently with this phone till google launches a midrange phone
Android,not_removed,its the software your has a sony sensor
Android,not_removed,in what universe
Android,not_removed,that sounds really weak tbh
Android,not_removed,what is the difference can photoshop mess with the raw parameters like lens distortion and color temperature after you have already edited the image
Android,not_removed,its a custom modification aka voids your warranty but you can find many tutorials on tearing apart a camera and replacing the filter like rental companies also offer ir converted cameras for rent like httpswwwlensrentalscomsearchqirmodified
Android,not_removed,ive spent the morning looking for any source the specifies that sony have not released an official data sheet for the and no one seems to have a tear down of the sensor unless youve got a reputable source its only logical to go with the bulk of evidence and say its rgb with a few pdaf pixels sprinkled in that
Android,not_removed,probably unwillingness to lose sales in their dedicated cameras division whatever the reasoning none of it makes any sense the same company that makes the camera sensors for almost everyone else in the smartphone industry cannot use its existing expertise in its cybershotalpha divisions to create outstanding camera performance on their smartphones its like what happened
Android,not_removed,dxomark i thought we had already accepted that dxomark is a joke and any company who pays them for their consulting service is guaranteed to get a high mark
Android,not_removed,dxomark doesnt mean anything for real world
Android,not_removed,theres nothing there about which is better its preference
Android,not_removed,or you could wait until the drops down into a much more affordable price range too
Android,not_removed,and its junk although the offers a maximum sensor resolution for stills sony set a default jpeg output to keep picture sizes manageable for everyday use you can change to the maximum resolution in the settings menu but as always weve evaluated image quality using the cameras default mode why because the camera flat out sucks at its native output by intentionally gimping the output from to while claiming its for storage space reasons sony has a lot of pixel data to apply software routines on thats why the pics looked so good at its default setting why gimp the default output to because sony much like most android oems skimp on internal storage to save money yet the phones cost no less than other flagship phones at the time of their releases most every other oem who uses sonys camera sensors also apply good camera software to get good pictures out of them which doubly hurts because sony is a big player in the camera space the picture quality generated by the cameras inside sony phones have more in common with the webcams of years past than the companys dedicated ps cameras never mind the prosumer and mirrorlessdslr segments
Android,not_removed,fuck misread that its actually a separate sensor for color temperature
Android,not_removed,as hillarious as your unsourced claim is no we havent
Android,not_removed,sounds like you didnt even bother reading the review its filled with comparison shots and video thats the real world
Android,not_removed,regardless the vast majority of current smart phones use sony sensors including the one in your hand if you got lucky
Android,not_removed,i agree it is still very much a usable and affordable phone if you buy used if someone bought one now they could comfortably use it for the next years
Android,not_removed,i skiped it because of i dont think it would be a good choice in a warm tropical country what do you think of oneplus phones i am not looking into xiaomi because i want something that will have a healthy dev community behind it
Android,not_removed,you seem to completely be missing the point of downsampleing the image to in the first place its partially because images are far more convenient on a mobile but also because its using pixel binning to create a more detailed image than an image alone would skimping out on internal storage the series has standard on some variants and every single xperia phone has had an sd card slot to expand memory far cheaper than many other devices without one i fail to see where youre coming from with that argument comparing the image quality of the latest xperia lenses to webcams is a patently false and ridiculous argument the latest xz is extremely competitive with the performance of the iphone and galaxy
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,why am i lucky to get the sony sensor
Android,not_removed,you seem to completely be missing the point of downsampleing the image to in the first place missed the point sonys smartphone camera software sucks more especially when in anything other than good light nothing to do with being more suitable for mobile consumption and using pixel binning to create a more detailed image when the pictures are posted to ig imgur and others theyre still going to be downsampled anyway the series has standard on some variants and every single xperia phone has had an sd card slot thats skimping on internal storage which doubly hurts when you consider just how high sony prices their flagships because the company still believes the value of its brandimage allows them to charge iphonelevel pricing on their decidedly midrange offerings comparing the image quality of the latest xperia lenses to webcams is a patently false and ridiculous argument moving the goalposts i see
Android,not_removed,because the samsung is rubbish
Android,not_removed,gotta source or are you the one with the xz just saying that
Android,not_removed,i only make superfluous comments when im joking so chill seriously though i have no experience with their current smart phone cameras last samsung i owned was an but their compact cameras arent much good sony and fuji have the compact and mirrorless market cornered also owning an xz doesnt make my opinion any less valid though i guess you might be suspicious of bias my whole point was that most phones have sony sensors including the pixels supposed worlds best smart phone camera its not sonys sensor that you dont like its their image processing
Android,not_removed,auto is the standard mode
Android,not_removed,on any phone only if the phone has is rooted has xposed
Android,not_removed,rooted with xposed

Android,not_removed,nothing new most of this week has just been weak journalism
Android,not_removed,did you turn on the accessibility setting switch access
Android,not_removed,i want one after watching those two lon reviews aliexpress only has the older version in mandarin does walmart ship overseas or where online can i get the orange box version
Android,not_removed,xiaomi is making great products right now best bang for your buck
Android,not_removed,the mibox is a android tv device that will works well for casual users but is not an enthusiasts box so besides a shield what is a reasonably priced enthusiast box
Android,not_removed,i like lon he reviews stuff people actually might buy and he does a great job keep up the good work buddy
Android,not_removed,anyone know if it can do amazon prime streaming too
Android,not_removed,does anyone know if you can hook this up to a nas drive through smb or similar
Android,not_removed,i was so excited to get this but after this review i think im going with the shield tv is nvidia releasing a new one before christmas
Android,not_removed,can i run chrome on it
Android,not_removed,went to walmart yesterday and saw them on the shelf decided to buy one and when i got to the register it wouldnt ring up they eventually figured out they werent for sale yet and took it away
Android,not_removed,really on the fencd with this one but the shield tv is so good as well supports plex media server too any news if theres gonna be a new versio
Android,not_removed,shipped with marshmallow and not nougat hopefully the ota update is ready and will go live when its officially released
Android,not_removed,yeah its not officially out yet when it is i think the google version will be getting sold on their official global store
Android,not_removed,if its the chinese version it will run miui based on regular android not android tv just a heads up
Android,not_removed,you can get a wintel pro for the same price it has two usb ports an ethernet jack a microusb port hdmi audio port microsd reader windows or you can install gnulinux and it looks better imo
Android,not_removed,would like to know that as well one between the two i just want decent playback in plex youtube and netflix paired with a remote and a headphone jack btw are there any android tv devices that support the headphone in the remote thing that would be fucking amazing does this
Android,not_removed,maybe the new shield coming out
Android,not_removed,the answer is in the video no
Android,not_removed,to play media from it yeah with a file manager app
Android,not_removed,its a tv box man i dont get this latest android paranoia and at dont count on getting major version updates
Android,not_removed,are there any boxes with nougat android tv running
Android,not_removed,theres not even any shipping phones with nougat yet only nexus images
Android,not_removed,there is an official global store does it ship internationally url i have been checking the countryspecific store and it is crap almost everything out of stock and quite ancient offerings
Android,not_removed,thanks for the warning almost bought it
Android,not_removed,i meant xiaomi in general their phones tablets and laptops are solid products
Android,not_removed,it also doesnt run android tv
Android,not_removed,nvidia shield supports this via its controller and remote
Android,not_removed,might be able to rig something together using bubbleupnp or localcast and your phone i know localcast has an option to listen through the phones headphone jack while casting video to a chromecast
Android,not_removed,btw are there any android tv devices that support the headphone in the remote thing that would be fucking amazing does this not to my knowledge roku makes one but fuck roku anyway
Android,not_removed,what
Android,not_removed,its an android device that presumably will be connected to your network security is not paranoia
Android,not_removed,they did say it will get software updates and is a big deal because of hdr and pip
Android,not_removed,fuck me for expecting a product announced at the nougat event that is being released well after nougat has been officially out to have nougat right its not a paranoia its about having the best software for the box and nougat runs better on the tv box than marshmallow
Android,not_removed,you realise this is randroid right
Android,not_removed,the nexus player has nougat
Android,not_removed,they dont sell much internationally imo httpwwwmicomenstore
Android,not_removed,what can android do that windowslinuxkodi cant
Android,not_removed,damn the shield with the remote isnt available anymore how much are these that would be really amazing to be honest
Android,not_removed,yes thats true but there is no autosync between audio and video unfortunately you have to manually adjust them
Android,not_removed,not available in germany anyway just curious why do you hate it and doesnt the shield do something like that that really is a feature that would make me churn out € and ditch my chromecast in a heartbeat
Android,not_removed,there is a new shield tv about to be released
Android,not_removed,youre pulling straws here there so much to rebut what you said but ill throw a few simple ones security updates and major os version upgrades are two completely different things xiaomi is well known to frequently update miui and never android version on its nonflagship devices there are hundreds of millions of phones running a less uptodate os than this device and there has been a long time since a security breach in android has been reported especially for a severely limited tv box and even if the mibox is breached the threat is much less severe than in a personal communication device if your security needs are that high and you dont have the means of a programmable router to keep the device isolated than maybe you shouldnt introduce a chinese box in that network
Android,not_removed,rip mibox trying to run an hdr video with pip overlay
Android,not_removed,that isnt even sold anymore which is sad google has an os that they made that only runs on a device that isnt sold anymore imagine if microsoft made windows but it only ran on discontinued gateway machines
Android,not_removed,the shipping section only talks about the us though
Android,not_removed,provide a nice built for tv interface google cast seems to be the bigger ones to me
Android,not_removed,can this run kodi too
Android,not_removed,does it have netflix and vudu most do not from what i have heard
Android,not_removed,i think remotes are like alone maybe cheaper on ebayused
Android,not_removed,getting an app to run naitively on the roku devices is just a hassle
Android,not_removed,yes theres a difference between security updates and os upgrades except when said security updates are only available via the new os version and your oem doesnt back port the fixes now xiaomi being relatively good about security patches doesnt really make security mindedness a paranoia as for android security issues being a thing of the past well thats objectively absurd
Android,not_removed,the shield tv doesnt have it officially yet but it looks like theyre prepping a beta preview theres a forum post from nvidia about a shield experience preview program
Android,not_removed,they do uk and europe too may need a google its all still in dollarydoos though
Android,not_removed,kodi interface looks better and is more customizable kodi with yaste or pushbullet will give you google cast functionality can i ask what use case you have with google cast ive never used it because ive never found the use of it if im watching a youtube video on my phone im on the go if im at home im watching a movieshow either on my tv or on my desktop android is a downside as far as im concerned if you ever want to just browse the web the experience will be worse you wont get any updates because of planned obsolescence so apps will no longer support your os as time goes on
Android,not_removed,you can run kodi on any machine that runs windowslinuxandroid so to answer your question yes it can run kodi
Android,not_removed,from my quick googlefu this device cant play netflix either apparently only preapproved devices can play netflix
Android,not_removed,damn thanks that makes this thing pretty expensive though
Android,not_removed,do you have a link cant seem to find it on their forums and if the shield beats the mi box ill bite does netflix instant play work on it edit the version numbers for the shield dint march up with aosp for whatever illogical reason
Android,not_removed,they do uk great
Android,not_removed,welp there wasnt much chances of getting it shipped to argentina officially anyway i guess ill have to wait until someone imports them here
Android,not_removed,its much easier search things up on the phone and cast it to tv rather than search them on the tv with a nonqwerty remote
Android,not_removed,i have no use for a google cast myself but my father has really appreciated the one i got him hes technologically inept so the simple easyness of google cast is simple enough to understand just hit the cast button
Android,not_removed,browsing for something to watch on a phone is miles ahead of navigating the mess of an interface that kodi is
Android,not_removed,yeah nvidias stuff aint cheap but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of qualityperformancefeatures with it worth it if you can get over the initial stickershock
Android,not_removed,heres the post its a first come first serve sign up thingy no idea how many people have actually signed up its not out yet so no idea on the other things edit not sure what instant play is
Android,not_removed,i bet aliexpress would be cheaper when its available on the mi store there anyway i tend to buy all my xiaomi stuff from there
Android,not_removed,as someone that has compiled openelec from scratch to create kodi mediacenters you are utterly deluded how am i deluded what can google cast do that kodipushbullet cant
Android,not_removed,its much easier search things up on the phone and cast it to tv if it works and just doesnt stop randomly and then requires unplugging before working again i have two chromecasts that do this regularly
Android,not_removed,ah i use one of those
Android,not_removed,kodi is literally two clicks or sometimes one click if its a recent show to watch what i want i highly doubt it
Android,not_removed,€ is just too much to be honest ill keep waiting then damn
Android,not_removed,basically any commercially available streaming service id been an xbmc user for many many years these arent comparable products
Android,not_removed,my phones sometimes get disconnected while casting and in that case i have to pauseplay using tv remote but when that happens it continues playing on the chromecast and i never plugunplug for anything it also depends on the app the issue only occurs on some apps im not sure what your issue is but you should look into whether its a router issue instead which is disconnecting your chromecasts from the internet you should also try using the dongle that came with it which improves connectivity
Android,not_removed,ah but to be honest the whole set up with kodi and everything seems way too much hassle compared to an out of box experience with android tv plus the fact that android tv has official apps available that windows does not
Android,not_removed,that is most definitely not guest or wife friendly at all
Android,not_removed,i can now navigate around well enough now but kodi is about as far from intuitive navigational design as any other major piece of software ive used finding the spot to add a repository is different in every single skin and ive yet to use one let alone the defaults that that stuff is easily accessible
Android,not_removed,ok now im curious what are the two clicks
Android,not_removed,youre probably correct that its my router or something thing is i dont care im not going to go mess about with things like that when i just want things to just work i now have a tv that streams from the network an old apple tv and a cheap android box that runs kodi all of these things work with no problem the chromecasts have been given away to relatives one seems to work ok while the other is still playing silly buggers
Android,not_removed,fair enough id probably go with android myself if i didnt have to worry about buying another device in a couple of years
Android,not_removed,your wife doesnt know how and cant learn how to use a wii
Android,not_removed,i guess everyones opinion is different but i dont find it confusing i guess you can add the repo you need before applying skins
Android,not_removed,movie select movie or alternatively tv select show select episode
Android,not_removed,yeah ultimately the device that works best with someones situation is the one thats best for them for me chromecast works perfectly to suit my needs and android tv would be excellent while for you an android box with kodi works best and thats fine
Android,not_removed,which chrome cast first or second gen
Android,not_removed,erm im going to say first gen because i dont know and i bought them originally ages ago
Android,not_removed,if thats the case check your qos settings on the router ive had some random issues due to qos conflicting with the first gen chromecast
Android,not_removed,i have qos turned off due to every it guy i know saying its nastydangerous to have it enabled would this have stopped them working reliably do you think
Android,not_removed,possibly it depends a lot on your setup
Android,not_removed,nova too
Android,not_removed,gnl works as well
Android,not_removed,mind blown
Android,not_removed,pretty handy for the play store to go directly to installed apps for updates thanks op
Android,not_removed,is this home screen routed or what it looks so much different than my nexus
Android,not_removed,let the shtposting begin
Android,not_removed,i know im gonna go back to nova at some point but for now the simplicity of the pixel launcher is nice to have
Android,not_removed,good to know
Android,not_removed,this is awesome
Android,not_removed,yeah as someone who always turns off automatic updates this is the main thing i use it for i still update my apps daily just want to keep an eye on the changelogs when available
Android,not_removed,i just manually blurred the wallpaper im using for my lock screen to make the icons pop more once the phone is unlocked while keeping the detail in the lock screen cant recall where i got the original but here are both
Android,not_removed,its a rooted nexus running with the screen settings set to small to get rows of icons pixel launcher defaults to on the with stock dpi the shortcuts trick works on stock just as well though and apparently on some other launchers too
Android,not_removed,because detecting earths magnetic field accurately is hard your best real compass is made of minimal metal and you use it in the middle of nowhere near no electronics or anything that sets up confusing em fields compasses used for navigation in aircraft and ships are mounted way away from everything else and are calibrated specifically for the structure around them the magnetometer in your phone has to deal with multiple radios within centimeters blasting out em radiation and metallic objects all over the place that are causing weird reflections its like trying to listen to a whispering man sitting on the other side of the room while theres a fullon rock concert going on
Android,not_removed,i work with magnetometers a fair amount there are two things that can really affect compass readings hard iron and soft iron errors if you look at a perfectly calibrated compass output at all points it would form a perfect sphere with a radius equal to the magnetometer xyz magnitude hard iron effects are a constant static interference applied to the compass they cause the perfect sphere to be offset from the origin this is usually due to how the magnetometer is installed its also easy to fix by a simple realignment and only needs to be done once typically soft iron errors are dynamic effects such as walking past a large metal or something that affects the local magnetic field this causes the sphere to turn into more of an ellipse there are some sphere fitting algorithms that can be used to correct this but the math is a bit involved this calibration needs to be done ondemand if there is some interference most compasses probably account for hard iron effects at best soft iron can happen in many places and can really mess up your heading readings
Android,not_removed,my nexus has had correct accuracy never in its existence
Android,not_removed,not to seem pro apple trust me im not but how are the new iphone compasses so good no calibration solid tracking and accurate why is that whereas most android compasses are for the most part garbage
Android,not_removed,my nexus has the worst compass of any phone i have ever used
Android,not_removed,iphone compasses work great and only require calibration once in a blue moon all android phones ive ever used including my current nexus have completely crap compasses its like android companies are still in the horse and buggy era of phone compasses while apple is sourcing bmw level compasses
Android,not_removed,can somebody recommend a way to calibrate the compass with an app thats not a scam
Android,not_removed,how where do you calibrate the compass the figure is always such an incomplete and vague description that i never know if im doing it right
Android,not_removed,because there is no demand for high precision compasses on smartphones until now
Android,not_removed,my edge screen compass is relatively accurate seems to be within ° not sure if it has any better compass than other phones though
Android,not_removed,my droid bionic had a great compass only had to calibrate it once and it worked great my nexus on the other hand any time i want it to have the right direction i have to calibrate it
Android,not_removed,the phone is in space but we get around that with algorithms that take accelerometer readings into account this is one of the things calibration takes care of your phone is generating its own magnetic field with all the electricity flowing through it when a electron is in motion a magnetic field is generated especially in a small circuit where inductors and coils are key to making it power efficient and filter analog noise so a small bit of the magnetic field is generated by the phone and it changes according to how hard the phone is working your phone has at least magnets in it already probably more around or seeing as how speakers and mics are made of magnets this is of course part of what calibration takes care of the earths magnetic field is not entirely uniform a database of field strength and direction for each point on earth is required for the best measurement but you shouldnt worry about it because even geolocation via cell towers can take care of this we have solutions for most of these problems but it doesnt mean we have perfect solutions
Android,not_removed,my compass seems perfect fast responsive and accurate
Android,not_removed,compass seems pretty perfect probably degree difference
Android,not_removed,mine works perfect
Android,not_removed,lol the moto doesnt even seem to have a compass tried apps and they all say theres no compass theres also no stock app for it
Android,not_removed,i had a wtf moment with my androids compass just yesterday trying to align my attic mounted tv antenna based on tv fool info had i relied strictly on the compass my days of watching beverly hillbillies reruns would of tragically been over
Android,not_removed,the most accurate gps i ever had on a phone oddly enough was my which is funny because you couldnt even make use of that feature until years after its life cycle the compass and the gps got crazy accurate though i figured that with all the other things the phone was bad at that everything would improve once i upgrade but ive since yet to get a phone that pin points me as fast or knows which way im looking
Android,not_removed,serious question how do you know your compass is bad are you comparing it side by side with a conventional compass in an urban environment the amount of metal surrounding the compass would tend to make it inaccurate
Android,not_removed,he even without asking thx
Android,not_removed,follow this only downside is that youll find yourself doing this often
Android,not_removed,mine seems to be reliably wrong to the degree i will go the opposite way
Android,not_removed,same as my nexus along with the dogshit camera every nexus phone has awful compromises that no one mentions
Android,not_removed,have you tried drawing the figure helped me
Android,not_removed,yep i get the calibration pop up on my at least once a week i recently installed an android auto head unit in my car that has its own gps and compass module and its been nice to actually have google maps know what direction im facing since it uses the kenwood gps when its plugged into my car
Android,not_removed,hasnt been my experience especially with gps end up getting extremely frustrated when my friends attempt navigating hikingbiking routes and end up pulling out my
Android,not_removed,while apple software leaves things to be desired they do have toptier storage at time of release toptier socs at time of release toptier camera hardware and software minimal janklag strong battery life and together these create fluid and relatively consistent experiences and people will pay for that as apple has found out ive had one iphone and four android phones in some ways you get what you pay for iphones usually are the real neversettle in terms of phone hardware
Android,not_removed,thats a shame
Android,not_removed,try the movements in there you dont really need an app
Android,not_removed,google maps say tilt your phone forward and back move it side to side and then tilt left and right source
Android,not_removed,it requires a flip down which most of those useless animations dont convey
Android,not_removed,until now i do t think there is now either
Android,not_removed,after calibration i assume
Android,not_removed,edge here my compass is completely random and calibration only lasts like seconds maybe
Android,not_removed,yeah motorola has this bad habit of randomly removing sensors admittedly cheap but i never knew it was going to be missing the gyroscope
Android,not_removed,one way to tell is that its facing backwards or sideways while navigating youre driving forward and the phone is facing forward but the map points sideways particularly when walking since the maps app usually figures out which way youre facing if youre moving fast enough
Android,not_removed,i checked the compass on the map
Android,not_removed,my city is laid put on a perfect northsouth and eastwest grid and the mountains are always visible to the west in my case direction is always fairly easy to determine my note has a very accurate compass as far as i can tell
Android,not_removed,that totally worked on my htc i never had success with that figure routine this video spin the phone flat on the desk then do that odd twirling holding it in your hand bang calibrated
Android,not_removed,one of the many weaknesses reviewers dont pick up about the
Android,not_removed,like everything else in the it was built at a cutrate price the compass and noise cancelling mic are the biggest examples
Android,not_removed,precise but inaccurate
Android,not_removed,i have used my brothers iphone se recently running ios beta and the compass app runs perfect never requires calibration and is rock on i have never seen the calibration screen yet on this newer phone though i used to see it every time i opened the compass in older phones
Android,not_removed,and then this guy
Android,not_removed,strong battery life has never been an iphone talking point except for the plus series strong standby battery life sure but actual use even apple acknowledged that by releasing a battery case
Android,not_removed,theres still not a single compass app on android that works that smooth sad
Android,not_removed,pokémon go though there is some benefit to it not being so accurate
Android,not_removed,i calibrated it didnt seem to make much difference
Android,not_removed,gyroscope and compass are two things they would never remove the gyroscope the phone wouldnt even know if you rotated the phone or not they removed the compass only
Android,not_removed,every damn time this happens when walking and using google maps im better just closing the app and asking people nearby for directions because for some seconds it could mislead you
Android,not_removed,you took a bearing using a conventional compass and map onto an object then you took a bearing on the same object using your phone what sort of difference in degreesmils did you get
Android,not_removed,hmm please show me an andrdoid phone with the battery life of an iphone and similar hardwarestoragecameraui performance ill be waiting if you find it let me know actual use is goddamn stellar
Android,not_removed,i gave up on it i just know the arrow is going to be pointing slightly off
Android,not_removed,pokemon go doesnt really make use of the compass
Android,not_removed,gyroscope and compass are two things they would never remove the gyroscope the phone wouldnt even know if you rotated the phone or not they removed the compass only you have idea what im talking about why do people like you post things so confidently if you dont take a moment to google it it wouldve taken you httplmgtfycomqmotophonenogyroscope to verify what i was saying but instead you thought you were right and posted it anyways the state of randroid these days fyi they use the accelerometer to determine whether youve rotated the phone
Android,not_removed,no i opened google maps and checked whether the compass arrow agrees with the direction i am facing the error for a calibrated compass is sometimes up to deg
Android,not_removed,could be might also be iterfereence id line to test that se in an are with more iterfereence than usual to see if it has to calibrate but dont know if ill be able to find a place and be able to get the phone to try
Android,not_removed,xperia compact iphones have never had good battery most iphone users would agree with that its only recently that they could complete with android phones in sot iphones are good at video playback on battery for whatever reason though
Android,not_removed,it does in order to use the ar mode
Android,not_removed,it does use it though you can click the compass icon and move the view around with it
Android,not_removed,i misunderstood your checking method i used to do orienteering with old school map and compass i guess modern tech doesnt always surpass the olde ways being degrees out in the welsh mountains would be a disaster
Android,not_removed,huh that phone hit none of the marks haha except size and battery life far slower soc far slower storage far worse camera and close on the ui its only recently that they could complete with android phones in sot iphones are good at video playback on battery for whatever reason though i think you completely ignored the link i sent which is web browsingyou know sot come on man at least read what im writing who are you replying to
Android,not_removed,nope thats the gyroscope
Android,not_removed,idk why you got downvoted this is true
Android,not_removed,definitely a classic compass is orders of magnitude better then a smartphone compass i used to do the same in the boy scouts theres certain magic to it thats lost with modern electronics
Android,not_removed,it uses both edit to elaborate the compass is used to figure out what direction youre facing in ar its why you have to turn around to see some pokemon i know this personally because when my compass was bugging out on my phone ar would either not work or make the pokemon fly across the screen jittering
Android,not_removed,because it uses the gyroscope for it hence the sensor drift
Android,not_removed,no my moto doesnt have a compass and ar mode works just fine ar mode only needs the gyroscope
Android,not_removed,it uses both gyroscope for movement compassmagnetometer for calibration
Android,not_removed,but the compass will tell the phone where youre moving from if the accelerometer detects you have turned degrees to the right what direction are you facing i dont know we need the compass to tell us what direction you were looking at in the first place
Android,not_removed,lots of apps that can potentially have features compromised video streaming banking etc do this to test if a phone has root abilities if they request from a phone with superuser access either an accept or decline is noticed with a phone without root the request returns null thus the app in question knows whether or not to give you features that may be compromised with root access
Android,not_removed,im more than confident that this is the way to crack down on rooted users uk banks take it very seriously and if your phone is rooted the app resets and stops working instantly for security reasons barclays in particular manages to check for root even without a permission request but in your case it probably will stop working if you allow it root
Android,not_removed,id make sure the app wasnt compromised in some way
Android,not_removed,chase mobile app does the same thing
Android,not_removed,i emailed the developers at apg letting them know and await a follow up email uh oh i hope the reply isnt thanks for letting us know for your security we have disabled mobile access to your account since you have informed us your device is insecure
Android,not_removed,if i live in material design ok
Android,not_removed,i denied root permanently and it allowed me into the app so im good for now
Android,not_removed,ah yes but thats why i emailed them via pc with an email that doesnt represent my google account or apg login
Android,not_removed,for clarification im not a techy so this might sound like something out of a movie but i was just worried that someone mightve put malware or some sort of tracking software on phone

Android,not_removed,tldw you plug a wireless receiver into your phone and hide it under a case you have to unplug the wireless receiver to charge with a cable trading access to your charging port for wireless charging is somehow an acceptable tradeoff
Android,not_removed,its good for charging over night
Android,not_removed,eh i normally fall asleep listening to a podcast or something so it wont ever be a viable option for me
Android,not_removed,so i get out of my car unplug my car charger go into the house and eat dinner plug my wireless charger dongle thats been hanging off my phone awkwardly into the slot then set the phone on the mat or do i leave it plugged in all the time so when i need to plug it in at work or in the car i have to first unplug the wireless bit i wont pretend its unusable but i also wont pretend that its ergonomic or reasonable to have to do that on a daily basis especially in the age of type c cables
Android,not_removed,why wont it you dont use wireless headphones
Android,not_removed,lol what do you do in the morning if you need your battery to be at
Android,not_removed,in all honesty its hard to know if charging your phone constantly while at will damage the battery or not ive heard many different opinions on it some say that it cant hurt your device while others say the opposite the way id use this is only apply it when i want to charge so at night just before id sleep i would apply this and let it charge overnight
Android,not_removed,no for a few reasons they would almost be dead by the time i woke up and that would be yet another thing i have to charge daily a pair of bt earbuds sounds worse than a good pair of wired ones also they have a shorter lifespan easier to lose and more fragile
Android,not_removed,wake up go to classes stream music the entire day use phone regularly
Android,not_removed,so at night just before id sleep i would apply this and let it charge overnight thats exactly the same as just plugging it in with a cable this doesnt save any steps in the process and just adds more
Android,not_removed,you do you i just feel like the whole point of wireless charging is to remove steps from the charging process not add them if i wanted to charge slow i would buy an old wall wart and plug my cable into that for bedside use theres no damage to be had from leaving a battery at and any battery damage from the trickle charging between that happens overnight isnt a threat in the years i might own a phone and definitely isnt worth the inconvenience of having to fuck with it for a few seconds before bed every night
Android,not_removed,what phone do you have
Android,not_removed,i dont think it does if youre just charging your phone through the plug anyway
Android,not_removed,todays smartphones stop pulling power in once they are fully charged so leaving them plugged in when at does not hurt the battery
Android,not_removed,yep so only decent battery life edit also connected to two bluetooth devices at all times watch and tile and have location services always on
Android,not_removed,nice im using a running a custom rom and kernel pure nexus and franco
Android,not_removed,you can use automate to change the location from high to battery saving when using snapchat that solves the gps issue without nerfing it
Android,not_removed,but id feel so bad for depriving them of additional personal information
Android,not_removed,i uninstalled snapchat it drains too much battery and constantly deletes messages before i read them
Android,not_removed,or just get a better phone
Android,not_removed,could you share how you did this
Android,not_removed,does this require root i want to automate turning gps onoff when turning waze onoff
Android,not_removed,thats why i made my username my social security number so i never forget it
Android,not_removed,it differs a lot on every android phone my runs it fine but my brother has issues on his
Android,not_removed,hey guys lets buy a better phone for just a social media app
Android,not_removed,this is the flowchart gps saver kicks in first and start gps high in a loop i think it can be done with only one task but i didnt try hard enough to make it work httpimgurcomaosqqt
Android,not_removed,yes forgot about that
Android,not_removed,that would be amazing for waze
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,lol no lets buy a better phone because its a better phone and can actually run simple apps like snapchat without needing a restart after use nexus is a horrible phone
Android,not_removed,interesting thanks
Android,not_removed,that is a really great opinion of yours yes but it holds value
Android,not_removed,eh my runs it just fine
Android,not_removed,i wish my comments could add as much value to the discussion as yours

Android,not_removed,isnt that what google trips is meant to do link me google trips
Android,not_removed,final your route such english much good seriously though this is the task google trips is designed to handle for you i travel to new countries once or twice a month and though trips isnt perfect it is really good add in sharable lists in maps and you really dont need keep
Android,not_removed,what a stupid article
Android,not_removed,httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappstravelonthego free rating search for google trips on the httpsplaygooglecomstoresearchqgoogletrips httpsgithubcomcrisbalplaystorelinksbot
Android,not_removed,literally stickied right at the top of this subreddit
Android,not_removed,honestly lack of aside this looks like an awesome phone from lg they seem to have really stepped up their game with this one hopefully it wont have bootloop issues and in a few months after a price dropdeals it could be a really awesome phone for a good price of course better wait for the competitions offerings before pulling the trigger
Android,not_removed,how much do you think theyll give me for cents s
Android,not_removed,oh shit maybe now i have a better use than just buying movies
Android,not_removed,i really wish if they make it like inapp purchases from google play store instead of redirecting to a webpage i think it will be more cleaner and consistent with other apps i will be able to purchase the storage using my sim card balance i cant do that from the webpage and i dont have a cc but hey at least they improved something
Android,not_removed,great tip cheers
Android,not_removed,doesnt work for me i bought a bunch of credit for the plan only to find you cant pay for it via credit a few weeks ago went and checked again and i still cant maybe its a staged rollout
Android,not_removed,oh great right after they stopped giving reward surveys to most people lol
Android,not_removed,im more interested about whats up with the shadow on your status bar
Android,not_removed,great because i have my google reward money just sitting around and i dont really buy apps
Android,not_removed,it only shows my credit cards as options to pay
Android,not_removed,im gonna say i willed this into existence because the other day i was looking at the storage tiers and thought i wonder if i can pay this with my survey credits
Android,not_removed,i tried but it didnt allow me to use it i was able to charge my sprint account though which is just as good
Android,not_removed,play credits can also pay for the play music plan thanks to two chromecast credits ive got enough to cover almost three months of the family plan
Android,not_removed,makes sense to me you can pay your all access subscription with it too
Android,not_removed,sadly not for me
Android,not_removed,unrelated but what do you all store on google drive to warrant the extra space i have of space on there free from google fiber but im unsure how to utilize it i have a pixel xl so my google photos storage is unlimited
Android,not_removed,this work for g suite accounts too
Android,not_removed,i get to play with google play balance but sadly its restricting me from doing so
Android,not_removed,hmm cool but i still have so many promos active i dont think l will need to pay for a long time
Android,not_removed,wait seriously ive been trying for ages and the fact you couldnt use your play balance was the only thing stopping me
Android,not_removed,thanks for the replies everyone and thanks for the pm also i am hopefully getting somewhere with this so im not going to write back until tomorrow when ive a full update essentially i was being fed a script and the like and had a lot of back and forth but should get somewhere when they realised that i knew what i was talking about and is very tech savvy the tune changed i will reply in full with details when i hear
Android,not_removed,well lets do the math i believe for you get or so youll get is or however the next step up gives you a slightly better deal at for or which leaves us at or under that model will give you edit drunk numbaring
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i buy last pass premium with my rewards credit
Android,not_removed,new subscriptions are done through the play store now and youre existing subscription will be migrated to the play store very soon
Android,not_removed,works for me maybe its ab testing
Android,not_removed,confirmed we are testing it now and its enabled for of users look for a wider rollout next year
Android,not_removed,make it to level in google maps and a terabyte for free
Android,not_removed,im pretty sure they werent going to let people use survey money for this anyways they dont allow it for google play music
Android,not_removed,its just flat style colored bar xposed module
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,personally i use google drive for my school i have all the lectures hws and notes from each class in an individual folder and i put them in the same semester etc since my is running out so thats why i upgraded to because google dont have the option for storage between and so i guess thats the reason you see people getting plan even though they only need lets say
Android,not_removed,dont all g suite accounts have unlimited storage
Android,not_removed,any promos that anyone else can take advantage of
Android,not_removed,still nothing here im due to be billed soon and thatll mean another usd transaction charge im thinking of reaching out to support
Android,not_removed,update added thanks
Android,not_removed,nothing uet update to follow shortly playing hard ball
Android,not_removed,is for gigs
Android,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
Android,not_removed,why do you need premium anymore
Android,not_removed,last pass pre i stopped getting reward questions last time i got one was back in october
Android,not_removed,i get the play store window but it is inside a webpage and httpiimgurcomcqmchuspng but what i mean by making it inapp purchase is httpiimgurcomnwdmzqjjpg i hope you got my idea
Android,not_removed,probably yeah ah well ill wait
Android,not_removed,true but it expires after years which is kind of lame
Android,not_removed,ehh im fine with paying a month for
Android,not_removed,you could always buy a hard drive and a nas
Android,not_removed,not officially confirmed but everybody ive talked to about it and heard from is getting nonewayy less including myself ive never answered dishonestly either
Android,not_removed,g suite unlimited accounts do basic g suite accounts have instead of the normal that basic gmail gives you g suite unlimited is versus and its not true true unlimited from what ive heard its something closer to or so or you can get into some hot water when you start crossing a few tb idk
Android,not_removed,free ones dont thats for sure
Android,not_removed,now its working i made several calls and emails to google play support from the drive team to the billing team they confirmed that the email was them and that it was factual but they didnt give me anymore help apart from that i was being passed from billy to jack the entire time it appears that the support staff were in the dark on it i cancelled my google drive upgraded storage it expired on february now this morning i opened drive to see my balance reset to with my account being percent over i opened the upgrade options all now listed in euro € tax working out around € so it appears that it is activated once your period is renewed maybe that can help people ironically ive since stated dabbling in google cloud storage amazon and backblaze where its only per gb per month so ive really got to reconsider how im going to move forward with my storage needs tldr cancel your storage and renew again
Android,not_removed,oh shit i mathed this wrong im a bit new years drunk so lets try this again drunk math is best math after all sooo is so so for you get mb or i was only off by a notation i was better than i would have expected to be
Android,not_removed,isnt premium ad free
Android,not_removed,now that sync to mobile is free not really
Android,not_removed,if you did a factory reset or anything make sure to open it up and register again most of my questions are just asking if i visited a particular store
Android,not_removed,yeah the drive team actually has enabled the native in app purchase flow your second screenshot but they recently had to disable it for some users due to technical reasons theyre working on re enabling it soon that first screenshot is the mobile web version of the play store so although it looks a bit different youre still signing up through play source i work on the play iab and subs platform
Android,not_removed,same here in feb
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,crap didnt know that
Android,not_removed,how easily hackable is it
Android,not_removed,in order to get above you must have at least unlimited accounts on the domain
Android,not_removed,thats bizarre i received an email stating that it was starting in january strange why it hasnt kicked in once im home im going to request a support call ill update you
Android,not_removed,oh it says your premium trial will expire in days for me so it enrolled me automatically for a trial and thats why sync works
Android,not_removed,how do you register again it simply logs me in
Android,not_removed,i understand you thanks for your help the thing is i cant use the sim card balance to purchase stuff from the web version but i can from the inapp purchases
Android,not_removed,two years if you qualified when it was still a terabyte also tier
Android,not_removed,it depends on what platform you use and how you set up your network the only way to eliminate worries about hacking security and privacy is to learn learn learn learn as much as you can about everything and build things yourself if you just throw your hands up in the air and go with a popular solution you are completely reliant on the way they decide to handle your data you have to keep track of how your selected service changes over time which means you need to constantly spend time learning about any changes they make anyway why not put that effort into building your own solution that you have almost complete control over
Android,not_removed,thats the official rule but if if you have just one user youll get unlimited storage too just head on over to rdatahoarder for proof i did the trial of upgrading my free g suite account used just so i can have a custom email with my personal domain and i was given unlimited storage i didnt continue it because i still have unlimited through my old university gmail that i get to keep forever
Android,not_removed,i think sync works nevertheless but what the differences are i dont know
Android,not_removed,understood its not a perfect solution but you can sign up for the plan pay the first month then open the play store on your device and update the payment method to dcb hopefully the drive team will be able to reenable the native flow soon though
Android,not_removed,that makes sense thanks ill consider it
Android,not_removed,oh i did not know thanks
Android,not_removed,please do pm
Android,not_removed,thanks for your help i hope that they reenable it soon oh and one more question do the drive team have any plans to implement sync feature with the device folders
Android,not_removed,man had to use google a lot just to figure out how to get carrier billing for google drive tried this and it worked thank you so very much would be great if you could let the driveplay store team know that direct carrier billing from the start is still in demand wouldve saved me some dough
Android,not_removed,no prob seafile and owncloud are both solid beginner solutions give them a try and see what works best for you
Android,not_removed,thanks for suggestion ill try if i set up the nas
Android,not_removed,i still havent got the one where you can opt into betas edit haha just got it today
Android,not_removed,im pretty interested in more efficient data loading thats for sure
Android,not_removed,how is this new android police covered this stuff last year all of the store types are coming someday
Android,not_removed,uhhh we have known for months that all google play purchases including music movies and apps would be shared this is not news
Android,not_removed,how about they first rollout family plans to everyone and then start expanding on that salty
Android,not_removed,still cant gift purchases to other people which is super lame
Android,not_removed,family shared play music account is already a thing since a lot of time and its already confirmed that well also get play store shared purchases in july any purchase from july the will be eligible as a family purchase
Android,not_removed,i got it this morning
Android,not_removed,it will be live in a couple of days if nothing changes
Android,not_removed,it will be included at launch this article is not accurate
Android,not_removed,and let us share subscriptions like hbo now it pisses me off to no end that i cant just subscribe to hbo and let everyone in my family use it on any tv in the house
Android,not_removed,my first song always stutters i have to skip it or pause it and let it buffer all the way through
Android,not_removed,is there any word on whether existing musicmovies etc bought before july would be eligible it would be really stupid if they werent
Android,not_removed,i got it last night i was mildly surprised
Android,not_removed,yeah just checked and same nice surprise
Android,not_removed,or my personal favorite the spinning circle on cached music guaranteed second delay even when offline whats not to love
Android,not_removed,the developer has the choice its mandatory for purchases after july but they have to enable sharing for purchases prior
Android,not_removed,yeah they probably are hbo needs to fix this not google

Android,not_removed,i tried to its too laggy and stutters after a while try again with or
Android,not_removed,i do right now but im about to roll back performance is as expected really inconsistent
Android,not_removed,no and dont its not made for that and youll just make your phone overall shittier until its a stable release
Android,not_removed,i used it for a week and actually found it crazy smooth battery life was also really good even though no apps have implemented background restrictions yet as they dont target the new api level rolled back to yesterday though because connectivity was really buggy every time i turned the screen off it disconnected from my wifi network it also didnt seem to work at all on my friends ac wireless network and it often didnt show all networks for some reason when i went into wifi settings bluetooth often crashed and had to be force closed o preview is a lot more stable than n preview was so i suspect when preview comes out it will become my daily driver but until then i need working wifi on my phone
Android,not_removed,ok then ill wait til then
Android,not_removed,it was alright on my nexus but at some point i stopped getting mobile data on tmobile something a lot of tmobile users are reporting its a beta so stuff like this is expected it was very smooth imo i cant wait for final release
Android,not_removed,i am really havent had any issues with performance but there is a bit of jank here and there very few apps outright crash more than normal at least i have a few visual issues with action launcher and trying to open pdfs causes the phone to hard lock which isnt a huge deal to me i dont read pdfs that often the only way id go back to n is if linageos for the pixel gets nightlies soon
Android,not_removed,i had it on my nexus its was quite stable in terms that i had no app crashes but there was a annoying lock screen bug im back on beta cause i wanted to keep the fingerprint gestures and avoid that bug
Android,not_removed,using it on my nexus since last days mostly it works fine but randomly freezes and i have to force reboot press power button for sec also im stuck at edge data even thought lte is enabled in setting im almost always connected to wifi but i would rather not be in a situation when im out n about and need data and not have it ill be flashing the n stable april factory images when they drop next monday
Android,not_removed,tried it and was a bit buggy especially with snapchat so i just went back to
Android,not_removed,i use kitkat as my daily driver
Android,not_removed,yeah but hows the battery
Android,not_removed,then why did you even bother to comment
Android,not_removed,i didnt have too many problems of lag or stutters but for me the battery would drain like crazy screen off battery drain would reach per hour and my phone would inexplicably begin to go thermonuclear did a couple factory resets but the issue would continue to happen ended up rolling back to because while i enjoyed the extra features like pushing the navbar buttons to one side i prefer having a battery last overnight and not burn a hole in my pocket

Android,not_removed,starting in version chrome began of nearby smart beacons
Android,not_removed,settings privacy physical web is where to look to toggle this on or off
Android,not_removed,i made a post about this a few months ago and even back then the mods removed it for being old news
Android,not_removed,before reading about smart beacons i though you walked past a server park or something web pages nearby doesnt tell much
Android,not_removed,chrome seems to support smart beacons i saw a notification at a trade show last month
Android,not_removed,i also got one at the same time as this
Android,not_removed,i saw while leaving the stadium after a blue jays game i didnt go to the page because it looked like the fucking sketchiest thing ever
Android,not_removed,oh boy advertisement fest is just around the corner
Android,not_removed,this is how google tested spaces in they had beacons in every session with the url for its space
Android,not_removed,this happend to me earlier it was kind of weird
Android,not_removed,im not sure if this is a thing or not but this is what i first thought the title meant geotags searched items that way when youre near said area it reminds you i personally thought that would be awesome add a blacklisted word to hide anything of the sort sorry im rambling
Android,not_removed,not exactly new probably just the first time youve ever come across one
Android,not_removed,this is for coupons and the like costco has this in canada
Android,not_removed,well if your neighbors want to share porn with you you should let them
Android,not_removed,no beacons in vancouver yet
Android,not_removed,what does it mean by nearby webpages the internet isnt a physical object
Android,not_removed,this isnt new
Android,not_removed,do you want cpu wakelocks because this is how you get them
Android,not_removed,i just googled what a smart beacon was and do not like it do you chrome for mobile users have any way of turning the notifications off
Android,not_removed,there was a beacon at a restaurant the other day but all the beacon did was tell me about this new feature i was confused who put the beacon there
Android,not_removed,sounds like a security risk what if the smart beacon is malicious
Android,not_removed,the option was already off for me is this an optin feature because i dont remember turning it off
Android,not_removed,the moderation of this sub was atrocious its better now but still not excellent
Android,not_removed,smart beacon got a good source to read up on them when i googled it i mainly saw results for bluetooth ones though calling this a website nearby would to me imply that it goes through www
Android,not_removed,its been there for a while op just didnt know bigbrotheriswatching﻿ lol
Android,not_removed,i saw this a while ago in stable too
Android,not_removed,waiting patiently for ublock beacons
Android,not_removed,its a series of tubes
Android,not_removed,if you have your bt enabled and scanning anyways this is just in the air
Android,not_removed,chrome settings privacy and there should be a toggle for physical web
Android,not_removed,the nearbyphysical websites feature by default is off however beacon detection is always on if you have bt enabled btw whats your problem with beacons i mean okay in malls they can be just as annoying as courters i think this is the right word basically people who jump in front of you and try to get you to go to their employing store and shop but eg on an expo it can be quite helpful
Android,not_removed,turn off bluetooth
Android,not_removed,theres one of those somewhere in my office which makes sense because were a tech company working with that kind of thing i cannot for the life of me figure out where it is or why it isnt sending anything useful
Android,not_removed,the received broadcasts are ran through a proxy service which would be able to filter out spammalicious results amongst other things
Android,not_removed,im a security researcher and have been looking at beacons ill say they did a pretty good job making them as safe as possible
Android,not_removed,you shouldnt be getting downvoted its a legitimate question i dont know how security has changed since this article was written but its not like there was never any problem with security
Android,not_removed,what using that logic you shouldnt even be in here what if a subreddit is malicious or a webpage
Android,not_removed,dont touch it then
Android,not_removed,believe its off by default
Android,not_removed,notifications for it are off by default you cant disable beacon scanning likely because google wants to datamine their locations
Android,not_removed,i like the modding here its the only sub where theyre mostly invisible and arent letting their power go to their head
Android,not_removed,physicalweborg
Android,not_removed,fair point malls blowing up my notification feed was my first thought
Android,not_removed,on a freshly installed nexus device without ever opening chrome i got those notifications so it seems to be in by default
Android,not_removed,okay so this is what bt scanning in location settings menu is for
Android,not_removed,if you work with that kind of thing it might be someone trying to set one up or messing with one and just havent put the information into it
Android,not_removed,same our office on the other side of the building has one that popped up in the last week everytime i go over there i get a notification about it i think its the company above ussince they do mobile development i almost want to shoot them an email to fix it
Android,not_removed,im a techie and i keep knee on my pocket you can get a direction finding app to find it if you really want
Android,not_removed,eehh i mean if your phone suggest that beaconwebsite people will click on it without knowing what it is if i go to a website im usually aware of what it is
Android,not_removed,would you click on a random link you get in an sms
Android,not_removed,its always only one notification also the information is hopefully going to be relevantish since physical proximity is needed however here in berlin a beacon company has already started advertising themselves using beacons in public transit which isnt relevant whatsoever so yeah
Android,not_removed,you dont get a noise alert it simply shows when you go into your notification list further these beacons are lowpowered so their range is limited i dont think stores are going to be that into this technology amusement parks museums et all those will be the places i look to really using this technology heavily stores may see some benefit but it wont really provide much value to customers
Android,not_removed,so turn off bluetooth when you arent using it why would you need to be constantly walking around with bluetooth enabled
Android,not_removed,i suppose
Android,not_removed,its been months someone probably got it to play with and forgot about it
Android,not_removed,also in order to use the beacon you have to turn bluetooth on which is a security risk in itself standing near a beacon and watching for people on their phone would be a good way to know who had bt on and who doesnt
Android,not_removed,their problem
Android,not_removed,no of course not i wouldnt blindly enter a smart beacon site either i was just pointing out that a smart beacon isnt any less safe or unsafe than any webpage online
Android,not_removed,i also live in berlin and noticed this on the a couple of times
Android,not_removed,the amusement park i frequent cedar point already has a similar feature built into their app it notifies you when you arive of any events and when you leave it tells you to have a nice day
Android,not_removed,why would you need to be constantly walking around with bluetooth enabled smartwatch
Android,not_removed,its convenient for it to be on all the time for smart unlock with my activity tracker and automatically connecting to my car radio without fiddling
Android,not_removed,because i dont wanna
Android,not_removed,sennheiser momentum fitbit charge hr
Android,not_removed,very helpful now go jump off a bridge
Android,not_removed,now imagine them taking that a step further with beacons say when you get in line for a ride you get a notification showing how long the estimated wait time is or maybe they give you a link to a page showing the history of the ride or how it was made to give you some relevant entertainment while you wait
Android,not_removed,woah did cedar point update their app it used to be just like their mobile website wrapped in an app
Android,not_removed,ah yeah i forgot people actually used these things
Android,not_removed,when you view the park map you can tap on a ride to view the wait time this is better than beacons because you can see the wait for a ride on the other side of the park before you walk over there dont get me wrong i think beacons are a cool concept and have a lot of applications
Android,not_removed,yeah just before this season it got a major upgrade
Android,not_removed,i dont own one myself but they seem like theyd be really handy
Android,not_removed,beacons can supplement that functionality that is their exact purpose is to supplement an experience not be the experience that experience can be benefited by having a good application web or native plus beacons all working together and pulling from the same data source
Android,not_removed,more wristy than anything
Android,not_removed,so many goodies given by oneplus to the reviewers huh
Android,not_removed,the review was hurried up i wanted to see more of the extras tbh
Android,not_removed,i kind of wish they came with headphones at least but oh well
Android,not_removed,its not a review it literally says full review coming soon seconds in the video
Android,not_removed,if youre looking for good iems i hear good thing about the kz zsts at gearbest right now personally not a fan of the inears though
Android,not_removed,he still couldve at least put the case on i cant decide which case to get
Android,not_removed,im sure he wont review the extras thats what i was looking forwards to hell just review the phone he should have spoken more about the cool extras
Android,not_removed,nah i cant use inears either right now im using some phillips sports earbuds i like them because the cable is tug resistant and they are really durable i always break my earbuds from pulling on them to hard
Android,not_removed,im pretty sure he said hed talk about the extras too in the full review
Android,not_removed,how are you sure he told you
Android,not_removed,the jvc earbuds i bought at walgreens are surprisingly good i cant use iem headphones either feels extremely awkward and uncomfortable to me

Android,not_removed,material shmaterial they do have an ugly photo tho
Android,not_removed,i like their logo and who has a material logo anyway
Android,not_removed,your dad is a giant guessing he uses earphones or does he hold it up to his face
Android,not_removed,where about hoping its coming to the uk soon
Android,not_removed,thats not too bad so nonlte maybe look at €
Android,not_removed,well huaweis is gradient but htc and samsung use materialesh one when you launch your phone
Android,not_removed,earphones of course although holding it to your face would also work just looks very ridiculous if you mind other people

Android,not_removed,their android tvs have really nice chipsets and lots of storage so will be very impressive from a smart tv standpoint sony better step up
Android,not_removed,this is pretty cool hopefully that means i can walk in a best buytarget and purchase one if its just online id rather buy it on lemall shipping is ridiculously fast from what ive heard they apparently use newegg warehouses
Android,not_removed,interesting now i need to learn more about them so i can tell guest more about them
Android,not_removed,i think the important part is that there will be a physical location you can return or exchange the phone at in case you have problems thats been the main issue for these cheap chinese phonesthat youre screwed as far as support goes if you get a dud
Android,not_removed,can you cast your screen from a nexus to the screen
Android,not_removed,does this mean i could finally buy a phone with qualcomms senseid with us carrier bands that isnt from an online chinese shenzen clearinghouse oh boy
Android,not_removed,compared to xiaomi mi box how are they
Android,not_removed,smart tvs are a joke if you own an nvidia shield though buying a new tv every other year to upgrade the processor or software is a hillarious concept
Android,not_removed,for their phones at least yup ordered a at and it was waiting for me at home the next day i was shocked
Android,not_removed,target employee yes
Android,not_removed,in the us theyre allowing customers to do returns thru their online store their phones are coming from warehouses in the states
Android,not_removed,in my personal experience leeco has been exceptional in this area i bought a le for my brother and a le for my wife eventually we returned the le only because we wanted a better camera but loved everything else about the phone the return process was incredibly simple i went to their website found my order and submitted a return request within a few hours i got a prepaid shipping label i dropped it off the next day got back to them in about business days and my refund was received the very next day
Android,not_removed,yes you can i have it and it works awesomely
Android,not_removed,with chromecast yes
Android,not_removed,yes all android tv devices allow that
Android,not_removed,the le eco tv smokes the mi box much faster processing more ram better gpu and way more storage mi box and latest sony tvs are shitty cores the two primary cores on the le eco are cores these tvs have a gig more ram than the mi box as well
Android,not_removed,except most people dont need to upgrade every year but the geeky tech community no also most people dont buy nvidia shields btw the leeco has newer cortex processor cores than the nvidia shield
Android,not_removed,after their first flash sale i saw tons of people saying they got their phones within a single days at most still im glad i can buy them at more locations now
Android,not_removed,i ordered the google pixel close to a month before ordering the lepro got it the next day got the pixel weeks after that
Android,not_removed,he said guest so im going to assume yes
Android,not_removed,where did you get yours and for how much
Android,not_removed,so no cause with my sony android tv you dont need a chromecast and my other tv i use my nexus player to cast
Android,not_removed,will they get any support at all
Android,not_removed,i dont know anyone who upgrades their tv every other year this includes apple and google employees the leeco has newer cortex processor cores than the nvidia shield have a source on what that does in real world performance specs on leecos end are extremely vague no clockspeeds or even the system ram are listed because the has a maxwell gpu and cpu cores arm cortex arm cortex
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,on their website lemallcom got it during the flash sale off and got it for
Android,not_removed,do the sonys and the mi box at least google controls most of the updates with the playstore google play services leanback launcher and google cast app firmware with tvs is another story but in reality the tv firmware doesnt seem to be changing much
Android,not_removed,i didnt really mean they have to i was referring to the want you were hinting that people would have to and i was referring to the fact that no one cares about software and hardware upgrades every year except techies it really makes your complaint invalid for the general population having one of these tvs is not much different than buying a new samsung galaxy when it comes to software updates some people do use a phone more than a year or two if your tv is years old and you want a new operating system even though the playstore is still updating your apps you can certainly buy a streaming box then how is this tv hurting you when enjoying the smarts for the first years its not like you can buy a better tv for cheaper that doesnt have smarts the specs are right on their website including ram and clock speed real world tests arent out in the wild yet even though owners are starting to receive their tvs im not saying the new tvs will be more performant than the shield as we have seen the same cores in the sonys perform much worse than the ones in the mi box i literally just said the le ecos have newer cores which is considerably impressive considering the shit we got from xiaomi and sony cortex® at cpu multicore mali™ gpu flash storage ram i really dont understand your reasoning for the hate

Android,not_removed,what exactly is high res mode on poweramp havent used the app in quite a while
Android,not_removed,how can you tell when it has been proven in doubleblind tests that humans cannot tell between audio and highres youre either suffering from the placebo effect or the setting does somethimg unexpected to the hardware and affects playback in other ways
Android,not_removed,could you link to the said apk im getting confused which one edit
Android,not_removed,doesnt music have a limited dynamic range of around i think the has a dynamic range slightly less than that so not sure how audio will make a difference on it htc has a dynamic range of so at least on that device i can understand the use of audio i havent studied audio in years so someone correct me if im wrong
Android,not_removed,what does this do enhance the audio quality on the and how does it do it
Android,not_removed,well mine failed it shows the option of high res audio but it failed to use it running n miui also tried on custom roms and had to revert to opengl one any way to report this to the dev
Android,not_removed,practically speaking with our audio recorder app you can hear the difference in recording even on a cheap android device without the dac support on marshmallow devices our app can record wav floating point at some android devices natively support and or other devices will interpolate so arent really adding any new info any android phone above marshmallow will support and with our app just that some phones will support it natively in the hardware also however in our testing with a cheap android phone the difference in quality is clearly audible when listening on speakers between wav hz wav while our audio recorder app can play wav floating point at files the only third party app i could find that plays wav is httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomneutroncodempeval
Android,not_removed,i wish poweramp would add support for android auto
Android,not_removed,poweramp is a placebo every week i see posts from people praising it
Android,not_removed,instead of the default output of poweramp on supported devices like the htc and lg you can make poweramp process the audio at or bit and output it up to khz its fairly recent so if you havent used it in a while it should be new to you
Android,not_removed,even more placebo snake oil than the usual bitperfect output mode
Android,not_removed,you should have been here when people were raving about the adapt sound setting in the galaxies they were talking about it like it was magic its just another eq for me it just made all frequencies slightly louder i dont understand those people but then again im not an audiophile
Android,not_removed,as an audio engineer here yes you can maybe your usual user that listens to music on cheap in ears cannot but the difference in quality is very obvious from to for example bass is deeper highs are more airy the sensation of depth is bigger you just need propper equipment and i dont mean expensive to perceive this as for bit x bit the difference is more for the app itself how it processes whatever dsp magic it is doing being it eq compression whatever edit the difference is also probably bigger when working with the audio itself after being downsampled dithered and all the stuff we do before it gets to the consumers ears the difference may be more subtle but like how i said for the average joe that listen to music on the gym at the library while studying or on the bus on the way home itll probably not be noticed
Android,not_removed,the fact that its been proven on average doesnt mean that no single individual has the ability to discern the sound quality i dont you probably dont but there are outliers in every population even when the stats say that the acceptable answer is that we cant discern there is the possibility for individuals who can discern to exists
Android,not_removed,i am fairly certain they mean alpha httpwwwapkmirrorcomspowerampposttypeappreleasesearchtypeapk
Android,not_removed,yes thats the version in marshmallow you can try the which is alpha
Android,not_removed,this works as far i understand using the dedicated dac of the phone to get as said before bits audio which in my non expert opinion makes the music sound better
Android,not_removed,here you can
Android,not_removed,if someone puts all settings in poweramp to their default values the exact same ones as the outofthebox players and then say it sounds different then id agree with you but using the plethora of audio tweaking and adjustment options no other player has poweramp really does make a difference not all mastering is done well not all music players are done well my cars audio setup for instance is terrible i have to deal with it using my own means and no placebo can provide this yes the difference between poweramp and the default players is that big but not because poweramp does anything vastly different its because it just provides the option of a suit done for you by your tailor instead of the one size fits all mindset
Android,not_removed,fyi increasing the sample rate wont improve sound quality
Android,not_removed,this also works for the exynos model
Android,not_removed,awesome thanks for the heads up
Android,not_removed,should work on most snapdragon phones as they tend to have the aqstic codec
Android,not_removed,thats because you dont understand how it works its not just an equaliser it tests each ear for sensitivity in all different frequencies and boosts the frequencies that you have trouble hearing on each ear individually its especially noticeable if you have one ear thats worse than the other i definitely noticed increased clarity and started to notice small things in songs that i hadnt noticed before its not some crazy amazing technology but it does have a useful application other than simply being an equaliser
Android,not_removed,the adapt sound setting does make everything sound better and more loud definitely not just a placebo you have a different effect from it based on what you say you hear and dont hear
Android,not_removed,all frequencies yeah itll do this if youre pretty much deaf that is if you pressed no for everything
Android,not_removed,thats simply not true and youre either not an audio engineer or are one with no understanding of digital signals look up the nyquist theorem
Android,not_removed,no thats complete rubbish youre just regurgitating what youve read elsewhere on reddit or headfi what youve read about it how do you know bass is deeper its clearly not below because you cant hear that is perfectly achievable by khz recording or those airy highs that means nothing maybe what youre trying to say is that its more prevalent thats nothing to do with bitrate that just means its mixed differently please dont spread misinformation
Android,not_removed,yes you can please post your abx logs and testfiles audio engineer here your credentials dont really matter
Android,not_removed,random ten year old article calling an aes paper a random ten year old article shows your biases
Android,not_removed,people that claim to be superhuman should reliably be able to pass an abx and provide proof of their claims until then
Android,not_removed,yep thats the one that got it working for me too
Android,not_removed,have an upvote for correct usage of punctuation
Android,not_removed,of course but some of us have highres tracks
Android,not_removed,damn as someone whos slowly going deaf and has much less hearing in my right ear id love this
Android,not_removed,it actually does this when you answer yes to all the beeps
Android,not_removed,well if youre going for the fact that according to the theorem you only need a sampling rate of to fully represent sound for humans then that is a bit incorrect wrt songs according to fourier theory a time limited signal which all songs are is composed of infinite frequencies in the frequency domain and its dual is also true so a song actually contains an infinite number of frequencies and a higher sampling rate is actually helpful for songs how much difference it will make is up for debate i personally cannot hear the difference between a flac file and a sampled sound
Android,not_removed,what is not true hehe i wouldnt say shit on the internet for the sole purpose of saying it and you what are you
Android,not_removed,nope neither reddit or other shitty site wtf is headfi i actually work with it for over years how do you know bass is deeper listen to it deeper fuller whatever you may want to call it and it isnt about bandwidth it is abouth perceived depth
Android,not_removed,what are your credentials
Android,not_removed,well i cant give you credentials and they mean shit but i have my ears and been working on this field for over ten years if you cant notice a difference its up to you but other people sure can and of that want important you would have improved specifications allowing for up to audio on blue ray neither youd have hardware manufacturers trying to improve the accuracy of dacs and adcs each and every year do a research and look for anyone that works on bit audio i am sure youll have a hard time finding anybody and btw the main reason is still used is probably related to the red book cd standard or something like that i think that audio was never adopted to dvd either because of the high demands of video regarding to video like i said the difference can be subtle or great depending on your ears and gear
Android,not_removed,training doesnt matter okay bud lol
Android,not_removed,theres also this httpsxiphorgxiphmontdemoneilyounghtml
Android,not_removed,randi has said that few unsuccessful applicants ever seriously consider that their failure to perform might be due to the nonexistence of the power they believe they possess from the httpsenwikipediaorgwikionemilliondollarparanormalchallenge its overwhelmingly likely that anyone who believes in themselves more than science will continue to believe in themselves and not science
Android,not_removed,but your ears dont have the extra range every frequency your ears can possibly hear can be reproduced with a sample rate of i record raw tracks at and playing them back before and after downsampling them results in zero audible difference
Android,not_removed,that our ears couldnt hear the difference in any case you definitely cant
Android,not_removed,oops i guess its yes also what
Android,not_removed,helpful for songs what does this mean if the song is for humans to listen to then all of the infinite frequencies outside the range of our hearing wont be heard anyway theyll just make some speakers work harder for no reason i can totally understand wanting to keep an archive of lossless music even if the difference between kbps and lossless is completely placebo some people like keeping their library like an archive and its great for transcoding later if necessary but keeping information thats outside the range of our hearing will never enhance anyones listening experience
Android,not_removed,it has been proven with both math and double blind testing over decades nobody can tell apart sample rate from anything above it your ears just dont have the capability to tell the difference
Android,not_removed,youre just saying random buzzwords now deeper fuller how can that supposedly be it doesnt just magically appear with a bit recording whatever you play it back through
Android,not_removed,he can paint using his poop
Android,not_removed,bachelor in electrical engineering and digital audio enthusiast
Android,not_removed,you would have improved specifications allowing for up to audio on blue ray marketing youd have hardware manufacturers trying to improve the accuracy of dacs and adcs each and every year generally the dac itself is perfected oversampling dacs have been transparent ever since the the audio cd era in many implementations its the analog stage that suffers and thats more due to financial or boardspace constraints not lack of expertise and btw the main reason is still used is probably related to the red book cd standard or something like that i think that audio was never adopted to dvd either because of the high demands of video regarding to video the worldlength is due to the fact that computer worldlengths are in multiple of like i said the difference can be subtle or great depending on your ears and gear itd be nice if you could submit proof of the actual audibility of highresution audio no doubt the aes would shower you with grant money and pay for you to lecture around the word
Android,not_removed,when someone makes a claim contrary to scientific consensus evidence is needed
Android,not_removed,its a paper in a scientific journal its not an article
Android,not_removed,especially out of most cellphone dacs people will think youre nitpicking and i can see both sides peace of mind but from a purely factual perspective it is completely correct and personally as someone who prefers to store my library locally its nice to know the arms race for audio is long over and as my library grows i dont have to worry about increasing the file sizes since micro sd cards are still relatively small all things considered
Android,not_removed,for most it is simply about peace of mind and many if not all audiophiles acknowledge this doesnt take away the fun of collecting as much high res music as possible though
Android,not_removed,does processing them eq reverb etc at high sample rate sound different
Android,not_removed,its mostly because the theoretical results cannot be achieved ideally the perfect waveforms which are used in the mathematical construction are not present in the real world oversampling is a very common technique for increasing the fidelity of the real world signal it is commonly used to prevent antialiasing as a square filter is impossible to achieve and higher order filters needed for a sharp cutoff are expensive to construct anyway you are probably right that no one can probably tell the difference anyway and the only reason is for archival purposes my point was that sampling at a higher rate does change the reconstructed frequencies in the audible range aliasing and phase distortion due to filter linear phase response is also hard to achieve whether those differences can be noticed is another story
Android,not_removed,buzzwords lol it can be a buzzword if by that you mean as how audio workers describe sound characteristics youre right it doesnt magically appear but if done from the ground up not up sampled bla bla bla if you can point me to any studio in the world that records ill shut my mouth
Android,not_removed,no hearing and feeling are different with low frequency you feel as much or more than you hear so with a proper system you should feel deeper bass with higher fidelity it comes down to what system you are listening on on headphones you may not notice but a full quality home or studio system you will notice you can have subwoofer that deliver bass down to the signal digits and you feel it i also have been an audio engineer for years as my primary profession
Android,not_removed,enthusiast is not a credential
Android,not_removed,marketing nope it does sound better not on your average joes av system the worth of doing this is debatable tho generally the dac itself is perfected oversampling dacs have been transparent ever since the the audio cd era in many implementations its the analog stage that suffers and thats more due to financial or boardspace constraints not lack of expertise as long as it is in the signal path for me it can be improved specially prosumer gear although your point about optimizing the analog signal is true the worldlength is due to the fact that computer worldlengths are in multiple of i am not stupid and know that you should look out for the red book cd specs also itd be nice if you could submit proof of the actual audibility of highresution audio no doubt the aes would shower you with grant money and pay for you to lecture around the word again proof for what i hear it i have better ears than most people i know and like i said it also depends on the hardware the listener uses i have done work in for example and certainly there is a difference i just dont use this sample rate on a daily basis because in the end it is not worth maybe not really a difference but more like some nuances and details again some dude on a cell phone wont listen with the same nuances and details as much expensive equipment and real world use is very different from lab testing
Android,not_removed,not the most scientific test but this shows a signal being fully reconstructed using a consumergrade dac even after it should have been altered for the worse
Android,not_removed,the lowest frequencies in the audible spectrum are the most easy to reproduce for a digital system due to their low bandwidth its the same with lossy encoders bass is not affected at all even on low bitrates mid and high frequences depending on encoder lowpass also and transients
Android,not_removed,neither audio engineer is you cant appeal to authority to support a claim actual proof is needed
Android,not_removed,i am not stupid and know that you should look out for the red book cd specs also i know what the red book standard is again proof for what i hear it i have better ears than most people i know and like i said oh well now i know not take you seriously in case you do believe you can trust sighted testing google about audio placebo and the mcgurk effect perception of sound is really imprecise and the mind as well as other sensory information affects it greatly real world use is very different from lab testing i dont know what you mean about lab testing but technology has surpassed the limitations of human hearing a long time ago
Android,not_removed,youre genuinely a unicorn if you actually can tell apart sample rate from anything above it because so far nobody else has ever been able to prove to be able to do that in a double blind test youd literally be the first edit just look here httpsxiphorgxiphmontdemoneilyounghtml
Android,not_removed,perception doesnt matter if the math and physics says youre wrong because then its purely psychological not a genuine difference in quality placebo and all that come back when you passed a double blind test
Android,not_removed,the weather feels cold today global warming does not exist
Android,not_removed,i am downloading something at the moment so buffering is slow but i want to say that getting an identical signal after passing a waveform through an adc and dac is impossible because some information is always lost in the process of digitisation yes the reconstruction can be good enough that no one can tell but the difference is still there i do agree with you that the difference is not noticeable to most people my point was oversampling does have its benefits which do have an effect on the audible frequency spectrum yes those differences are not noticeable by the majority of the people but nyquist criterion is not an argument against oversampling while dealing with timelimited signals
Android,not_removed,ok then i am and other fellow aes an unicorn
Android,not_removed,if you really believe youre right theres money to be made in being the first person to ever pass a rigorous double blind test on this just fyi
Android,not_removed,httpsxiphorgxiphmontdemoneilyounghtml theres a million free resources proving it is impossible try a double blind test i guarantee you cant pass it you can even do it yourself on a computer it doesnt matter that you think you hear a difference if can be nothing but placebo because you know if it is active or not and you need more than your perception to prove it
Android,not_removed,a better headphone output with an amplification circuit that produces less distortion and that has better frequency response will obviously drive headphones better a dac digitaltoanalog converter with worldlength and sampling rate greater than bit will not
Android,not_removed,fly here and ill show it to ya we can work a full song from the ground up and youll understand what i mean
Android,not_removed,httpsxiphorgxiphmontdemoneilyounghtml
Android,not_removed,httpsxiphorgxiphmontdemoneilyounghtml as i said youre invited to fly here and we can do a track together edit i agree that music makes no sense and btw did you see he up sampled the clip to
Android,not_removed,he also mentions vs bit and shows why is the limit for every human ever tested so far
Android,not_removed,yes i am reading but he makes some weird assumptions like none of that is relevant to playback here bit audio is as useless as sampling the good news is that at least bit depth doesnt harm fidelity it just doesnt help and also wastes space dynamic range for one is much better on bit some newer daws even use and bit float to work internally the dsp software bla bla bla to improve fidelity and snr anyway just to develop my point further it is really different to work with higher sample ratesbit depth our fellow redditor complained about my use of buzzwords but things like deepness fullness depth described exactly what is perceived when working at highest resolutions and after reducing everything to and dithering it just sound flatter it sounds richer and that may in part benefit from the dsp doing its job more precisely this effect is also diminished when working with higher end equipment and this will be where maybe well agree on the analog path needing to be improved btw i also perceive differences when using encoded by myself ogg or flac are much harder to discern anyway that was an interesting read probably the most interesting thing ive done while crossing midnight
Android,not_removed,chances are the only thing youre hearing is encoding artifacts just as mentioned in the article that is if youre genuinely hearing a difference
Android,not_removed,its amazing
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,tim schofield and erica griffin always have such solid detailed reviews i personally trust them more than pretty much anyone else on youtube
Android,not_removed,tim longtime subscriber and fan question are you planning on upgrading your lighting situation it always seems a bit dark in your videos which might deter new viewership particularly since most people judge books by their cover just a thought
Android,not_removed,that was actually a pretty good review
Android,not_removed,so tldw
Android,not_removed,samsung vs google question edge and have same battery but edge lasts so much longer can you only optimize battery life if you are the manufacturer why cant google do this
Android,not_removed,off topic but i like that brooks brothers shirt
Android,not_removed,thank you appreciate that
Android,not_removed,yes there is nothing wrong with the replacement devices i dont think they go back on sale to the general public until late october though i highly recommend this phone
Android,not_removed,i got one from verizon a few days ago in ny
Android,not_removed,i watch erica to tell me pointless info about color gamut but i watch floss when i want to hear how the phone will actually affect my life
Android,not_removed,mobiletechreview as well
Android,not_removed,i am actually just bought a new camera so that will help lighting kit upgrade is next
Android,not_removed,really hard to say because we dont know how samsung will handle the million refurbs its kinda unprecedented you could see discounts on new devices along with deals on refurbs you could see buy get one refurb deals nobody knows probably not even samsung yet
Android,not_removed,awesome but shits spensive
Android,not_removed,part of it is the sd in the its a power sucker but i think not sure but think touchwiz has some optimizations for battery life someone correct me if i am wrong about that
Android,not_removed,fancy
Android,not_removed,an att rep i spoke to stated october
Android,not_removed,its not supposed to be available to the general public for another few weeks but carriers should have some reserved for replacements if you want to be a dirty bastard like me you can go see if a carrier will sell you one anyways thats what i did uzaxosk
Android,not_removed,the color gamut is actually one of the key reasons i like erica griffin practically no other reviewer talks about the display in as much detail as her
Android,not_removed,i watch floss when i want to know how a device is likely to affect my buns level
Android,not_removed,this is exactly right and then you watch mkbhd to drool over the sweet visuals of the actual device
Android,not_removed,yeah from zero to ten his reviews are a certified go
Android,not_removed,i trust floss more than any reviewer that ive seen so far dude doesnt hold back
Android,not_removed,on a scale of one to ten this is a major go
Android,not_removed,funny att gave me my replacement nonexplodey on sept
Android,not_removed,dont forget the floss factor
Android,not_removed,or my nerd herd status
Android,not_removed,on the low i watch mkbhd to mire his flawless skin and the high production quality of the video
Android,not_removed,major
Android,not_removed,all yall haters all yall trolls close ur eyesand picture me rollin 😎😎
Android,not_removed,its a win
Android,not_removed,yes im talking about to sell them to customers that never had it before theyre doing exchanges first
Android,not_removed,carriers have the note but they are supposed to be reserved for people who need to replace their recalled devices late october is when its supposed to open up for anyone
Android,not_removed,i personally just want to know if it feels good in the hands
Android,not_removed,he changes it up every time
Android,not_removed,and then i do
Android,not_removed,i first watched watched him after going a couple months without seeing his videos it used to be all yall haters all yall trolls eat a dck 😂😂
Android,not_removed,ahhhh i didnt realize they werent selling them to the general public yet thanks for the correction
Android,not_removed,yeah i was actually looking to buy one but i havent found a retailer thats selling them yet
Android,not_removed,if you can wait until you can find it somewhere i think you will be impressed its the best phone ive ever owned
Android,not_removed,i had a galaxy and i hated it i switched to nexus which is good but it just doesnt seem like a full featured phone my friend recently got a note and i got an for work and ive been really impressed by them i think im going to go for the note for my personal phone
Android,not_removed,i would highly recommend it you cant even recognize that the and note came from the same company the improvements samsung has made in that short time is unbelievable
Android,not_removed,praise harambe
Android,not_removed,it sounds like we may see this new product in the previously rumored nexus google watches it makes sense a wearable is less likely to suffer a drop but is much more likely to come into contact with things that want to scratch the face of the display im very much looking forward to seeing the performance of this glass hopefully in a google watch
Android,not_removed,nice whatever that preview watch is looks ugly af though it seems like there are barely any smart watches that are built to be really tough id kill for an android wear that boasts really good durability and waterproofing to me a watch is more of a buy it for life type thing id want something super durable with a long lasting battery dont really care much for software as long as it can display a clock and have music controls thats all i really care about
Android,not_removed,dicksout
Android,not_removed,its been out longer than it should have
Android,not_removed,to clarify you should never use an alwaysnever dialog for sharing
Android,not_removed,seems like they are rebranding everything to be google something its good rebranding it
Android,not_removed,they should rename the admin dashboard as the g spot
Android,not_removed,because clearly no one here understands the etymology of the name httpwwwinvestopediacomtermsccsuiteasp
Android,not_removed,rebranded for gmail users first then a year later google apps will be rebranded for google apps users
Android,not_removed,g suite sounds lewd as fuck
Android,not_removed,aint nuthin but a g suite baby
Android,not_removed,are there any other changes at side from the name cant check the article at the moment
Android,not_removed,i expect they thought about it a lot they had to do something as explaining that google apps isnt actually an just a phone app was tiresome i would guess they would loved to have called it g office as in ms office or even g but g suite is a good compromise as g google and suite a very broad range of things
Android,not_removed,google should stop renaming shit just for the sake of changes
Android,not_removed,g suit fly on the wall for the rebranding meetings
Android,not_removed,for those english learners sound of suite is similar to sweet not shot
Android,not_removed,something new from google i assume this wont be available to apps users oh wait
Android,not_removed,also dropping support for grandfathered free google apps users you have to upgrade within days
Android,not_removed,next theyll rename the home button the g spot so any tutorials will include the step hit the g spot
Android,not_removed,fits with the whole alphabet inc thing too
Android,not_removed,g spot
Android,not_removed,needed to be done i feel
Android,not_removed,cant wait for g message s
Android,not_removed,it makes sense until they ignore it
Android,not_removed,i guess the pixels will probably come out as gphones
Android,not_removed,gixel
Android,not_removed,so we can expect g store g music g books etc
Android,not_removed,theyre retroactively gifying everything they ownyet they then release two new apps that have no google identification whatsoeverallo and duo
Android,not_removed,letters
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i spreadsheets in my g suite
Android,not_removed,ive never heard this in my life
Android,not_removed,introducing a new way to stack them chips g unit
Android,not_removed,fucking dumb as hell google suite fine g suite im not ever saying that to any business professional ever certainly not to a c level executive and not to anyone i know
Android,not_removed,not yet
Android,not_removed,to be fair as a sysadmincto at a small company that uses apps for workthe name google apps is pretty ambiguous and confusing to many people g suite makes sense especially to the suits or people who think they should be suits
Android,not_removed,i should introduce you to microsoft
Android,not_removed,shouldve named it gspot
Android,not_removed,this page indicates they are keeping the grandfathered free service do you have a link where they say they arent
Android,not_removed,is this confirmed if so i need an exit strategy
Android,not_removed,where did you see that ive not seen that in the info they just sent
Android,not_removed,pretty sure that would have been in the email they sent out to admins it was not
Android,not_removed,i cant find a source for this can you provide one
Android,not_removed,this is a big one there must be loads of these rightfully smug people who were quick to get onboard and have saved hundreds of dollars by doing so
Android,not_removed,wait what why would i pay for that when i dont even get everything that a person with a gmail account gets
Android,not_removed,g spothotspot
Android,not_removed,they dont ignore enterprise solutions its an actual moneymaker for them
Android,not_removed,theyre retroactively gifying everything but they released allo and duowith no google branding whatsoever
Android,not_removed,gphone
Android,not_removed,oh god is this going to be the new gif vs jif
Android,not_removed,if you check their play store listings they are prefixed with google httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappsfireball httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappstachyon
Android,not_removed,rmeirl
Android,not_removed,i wouldnt expect a layman to know but its a pretty common term if you work in the corporate world
Android,not_removed,do you run it for a thousandperson company powered by google didnt think so they have
Android,not_removed,it does sound pretty cheesy lol
Android,not_removed,this is the number one reason im so excited for this news searching for info will finally be helpful now can we get a subreddit
Android,not_removed,but why g suite why a singular letter instead of a full google name
Android,not_removed,suits love suites
Android,not_removed,this is a big one there must be loads of these rightfully smug people who were quick to get onboard and have saved hundreds of dollars by doing so i dont mind paying for my account its actually quite cheap the problem is that since it was free i gave an account to plenty of people if i start paying i have to pay for all of them and thats too expensive
Android,not_removed,agreed here if i cant use fi i am not paying for it
Android,not_removed,my girlfriend agrees
Android,not_removed,i mean branding and such not the products they are pretty solid
Android,not_removed,theyre called google allo and google duo on the store and the assistant is fairly obviously google within allo if youre familiar with their design never mind the fact its called google assistant youre still right that once theyre installed theres virtually no branding but personally i think thats how it should be within most apps anyway
Android,not_removed,google phone would make sense so would googleos
Android,not_removed,its jif
Android,not_removed,me too thanks
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrgsuites
Android,not_removed,same reason theyre replacing the full wordmark google with the g almost everywhere id imagine
Android,not_removed,you must not have unlimited data
Android,not_removed,i think theyve done a pretty decent job with their rebranding movement over the past twelve months
Android,not_removed,glados
Android,not_removed,i clean my house with jif my dog days yiff dank memes are gif
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,which is a bad decision because a single letter isnt as identifyable as a company name or an actual logo
Android,not_removed,googleos
Android,not_removed,you should know this but the creator of the gif image format steve wilhite of compuserve when deciding on the pronunciation said he deliberately chose to echo the american peanut butter brand jif and compuserve employees would often say choosy developers choose gifjif the oxford english dictionary accepts both pronunciations they are wrong it is a soft g pronounced jif end of story so if you want to look like you know anything about computers and their history at all pronounce it jif or you can come across like a year old doesnt care about honoring the creator and who dont know nothing
Android,not_removed,definitely agree butat least in a move atypical for googtheyre being consistent about it
Android,not_removed,it is if they customdesigned their wordmark thats not typeset in any font the letterforms were custommade so theyd be unique thats probably part of the reason behind the change from the old logo looking back the old logo was just set in an offtheshelf typeface so you might see it pop up elsewhere the new wordmark and g logos though those are completely unique to google between that and the coloration of the g i think they have a fairly recognizable logo thats starting to take hold
Android,not_removed,gos
Android,not_removed,or you can understand that language changes with timeuseage words change with timeuseage meanings change get what i mean if the majority of everyone who has ever used the word says it with a hard g then tough luck i am making up this bit for effect i have no way of knowing how many people use which sounding
Android,not_removed,so if you want to look like you know anything about computers and their history at all pronounce it jif heh thats some g level bait right there
Android,not_removed,thats like sooo computers heres the thing though basically everyone aware of the word uses a hard g so sadly for you and everyone else with a conservative inclination towards language youve lost youre too old let go nobody listens to techno now lets go just give me the signal ill be there with a whole list of new insults more importantly though i initially wasnt making a statement i just made a stupid fucking rhyme for fun id say take a pill but theres no such thing as a chill pill
Android,not_removed,just because almost everyone says febyuary or nukular or expresso doesnt make those pronunciations right it just makes those people look like tools
Android,not_removed,just because almost everyone says febyuary or nukular or expresso doesnt make those pronunciations right true but in time it will if enough people keep doing it it just makes those people look like tools yes for now see above
Android,not_removed,regardless my has noticeably better fluidity than my were at the point where optimization beats brute force
Android,not_removed,op where did you get this data from on my based phone i am consistently getting sample run
Android,not_removed,interesting especially when i shelled out less than rs usd for my sd based le recently whereas the cheapest device would set me back by more than double that update btw i am consistently getting as my multi core score
Android,not_removed,is that why some newer android tablets use it figures
Android,not_removed,any numbers on the helio might be the fastest multicore chip tbh at this moment im more interested in battery life and memory performance the helio is already without any lag
Android,not_removed,how does the compare to the with
Android,not_removed,hey op here by the way i have apps running in the background so maybe with them cleared and on a reboot itll push more
Android,not_removed,oneplus httpiimgurcomzrhoitxpng
Android,not_removed,the numbers an all seem a bit low my with an an older processor gets multicore i have a feeling that if an was under ideal conditions it would get much better
Android,not_removed,no wonder kryo has worse ipc than
Android,not_removed,btw geekbench is available as a free download until sept
Android,not_removed,im getting much and on my axon op
Android,not_removed,just as a reference the in my ipad pro scored can anyone run the test on a pixel c as a comparison
Android,not_removed,x performance with check your numbers
Android,not_removed,what my exynos is faster than a i got in multicore
Android,not_removed,on an ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,just tested my nexus and its as fast as the nexus also the for some reason shows up as being considerably slower despite having the same chip for some reason
Android,not_removed,why is it that i can see something similar to what i did a month ago and why is it that ive seen a lot of excitement around the chips i mentioned in this month during my ban
Android,not_removed,apple makes the os soc and everything in between there is no way in hell qc samsung and others will ever be able to catch up in that level of optimization as for why is loosing to in multicore cuz its quad vs octa which actually based on how it scaled it shows the shit job they did with the chipthough to be fair the cores are arm design unlike the series chips which are in house designed cores
Android,not_removed,youre so full of shit with those numbers op
Android,not_removed,apple is probably gonna wipe the floor with everyone why does that matter apple doesnt sell socs
Android,not_removed,weird my got a much lower score on singlecore while back in geekbench its lowest score is it also took a much longer time to complete the test and it seems that they removed the battery test
Android,not_removed,haha all those people making fun of the xperia x kappa
Android,not_removed,also the is not a symmetric quad core the has kryo cores at and kryo cores at the lower clocked kryo cores also have smaller cache which also reduce performance the sort of has big kryo cores and little kryo cores while the has big cores and little cores
Android,not_removed,even the will get better multicore scores due to the
Android,not_removed,which phone would you recommend more if price wasnt an issue
Android,not_removed,i dont know where op got his data but theres already people commenting that their does much better mine is doing it scores notably better than op and better than
Android,not_removed,im getting with my redmi note sd so i dont think those stats are too far off considering that the is better it might also depend on your rom and apps you are running
Android,not_removed,samsung was the data i used yours seems super low phones with just a have done better than your device
Android,not_removed,there seems to be a range for devices using the ive seen devices get more i was using results from an from samsung
Android,not_removed,how is the phone camera any way to get cm on it bhai
Android,not_removed,im finding the zuk much cheaper than the
Android,not_removed,not really that honour goes to the kirin you might like the snapdragon its essentially a helio with a faster gpu
Android,not_removed,single core is the same multicore is about points lower i believe
Android,not_removed,on a
Android,not_removed,it has worse ipc than
Android,not_removed,this is the new geekbench not geekbench
Android,not_removed,yes kryo cores are a marketing line they are nothing special
Android,not_removed,the crushing other chips has nothing to do with os optimization even in a vacuum its vastly superior
Android,not_removed,the in house cores are a joke it losing in multicore because it has less cores is no excuse when android likes cores and the dual core also beats it
Android,not_removed,they are numbers from an pro
Android,not_removed,the has cores and cores
Android,not_removed,uses kryo is also nothing special it has lower ipc than does
Android,not_removed,they dont sell it but they do make their own socs
Android,not_removed,this is meant to be a better test from so things were changed which is why a lot of scores are lower
Android,not_removed,im getting the same on single core but multi core dropped to quiet weird
Android,not_removed,is meant to be a fix of the big changes in scores is them fixing what they should be
Android,not_removed,but it doesnt translate directly to better benchmark scores otherwise the tsmc would be higher than the tsmc btw tsmcs offers about higher performance than samsungs according to andrei frumusanu a former anandtech editers smaller doesnt neccessarily mean better performance
Android,not_removed,higher performance at least itheir socs had more power than their socs too bad it is all thermal s
Android,not_removed,seems to be about the same as cores wtf qc😥
Android,not_removed,the is close to as poor for power consumption as the
Android,not_removed,almost but not quite on my device
Android,not_removed,the does as its already on the smaller process
Android,not_removed,if youre down for custom roms the if you prioritize actual customer support and a good camera get the or edge
Android,not_removed,well my running sultans rom gets and but he under clocks to save battery and heat
Android,not_removed,ok i would earlier take these numbers with a pinch of salt will now take them with a bag of salt
Android,not_removed,i get a toaster saying high performance mode entered as soon as i start the geekbench app from what i can see its a system generated toaster os must be interfering with the test now if i compare the results of my phone with that of phpquestions assuming that the individual tests are done in order i see that towards the later half of tests all numbers on my phone are worse i suspect that might be thermal control kicking in
Android,not_removed,excellent value for money todays deal on flipkart makes it even better no cm as of now
Android,not_removed,yeah though where i live india is yet to be launched
Android,not_removed,already ordered a new chinese device with the snapdragon was only € with qhd quckcharge etc just has a bad battery life and i need lte band
Android,not_removed,youre right sorry i get on
Android,not_removed,i agree the is a great chip but vastly superior may be an overstatement especially with the in a vacuum quantifier we will never fully be able to measure an versus anything android in a vacuum because of the very nature of running these benchmarks relies on the system that its being run on those are variables that we cant negate udrluciferz has a point that apple can optimize better because of this i dont think it necessarily means that qcsamsunhisilicon kirin cant be pushed to produce better socs or that the is not a great chip and even possibly subjectively better but to say that its vastly superior in a vacuum is negating too many factors that we cant control unless we would see android on an iphone or apples chips in an android
Android,not_removed,superior in single threaded tasks
Android,not_removed,thats my point i dont think anyone cares about iphone specs its the new iphone faster than the older one people will buy it
Android,not_removed,it is a matter of consistency with deviations as high as it loses legitimacy as the standard benchmark
Android,not_removed,its because itight not actually be smaller intels process is much smaller than everyone elses
Android,not_removed,the has cores on a smaller process and is fast qc probably made it on as to not pillage the they artificially made the worse
Android,not_removed,its noticeably better but it has the benefit of minimal throttling under high load my would get very hot very quickly
Android,not_removed,geekbench with my
Android,not_removed,are you running geekbench or though
Android,not_removed,if you use an which is an but in a close manufacturing process to the you see scores over
Android,not_removed,and display
Android,not_removed,yes sultans cm is pretty heavily under clocked its great for battery but terrible for benchmarks
Android,not_removed,getting it
Android,not_removed,le max
Android,not_removed,this isnt true you can use a benchmark written in c and compile it as a native app as long as you dont make jni calls and dont run into weird gc issues the two results will be directly comparable
Android,not_removed,its multicore perforamnce is nothing to laugh at thats a dual core getting points more than the quadcore or the octocore
Android,not_removed,which coincidently is the single most important metric
Android,not_removed,i would like to see a dedicated chip maker at least match the performance of a nondedicated chip maker it matters because it means qc is behind the ball on chip design and if they cant catch up oems should start looking for socs elsewhere the stranglehold qc has on lte radios is killing any potential competition
Android,not_removed,well its relevant for people wanting more smartphone performance for their buck and who are able to jump ship
Android,not_removed,theyre pretty close
Android,not_removed,has the same ipc than exynos and smokes it in effiency and performance
Android,not_removed,true but the kryo cores have actually worse ipc than cores
Android,not_removed,doesnt have an
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,and water resistant along with waaay cooler build
Android,not_removed,please note that a leeco le uses an expensive ecosystem for their headphone usbc headphones it was designed to be sold at a loss so that people will opt into the eco system its their solution to receiving money while supporting a device for the long term i think its a cool system but i have too many expensive audio gears as it is aside from that it is the best phone for its price
Android,not_removed,yeah just couldnt resist € for a device with band and the latest flagship soc is a ridiculous deal really cant justify buying a device anymore except for the camera
Android,not_removed,theoretically thats true but thats not how most of these tests and averages are run
Android,not_removed,number of cores needed doesnt matter because die area is similar
Android,not_removed,i disagree specially for android
Android,not_removed,the stranglehold qc has on lte radios is killing any potential competition probably wont last long intel is getting into the game
Android,not_removed,relevant only to android guys who have so many options iphones perform fast regardless of how it looks on paper i dont think iphone users think about specs when they buy it
Android,not_removed,i dont think ive ever heard someone say apple gives more bang for their buck before
Android,not_removed,thats got to be the worst reason ive ever heard to switching platforms
Android,not_removed,thats what i mean the is basically an
Android,not_removed,build is subjective
Android,not_removed,how would you compare it with the
Android,not_removed,has it arrived or have you just ordered it
Android,not_removed,have you got a link on gearbest it costs € from china
Android,not_removed,spec works this way
Android,not_removed,scaling matters though and is superior on the with dont know if all cores or just the highperformance cores are used int eh the cores the sd only scales from to or thats an inefficiency of or if cores are being used apple on the other hand with two cores scales from to or thats an efficiency of im not an apple fan and really like my but you really have got to admit the is a wonder i dont see how pointing out die size matters the is incredibly power efficient doesnt throttle and has incredible performance
Android,not_removed,i did i had the money and wanted the fastest phone available so i bought an iphone i tend to prefer android but i dont hate ios its easy enough to just download all of the google apps i use and everything gets transferred pretty seamlessly
Android,not_removed,comparing the dreadful javascript performance of android phones with iphones is a real world example of this
Android,not_removed,yeah but curved display doh even if its not practical its still cool
Android,not_removed,hasnt arrived yet ordered friday on gearbest with germany express shipping and the package is already in london might even arrive this week i did a bit of google research and the phone is probably not perfect but i could buy two of them for one axon or
Android,not_removed,it was a deal last week try this code maybe its still working gbleecole
Android,not_removed,ive had this discussion several times on reddit and elsewhere there are a few constraints in cpu design one very important one is die area it impacts device size thermal design clock frequency and several other things apple took the same constraints and optimized for a single threaded or double threaded workload since that is what ios wants samsung took the same constraints and optimized for multi threaded workloads which is exactly what android demands the result obliterates everything in single core workloads has a respectable dual core score the exynos obliterates everything in multi core workloads and has a respectable single core score both are the result of different optimizations according to the needs of the os they run and they are the best that we can make right now given the constraints and the needs
Android,not_removed,iphones have always been fast because ios is built to run on that hardware from the ground up its not about what the paper says its about optimizations ios will always have that advantage over android
Android,not_removed,my ipad mini destoy my nexus in javascript benchmarks both with socs yet the real world loading times when browsing arent that different sometimes the ipad is faster sometimes the nexus is faster
Android,not_removed,nice i just dont like the no and average battery maybe soon a phone with will come out thats not the expensive active
Android,not_removed,it still works thanks but shipping is from china though
Android,not_removed,samsung took the same constraints and optimized for multi threaded workloads which is exactly what android demands you show a profound lack of understanding you dont go single thread or multithread optimized in cpu design single thread performance is always superior to multithread performance if you have to choose between core delivering or cores each delivering you always got with the one core why because one core can handle threads but cores cannot handle one thread android does not demand more cores not at all in fact theres not a single application or platform that would demand more cores more performance sure but depending on the app a sufficient answer to that is either more cores or more single thread performance or a hard more single thread performance there is not a single scenario in which a cpus single thread performance is less relevant than its multithread performance
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,yeah the battery got mixed reviews and the fingerprint sensor and software also dont seem to work that well for some people i dont know if ill keep it as someone in family needs a new phone anyway the vernee apollo light also looks like a really good deal with band been on sale for € a couple times already and the should be good enough
Android,not_removed,got here in days for germany they offer free shipment and somehow take care of customs for you
Android,not_removed,you show a profound lack of understanding ok you dont go single thread or multithread optimized in cpu design you do single thread performance is always superior to multithread performance i dont get what youre saying here single thread performance is definitely inferior to multithread when doing things like background jobs or graphicheavy games if you have to choose between core delivering or cores each delivering you always got with the one core this is untrue because one core can handle threads but cores cannot handle one thread yes one core can handle threads or even two processes but there are significant penalties even stuff like hyperthreading is slower than cores running threads thats why we need more cores android does not demand more cores it absolutely does android is not much different from any modern linux distro the os expects and encourages use of multiple threads and runs several processes at once regardless of importance of the process try running ubuntu or windows on a single core cpu even one clocked at and discover suffering modern oses certainly demand more cores ios has taken a different route where it prioritizes one process over all others background jobs are minimal and highly restricted that has worked well for them till now in fact theres not a single application or platform that would demand more cores this is false many games run much better with multiple cores also dont forget that we are not talking about the needs of a single app we are talking about running processes simultaneously there is not a single scenario in which a cpus single thread performance is less relevant than its multithread performance again this is patently false please educate yourself a bit intel and amd are not idiots who have spent the last decade focusing on multicore performance todays oses demand more cores they run better consume less power do more things when the underlying architecture can support more processes and threads ios is an exception due to decisions taken by apple those decisions allow apple to focus on singledual core performance higher single core performance allows iphones to blaze through stuff like js benchmarks because js is notoriously singlethreaded android would positively suck on such a cpu it needs constant background tasks and it encourages modern multithreaded app development that mandates a cpu that has more cores
Android,not_removed,this is untrue it simply is not yes there is the overhead of a contextswitch but that really is negligible the added benefit of improved singlethread performance is always superior to that performancehit its only relevant when you have tens of thousands of threads which you dont in a consumeros yes one core can handle threads or even two processes but there are significant penalties again no theyre not significant it absolutely does android is not much different from any modern linux distro the os expects and encourages use of multiple threads and runs several processes at once regardless of importance of the process debian runs perfectly fine on my singlecore rpi you do not need multiple cores for any os try running ubuntu or windows on a single core cpu even one clocked at and discover suffering as i saidyoure spewing absolute bullshit if you want to test this go ahead take you quadcore pc underclock it to with cores and run some tests then do those same tests after disabling cores and clocking the cpu at as its the same cpu the total performance in terms of flops will be the exact same however youll have better performance with cores at a higher speed than with cores on ios has taken a different route where it prioritizes one process over all others as does android foreground jobs get high priority all background threads have a lower priority assigned by the scheduler also even if this were different this is no reason whatsoever for android to dislike single thread performance improving that would mean background tasks finish quicker improving performance everywhere again this is patently false please educate yourself a bit intel and amd are not idiots who have spent the last decade focusing on multicore performance i actually am educated literally as my masters degree in cs and software architecture would tell you that anyhow the reason multicore exists is because its more power efficient at a certain point the power needed to improve single thread performance scales in an approximately cubic scale meaning at a certain point you need the power to get the performance at that point its much more desirable to have double the cores count this gives you the performance but only in multithreaded scenarios at about the power consumption so get this multi core is only interesting for power efficiency not for performance reasons it is inferior in terms of performance ios is an exception due to decisions taken by apple it is not ios has a kernel with scheduling very similar to android it can handle multiple cores just fine as seen with the apple simply makes dual core cpus because their architecture is simply much superior to qualcomms qualcomm does not achieve the same single thread performance and cannot scale in a power efficient way so they went with more cores if you doubt this look at apples powwer consumption yes samsung beats them in multi threaded performance because samsung has cores but the battery in an iphone is almost half the size of the one in the while battery life is in the same ballpark
Android,not_removed,it simply is not it is again no theyre not significant they are debian runs perfectly fine on my singlecore rpi show me a recording of video at done on an rpi running debian then well talk fine is not what i want in my smartphone i want exceptional im not bothering to read after this because youre becoming uncivil if you want a discussion learn some manners and come back
Android,not_removed,you are ignoring every argument as someone having a similar degree to what ujustcallmeben has he is right in every point he lists
Android,not_removed,are you using a or have the oculus app
Android,not_removed,its from oculus its a new update glitch remove oculus or update it should fix
Android,not_removed,i have an edge plus i dont have this oculus app thats fucking up things should i have
Android,not_removed,creepy lol
Android,not_removed,that was it thanks

Android,not_removed,the nexus also had rave battery reviews at launch i wonder if the pixel will have more consistent battery life
Android,not_removed,someone in the sub was confused why i was excited with just around hr sot from hours the reason is same i had the too and coming from that most phones would be impressive wrt battery
Android,not_removed,my mom told me her pixel xl was about to die when she got home from work and she was upset i looked at it and it was at i went into battery stats to see what happened and found she had forgotten to charge it the night before so it had actually survived two days lol
Android,not_removed,i used to charge my htc times a day my pixel xl lasted sot with single charge im impressed
Android,not_removed,hnnngggf after switching from the with amazing battery to the which is both cumbersomely large and crappy battery im really very tempted to get the pixel xl or the sony xz such a tough descision edit holy shit the xl is more than twice the price of the xz in hong kong xz it is
Android,not_removed,i can sympathize with you as someone who uses an for work even using the phone pretty much only for calls its nearly dead by the end of the day however im very happy with my it replaced my opo for my personal phone and is the best stock battery experience ive had
Android,not_removed,a few screenshots wouldnt hurt
Android,not_removed,yeah i get around hours of screen on time along with remarkable standby
Android,not_removed,how to fix your long life there are always apps that will screw you over after a normal update my battery sipping pixel was caught last night after google play updated some apps i noticed that not only had the battery life dropped to hours but the top was getting warm i tried to identify what was eating power but it looked fairly normal i have had this many time before on earlier phones so restarted and everything is fine with about hours of predicted life
Android,not_removed,i drove uber on saturday night and forgot my cable so i couldnt charge in the car my pixel xl gave me six solid hours of screenon gpson driving before i went home with left
Android,not_removed,loving my new found freedom from the charger consistently getting hrs of sot over work days and getting close to hrs if im on it all day httpimgurcomafaruj
Android,not_removed,yesterday i had the phone off the charger for a little over hours had screen on time and plugged it in with to goi was impressed my never made it past screen on and id have to charge it after coming home from work both all stock and same apps
Android,not_removed,my had awful battery life my edge lasts me all day with heavy use
Android,not_removed,i am consistently getting hours of screen on time without trying i love it
Android,not_removed,pleasantly surprised by how good the battery life is on the regular pixel im at hours on of screen on usage and at percent not bad at all its not mind blowing like the moto z play but pretty decent by my standards
Android,not_removed,are the pixels running my battery life on my has more than doubled when i put the dev preview of on there no idea why but i end the day with more than battery now whereas i was struggling to make a full day frequently on nougat
Android,not_removed,a friend with an imported pixel xl is having stunning battery life its pretty awesome that said my recent edge purchase is also killing it in the battery department its a whole other planet compared to my previous htc one and edge
Android,not_removed,ive had my xl since friday and have yet to see less than battery remaining at the end of the day ive been very impressed so far
Android,not_removed,is it me or does doze only feel like it works properly on stock android devices
Android,not_removed,im just sitting over here with my and its hour sot
Android,not_removed,im gonna wait a few months
Android,not_removed,that moment when your zte sonata has me at sot than my i mean i do understand why and im going to miss not having to bring my charger to school and having incredible battery life when my rma device comes in
Android,not_removed,its also a brand new device of course that fresh battery is amazing ill wait a few months to get a better sense how good or bad it is
Android,not_removed,my does about that on a new battery but a lot lot worse on a older battery so i replace every months i guess replacing the battery on the pixl is a pain in butt otherwise id get one
Android,not_removed,on my redmi i get hours of screenontime
Android,not_removed,whats your sot my nexus struggles mightily to hit hours sot over a full day and i dont even use it for audio but standby time is still good enough that if i use it an hour or less itll last two days
Android,not_removed,just over sot with off the charger and still charge remaining would probably get another hour or so sot but im about to go to sleep so these screen captures will have to do moderate navigation usage today too xperia xz with stock rom httpiimgurcomzlclgumpng httpiimgurcomrqccsbfpng
Android,not_removed,this is the norm for most flagships nowadays the edge and iphone plus both get equivalent if not better battery life
Android,not_removed,sucks they lost the double front speakers like my has
Android,not_removed,itt buyers justifying their purchase
Android,not_removed,comparing it to the is dumb that phone has absolutely horrible battery life
Android,not_removed,lmao comparing a to the new pixel the battery was a joke
Android,not_removed,ive been easily getting hours of sot minimum and have occasionally had some hour days hopefully it holds up because this is a dream coming from the moto xs barely hours
Android,not_removed,im getting about hours sot with minimal standby or about hours sot with a decent amount of standby in both instances it is about a half hour more than similar use on my which is definitely nice im also not using as many battery saving functions on my pixel as i was my so its not a comparison and the pixel still wins
Android,not_removed,im happy when i get hours sot on my edge not sure if im doing something wrong ive stopped having location on when im just sitting in my desk at work sitting in a cement cave probably drains that
Android,not_removed,yeah but whats your screen on time
Android,not_removed,huh granted ive only used mine for one full day yet but i was thoroughly unimpressed with the battery i did see the yeelight app for my xiaomi smart bulbs being quite high in the statistics yesterday evening so i force stopped that and didnt open it again hoping it performs noticeably better today
Android,not_removed,hard to say its almost as if with each coming update the battery life worsened for the my friend that rmaed a while back when it was released refused to update because he knew battery life wouldnt be as great as out of the factory
Android,not_removed,lol the irony of your post is that i read it went back to randroid and two posts down was this
Android,not_removed,just wait until google creates a new battery drain bug play services or android system this shouldnt last long
Android,not_removed,were the battery reviews really that good at launch i just remember people being optimist because the battery is so big meanwhile im over here getting sot a day and it dies at
Android,not_removed,my never was this good or this consistent with battery life either
Android,not_removed,really mines still fine on it gets unpredictable once it gets down to or so but i read somewhere thats a bug in this version of the android beta
Android,not_removed,my consistently lasts about hours hours sot mostly browsing reddit i can squeeze about or out of it if im not very active that day
Android,not_removed,i didnt have the but i dont ever recall battery reviews being great for it iirc it was no better than the nexus which was generally disappointing that one i know first hand
Android,not_removed,the nexus also had rave battery reviews at launch every new phone i can remember people touting massive sot gains on their nexus too all of this is meaningless without an objective benchmarking method
Android,not_removed,totally agree i cant even get hours of sot its not hard to get impressed when you come from a
Android,not_removed,that sounds very impressive to me that is iphone plus line territory
Android,not_removed,i was like that one my nexus devices i upgraded to a mi max with a good size battery and consistently getting hours sot
Android,not_removed,i charge my nexus a day
Android,not_removed,i got yesterday with moderatelight use
Android,not_removed,dang i recently ordered the over the because i assumed the battery life would be a all day worthy then again as long as it can do hours of sot ill be happy
Android,not_removed,with a used oneplus one you can get the same stats
Android,not_removed,from what i have seen im lead to believe the battery on the zx is pretty good
Android,not_removed,i switched form the compact to a redmi note pro the redmi has ridiculous battery
Android,not_removed,i tried out the xz for weeks the battery is average and not as amazing as the reviews have said they are i would estimate that its sot is around or less
Android,not_removed,to the which is both cumbersomely large and crappy battery not true for all devices you probably have one of the problem devices because my is still incredible on battery also its not that big
Android,not_removed,i went from to and now to xz and its good to have a battery again here is my usage from today sot total time with some google maps navigation screens below
Android,not_removed,better than what the opo used to be on stock
Android,not_removed,ive been getting great battery life on mine this was a couple days after i got it just havent taken a screenshot since edit this is todays over hours sot on wifi most of the day httpsimgurcomalplcw
Android,not_removed,god thats so mouth watering considering i get like right now
Android,not_removed,now with supersu and greenify intalled the sky is the limit still testing but i have a feeling im going to have ridonculous battery life
Android,not_removed,any idea what app it was that killed it its always seemed like to me if i do a factory reset i have great battery life but then once i start installing apps even if i uninstall them there it all goes
Android,not_removed,mixed there is quite a wide consensum regarding camera and battery life of the pixel phones and both are excelent and on par with all the flagships the main criticisms are dull design a tad bit oversaturated screen and high price in android police ruddock will have an orgasm with the battery life of his xl some day in twitter the verge just published an article with an amazing picture saying they want to emphasise this is the best phone camera ever pixel offers less features than other flagships on par cameraperformance but pixel seems to destroy other flagships wrt touch latency responsiveness thermal throttling and in general consistency and lets not talk about the real exclusive which is the google assistant integration or the neverforget topic of android updates so if you have the money you will not regret the pixel and i certainly wouldnt buy another similarlypriced flagship if you are on a budget you are well served by cheaper alternatives
Android,not_removed,who has given a negative review
Android,not_removed,its because they have a very high expectation lets all remember that this is the first time google made a device which is to compete directly at iphones and i think they did a very good job
Android,not_removed,most of the reviews are pretty great most people actually using the phone only have positive experiences from using it in fact if theres one person ive noticed that has consistently posted and focused only on the negative reviews its been you
Android,not_removed,every review has been positive
Android,not_removed,if youre really interested then testing yourself would be the best option tbh everyone has their own usage patterns and schedules thankfully nowadays its easy to test a device before fully committing to it due to return policies
Android,not_removed,yeah i actually had ended up switching from the because i couldnt have a phone with such a low battery life glad to see theyre dealing with the issue
Android,not_removed,is four hours really all that impressive though my gets me through the day on a single charge with hours of sot keep in mind this is with facebook snapchat instagram etc installed
Android,not_removed,same for me for me i would say better day with around sot enough for me most days gave the phone new life
Android,not_removed,on the edge though youre comparing phones with larger batteries the smaller pixel im using only has the thing is damn efficient
Android,not_removed,this post really isnt about that op started a thread to discuss battery life on the pixel xl not to wonder why you didnt buy one
Android,not_removed,not really ive had enough experience with smartphones by now to be happy and recognize progress when i see it im still getting to know the phone in a lot of other ways
Android,not_removed,thats the phone hes been using what else would he compare it to
Android,not_removed,um im just enjoying the new experience not making a recommendation
Android,not_removed,relax kid let op enjoy his new phone
Android,not_removed,only that im so much happier than i thought i was this aint a buying choice comparison lol
Android,not_removed,day isnt even close to being enough to form an opinion of battery life give it a couple days to settle in and then judge it might be better might be worse but at least it will be accurate
Android,not_removed,i rmad but upgraded to decided to stay off the beta for now and battery life is as good as it ever was
Android,not_removed,ive done the exact same thing back on that sweet sweet battery life
Android,not_removed,probably just an increase in wakelocks over time as people downloaded more and more apps the os has some to do with it but id say half the people here at best know how to check for wakelocks at minimum batteries also lose heath or overall charge over time so those things compounding leads to bad batteries after a while
Android,not_removed,the nougat update botched it up but it has stabilised since then so im happy again
Android,not_removed,a new one theres already so many to choose from
Android,not_removed,yeah people were getting hours sot over a day with everything turned on personally i got over a day on marshmallow toggling only bluetooth and wifi with all my social media apps installed i get around on nougat
Android,not_removed,its fairly common for those on nougat
Android,not_removed,yeah thats not great compared to the battery life a lot of people including myself were getting at launch reviewers were getting hours of sot with heavy use over a day
Android,not_removed,with reddit imgur and facebook browsing my battery life is currently at with hours of sot and been off the charge
Android,not_removed,yeah no one was raving about the the consensus was that it was just ok
Android,not_removed,upgraded
Android,not_removed,recently ordered did you look into any reviews or user experiences i wouldnt recommend it go with oneplus instead
Android,not_removed,why would you assume the or anything with the is all day worthy youll be lucky if its equal to the lol
Android,not_removed,i never got anywhere near that with my old opo
Android,not_removed,been using the moto z play for about a week now have only charged it twice so farshits ridiculous and i dont see any performance drop moving from my either currently at hours of sot took it off the charger a little before on the showing battery still insane battery life
Android,not_removed,i sold my in preparation for the pixel and used a redmi in the meantime hot damn was it nice to literally not have to worry about my battery even into the second day
Android,not_removed,currently sitting at hours screen time with hours so far since last charge im at this is with mostly lte with wifi i jump hours of sot
Android,not_removed,anything weird about the xiaomi phone in my opinion sony kind of typifies really good quality and fit and finish in a phone so i wonder how that chinese phone holds up
Android,not_removed,oh damn thats disappointing to hear but ive read a lot of reviews and mentioned it on this sub befire ans most people have said its stellar ill buy it from a retailer with a good return window though so i can return it if it sucks thanks for the heads up
Android,not_removed,maybe there was something wrong with yours i get between and hours sot from my xz got with remaining today httpiimgurcomdpgfmpdpng
Android,not_removed,the xz grey is which is a similar price if not cheaper than an and i like sony for their flavour of android
Android,not_removed,also its not that big this is an entirely subjective opinion you dont get to decide that for other people
Android,not_removed,much better than the opo on stock or whatever it was called before it was renamed cos even better than rooted opo with a custom rom
Android,not_removed,looks good thanks you might wanna add those to the op
Android,not_removed,this alone is worth it for now at least
Android,not_removed,i get about and yeah seriously sot is i dont have to worry about charging my phone during the day good
Android,not_removed,is greenify really necessary in todays android i used to use it back in days but i dont find my system really sucking extra power
Android,not_removed,im really not sure as i had a whole bunch upgrading on sunday
Android,not_removed,the assistant integration is artificially exclusive google couldve brought it to all android phones lets not praise their phone for a feature that shouldve been on all recent flagships google made a decent phone for an expensive price it is the best at some things but loses at others i would say it does enough to compete but not enough to achieve universal praise
Android,not_removed,i think flossy carter was underwhelmed by pixel battery life
Android,not_removed,and they should have a high expectation at this price range
Android,not_removed,i dont know but this is hours with left of charge im just really happy about not needing to think about charging my battery throughout the day
Android,not_removed,if i use my pixel like you do i get around to hrs of sot if i use it over days it drops to around hrs and i dont even have the xl httpimgurcomafaruj
Android,not_removed,my was a champ id get all day battery life with hours sot and still have around when id go to bed my gets maybe hours and has to be charged on my way home from work usually with only hours sot and poor cell reception but the same office as with the google just doesnt seem to care about battery optimization with nexus phones
Android,not_removed,exactly
Android,not_removed,right so if i had been using a blackberry curve up until today it would make sense to post about how incredible the pixels battery is the point is dont even mention the its not relevant
Android,not_removed,yeah i figured
Android,not_removed,the beta for me actually fixed my battery life issues of but ymmv edit if your happy with your current battery life no need to go to beta
Android,not_removed,too much fragmentation create a new one to solve fragmentation problem allo
Android,not_removed,thats impressive i know that i have to anticipate slightly worse performance when im using android wear all day but what i get now was bad enough for me to order a moto z play
Android,not_removed,i dont typically use my phone very much hours sot is heavy usage for me im sure i could get that number out of my phone i just dont use it that much
Android,not_removed,im still getting that battery life it seems you either have a bad battery or the battery life was consistent since launch
Android,not_removed,i get sot everyday and had been since i got the phone update to seems to even have improved that a bit im totally stock and have everything enabled no greenify or any special optimization i firmly believe the drains come from third party apps or a combination of and that the problem is mainly that this drain is hidden behind the android system
Android,not_removed,is amazing for me except battery i usually get around but it charges so fast that i dont really care how bad it is plus the standby is amazing
Android,not_removed,maybe uundiscovered is buying one used can buy you a much better phone than an but for the theyre going for on swappa theyre not a bad deal
Android,not_removed,really i actually did and i thought it was impressive even my cant touch my opo
Android,not_removed,the battery on my opo has decreased by but i still get hours of sot with sultans rom atleast im on a based rom now getting hours of sot
Android,not_removed,crazy that you get to say the date of when you took it off the charger instead of what time
Android,not_removed,progress in battery life is a beautiful thing
Android,not_removed,definitely do this i used the phone primarily with bt headphones some plex during lunch reddit and emails i did find that my battery was more consistent if i was also more consistent and not opening closing the phone other than that great phone please get it in forest blue lol you wont be disappointed
Android,not_removed,i get sot from my xz see my screenshots elsewhere in the thread
Android,not_removed,to preface my version was international on tmobile not sure if it makes a difference if i had that kind of battery i wouldve kept it
Android,not_removed,i have to say that their skin of android is really really good double tap to sleepwake gestures and swipe to google now
Android,not_removed,lmao then neither do you
Android,not_removed,i got hours sot and hours standby a few days ago on my exynos i just put my phone on the charger an hour ago with hours sot over hours too so its pretty consistently awesome
Android,not_removed,im so excited to get this phone
Android,not_removed,depends on the user really helps on standby battery but once all apps are greenified opening them would be slow since they were greenified but there a shallow hibernation feature that i think eliminates slowness
Android,not_removed,it has new specific alterations for doze eg aggressive doze and a few others id say its worth looking into so far i cant tell much of a difference but ive only started using it a few hours ago
Android,not_removed,i recently got some yeelight xiaomi smart bulbs and that yeelight app is sucking battery on my pixel just downloaded greenify not rooted though to see if hibernating it makes a difference im expecting good results
Android,not_removed,im smelling hypocrisy here some other features that could have been on other phones but wasnt for whatever reason updates i want to use java but older phones prevent me from using the newer sugar multiscreen oh wait phones can get this feature but wait they have to update first samsung and lg have their own multiscreen support features under their own sdk im one of those devs that will not touch the samsung sdk in a million years because theyre not designed as well surprisingly as the google sdks which everyone has to use anyway security youd think that reddit would freak out with getting anything other than a blackberry nexus pixel or iphone considering what rworldnews is talking about accurate fingerprint scanners for those that have them this changed after the but before the every other phones were crap including the iphone and camera with good lowlight performance the htc sony motorola and lg phones the exception being the have good sensors but crappy lowlight performance due to whatever preprocessing that they fail to have this isnt an issue with the nexus iphone and samsungs of course they can put the assistant out on the market but what has prevented samsung from giving away their stylus features as an option for other oems android is an open platform the only two big manufacturers that give to the core of android aosp have been google and sony and we shouldnt expect google to give more than they want if we dont expect other manufacturers like samsung from also not giving
Android,not_removed,apple could bring imessage to all android phones too
Android,not_removed,yes and with you many others and i guess once youve gone full pixel theres no way back every other android phone right now is a second citizen
Android,not_removed,exactly what i expected everone hated it but when people started getting their hands on it most people seem to love it just like the last year
Android,not_removed,well for me it really delivered well edit and i think those negative points were subjective except for the speaker it sure was a downgrade but read that sound quality is much better
Android,not_removed,okay sorry about that i also read the mixed reviews about the low light but from using my pixel im for the most part impressed with it even in low light
Android,not_removed,flash photography on it has been kinda weird low light has been incredibly good otherwise in daylight well the dynamic range of this sensor is breathtaking
Android,not_removed,hours with left is way different from just saying hours lol you need to say how much battery you have left or do the math and extrapolate about how much sot you would get if you took the battery down to
Android,not_removed,i havent had to think about battery life since the galaxy iphone nexus s galaxy note edge what are some of you doing to your phones running antutu im no light user but the only time i ran out of battery was when i left the house with and used navigation streaming music for most of the day anywayhuge pinch of salt with any xx hours of sot posts not that you are lying just that theres too much variation
Android,not_removed,thats pretty impressive might even get one if no major flaws pop up in a month or so though to be fair my phones battery has been through well over charge cycles and still goes through a day of use easily have had it for about years now its a shame sony stopped making phones like these
Android,not_removed,why is the not relevant hes impressed about the battery life coming from his previous phone which happens to be the which is very relevant to the subject matter
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i firmly believe youre wrong there are plenty of people that have factory reset run phones in safe mode run without installing any apps that have the android system and android os drain while i personally havent had it happen to me there are plenty of postsscreenshots for you to peruse in just because we havent had problems doesnt mean we should ignore those that have had problems also there are people who have had perfectly normal battery life on marshmallow to see it go away on nougat going back to marshmallow or rma also resolved the problem for them
Android,not_removed,tell me honestly when you go searching for a wife do you seek specifications of vitals or seek companionship if youre into vital stats then surely you will love mi max but if you love companionship that is a smooth ride then there is no way a mi max can come close to a nexus
Android,not_removed,yup got it for
Android,not_removed,yeah i dont know but i maxed out at like hours of screen on time but that was at best at school i got a lot better signal than i did in my hometown because i had piss poor signal at home so at school id average around hours sot and at home id average hours
Android,not_removed,i ran sultan and never really broke hours sot ever i got slightly more than my does now but i wouldnt consider it stellar by any stretch i always saw opo users bragging about their screen on times and wondered why i couldnt achieve the same do you do anything to decrease battery consumption i just used my phone normally and uninstalled anything that murdered my battery life
Android,not_removed,right i still havent put it back on the charger yet sitting at battery and just over hours sot this thing forcing me to relearn charging habits i keep sort of panicking and checkin it every minutes or so to make sure its not deadthen feel stupid that it hasnt gone down at all its seriously like the old days with flip phones
Android,not_removed,its either blue or silver ill end up deciding at the last second haha what did you switch to and how would you compare the cameras
Android,not_removed,yay youre learning
Android,not_removed,agreed i have the same model i dont have any actual numbers but very pleased with the sot and battery in general and i havent even disabled any of the samsung packages ive heard the vr app sucks quite a bit of battery but i havent disabled it yet
Android,not_removed,aggressive doze definitely feels worth it to me on not sure if it would still be needed on though
Android,not_removed,well google is responsible for the android ecosystem the other oems are responsible for their respective phones would you have the same response if google stopped updating aosp and instead kept all new features for pixel phones every nonhardware dependent feature on the pixel that is being withheld is something that could have gone to the ecosystem oems have no responsibility to do this because they manufacture their phones and dont maintain the underlying os and its ecosystem this is an apples to oranges comparison as for most of the features youve listed most of them rely on hardware the ones that dont still get out to the ecosystem but android isnt supporting older hardware for that long
Android,not_removed,its kinda hard not to love it difficult to find a case i like at the moment though
Android,not_removed,to be fair the did look pretty awful in the leaks the glass camera bar visor looked a lot bigger and more accentuated in the pictures looks much more subtle and prettier in person
Android,not_removed,of the software hdr is the real hero
Android,not_removed,for a two year old phonebattery thats really impressive i agree i hope the pixel is that good by the end of two years when i plan to replace it
Android,not_removed,because it had trash battery so of course the pixel is impressive comparatively like i said with the blackberry example theres no point in even mentioning it
Android,not_removed,thats a bad comparison since the mi max is pretty smooth
Android,not_removed,comparing a wife with a phone purchase
Android,not_removed,shitty parallel try the spouse thing again but this time choose features and wording that mirror the devices in question youre on to something but botched your first try
Android,not_removed,when you go searching for a wife im pretty sure thats not how it works
Android,not_removed,its not only about vital stats for the mi max im still a nexus fan but its hard to argue against xiaomi that these devices offer similar performances at less than half the prices so to classify things as black and white for the mi max and lets just say they both have their set of users
Android,not_removed,during kitkat times the phone could easily get sot if you could push it when i upgraded to lollipop it went down to hours now with marshmallow its barely getting sot many people noticed this in the forums could it be due to this
Android,not_removed,did you have poor reception most of the time that absolutely kills battery life
Android,not_removed,xposed with gravity box there you can enable automatic switching between and when screen is off or on that way i got around hour of extra sot
Android,not_removed,i came from a and went back to it camera wise the xz is fast and reliable but slow to load pictures also come out noisy in low or medium light due to software the is better now with the new google camera apk
Android,not_removed,yeah i thought that one of the features on was more aggressive doze by default
Android,not_removed,well google is responsible for the android ecosystem the other oems are responsible for their respective phones theyre only responsible for their flavor of android android is open source and the only reason we devs build for the play store is because the apis they give google maps etc aka google play services is better than everything else out there and the fact every phone will end up with the google play store maybe im thinking too much on the open source perspective but it is a privilege that google and sony are the most active contributors to aosp aka core android if amazon didnt screw up their android ecosystem years ago we could have seen a different version of android where most devs would be developing on amazons apis instead of googles would you have the same response if google stopped updating aosp and instead kept all new features for pixel phones this is an apples to oranges comparison no i have a and i wouldnt be surprised either way if the google assistant would be out because ive always considered google an oem and not the owner of android which is an open source os id consider them a maintainer but maintainers can fork their own version of the os too as evidenced by the differences between aosp android the nexus os and the pixel os when we talk about different flavors of android of them are forks of aosp be it from cyanogenmod to touchwiz to nexuss flavor of android oems have no responsibility to do this because they manufacture their phones and dont maintain the underlying os and its ecosystem based on my dev experience on the android os each oem has actually forked their own version of android and its their responsibility to keep their software on the phone up to date including the kernel one obvious example of obvious os forking is touchwiz where the some of the base android api functions do something different than all other oem flavors of android because they simply like to tinker with the internals of the os for no reason this is the biggest reason why only a handful of phones consistently update not to mention the little bits of other manufacturer dependencies that phone manufacturers have to wait for processor bluetooth drivers modems etc are not coded by the manufacturer but by companies like qualcomm in order to get their phones up to date it isnt android that isnt supporting older hardware its either the manufacturer that neglects updating their software or the hardware makers unwilling to codeupgrade the kernel pixel is still on the linux kernel because of qualcomm despite the fact that the linux kernel is on version which has nicer arm enhancements
Android,not_removed,thats randroid for you
Android,not_removed,that happens every year when the first leaks of the nexus came out i was in awe i wanted to have sex with my nexus because it was so much better looking fast forward years and here i am still finding my insanely beautiful
Android,not_removed,blackberry curve is such an extreme example the point still stands the his previous phone a flagship android device is very relevant to the subject matter if he didnt mention what phone he came from i guarantee there will be multiple users asking what phone he came from
Android,not_removed,lol dont take it too seriously that anologyits reddit i am no xiaomi hater in fact i do believe that theyve been doing things of late that are nothing short of commendable but sadly theyre xiaomi and have that dreadful skin you may like it but i just dont see myself using it like they say everyone thinks theyve the prettiest wife
Android,not_removed,well the car advertisements place bikini clad women all over cars trying to show how sexy the car looks the astrologers compare your entire life looking at a set of stars so would that be a crime if i did the same just a bit differently lol
Android,not_removed,calm down dracula
Android,not_removed,arrange marriage ever heard of this thing
Android,not_removed,at home yeshorrible reception i usually didnt have cell signal no i didnt live in the middle of nowhere tmobile just sucked in my area i had great service at school the difference in battery life was staggering
Android,not_removed,the point stands that they both have atrocious battery life of course your brand new pixel is going to have better battery theres literally no point in what he said when he compared it to the
Android,not_removed,dracula zakkdango
Android,not_removed,you dont go searching for a wife in an arranged marriage either
Android,not_removed,lol its even got the ios rubber band effect still by the way you showed the launcher there mostly
Android,not_removed,circular icons miui
Android,not_removed,dracula zakkdango hahaha
Android,not_removed,yea right forgot you go searching for peanut butter no
Android,not_removed,absolutely i like to buy the creamy kind
Android,not_removed,the one that jizzes all over the place once you open the can yea i know that feeling
Android,not_removed,i love that cool creamy peanut jizz all over my banana sandwiches
Android,not_removed,to be clear he didnt say anything was definitely coming to allo all he did was list the most popular suggestions
Android,not_removed,wrong not coming just suggestion hes received
Android,not_removed,yes as utherealkidkudi said the whole tweet says that these were suggestions come on op
Android,not_removed,knowing google theyll probably make a new im for those features because
Android,not_removed,and everyone was down voting me earlier i believed in sms i believed in google 🙏
Android,not_removed,you are forgetting that we are in randroid land where if we speculation hard enough it becomes a reality
Android,not_removed,yup id be happy enough with a desktop app quick reply and smsdont use it much but at least the sub wont complain
Android,not_removed,he didnt say any of those were coming to allo those were the most popular suggestions hes received
Android,not_removed,i really doubt full sms will ever come allo is going to push rcs when all the carriers get their shit together if it wasnt built with rcs in mind they would have just put assistant into messenger
Android,not_removed,you are forgetting that we are in randroid land where if we speculation hard enough it becomes a reality we will be setup for disappointment ftfy
Android,not_removed,using vr i can see it right in front of me
Android,not_removed,rcs uses sms fallback so i would think sms would have to be implemented for rcs to be implemented
Android,not_removed,storage options are theyre definitely from the future
Android,not_removed,it needs a way of filtering out games with an icon of a guy yelling
Android,not_removed,why do you wanna hide cheetah mobile apps 😂
Android,not_removed,forget that why doesnt it even have basic sorting and filtering like a shopping website price rating number of downloads relevance etc
Android,not_removed,oh i thought maybe you were trying to hide grindr from the gf
Android,not_removed,well the play store should allow you to install all the apps related to your account with one button otherwise whats the point of the all tab next to the installed one
Android,not_removed,same applies for the website version of play store for my apps it still shows apps i used when i had my first android phone with gingerbread
Android,not_removed,the play store should allow you to do a lot of things like why the fuck when you search for something the unpaid version shows but the version you purchased doesnt
Android,not_removed,i need it to be able to hide games i will never install a game on my phone i do not want to see any of that garbage a not interested button would be nice for individual apps
Android,not_removed,why do you want to hide all the ram downloading apps
Android,not_removed,i dont think it will ever happen as it will hamper download counts of companies like chitah mobile
Android,not_removed,every app that you search for results should allow you to hide repeat items
Android,not_removed,it should also allow one to multiselect apps for update and add them all to a queue
Android,not_removed,honestly the data that could be collected from that simple feature would really help improve the app rankings being able to hide an entire developer would be helpful also
Android,not_removed,the recommended for you section has this feature in a way when you click on the ••• menu link for the app you get an extra option that says not interested i once saw a damn donald trump app and clicked on not interested and didnt see it again after a day or so
Android,not_removed,they need to make a filter that gets rid of certain types of content like my little sister downloaded a kid game just once and now thats all i see
Android,not_removed,i just want to hide every single app thats not free no in appgame shop allowed no demo allowed this would be so great because right now i dont use the play store anymore way too much work i will never spend money on an app especially not when they have zero uses the only one i bought is relay for reddit because i use it every day and it adds value
Android,not_removed,write a tampermonkey script and remove them
Android,not_removed,you dont want to download clash of warrior age vikings
Android,not_removed,google considers cheetah mobile a success story httpswwwgooglecomadmobsuccesshtml link in full just in case you thought i was joking
Android,not_removed,cheetah crap company buys a cool app and ruins it
Android,not_removed,weird considering that creating a search engine is what google is famous for
Android,not_removed,i literally searched for an app i know the name of last week and it didnt show up i had to go to googlecom type it in and then open the link redirecting me to the play store to download it
Android,not_removed,you can long press and batch install though
Android,not_removed,you can remove them there is a x towards the right side of screen
Android,not_removed,tip over of microtransactions happen in games google has an interest in showing you games
Android,not_removed,not even the room
Android,not_removed,afaik devs only pay for the ads on the mains screen and when you search but the top lists are sorted by actual statistics
Android,not_removed,yeah thats not how it works
Android,not_removed,so youre happy to spend on phones but on apps
Android,not_removed,yes becuase that is so easy and works on the google play app s
Android,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomprswtkfpng
Android,not_removed,crazy
Android,not_removed,well even though they are trash they made a success out of themselves think about all that ads money
Android,not_removed,this right here demonstrates perfectly where users really stand in googles perspective if google really cared about android users they would be trying to purge shit like this from the play store but having a platform where cancerous software like this can thrive and turn a profit is something they boast about not that the app store is much better but while incompetence is disheartening outright hostility is worse
Android,not_removed,shit
Android,not_removed,yes the apps are crazycrap but people use them a lot
Android,not_removed,manipulating their search lists to maximize cash is what google is famous for
Android,not_removed,explain when i long press nothing happens when i let go it goes into the app i just selected id love to be able to select only the apps i want to update like a checkbox on the side rather than go into each one to do it seems like a simple thing
Android,not_removed,im saying on the website desktop theres no x s to remove them
Android,not_removed,games are easily the biggest sector in apps for downloads too on top of your accurate revenue comment
Android,not_removed,i bought the phone because of its features not because of the possible shitty apps
Android,not_removed,lets examine the other options that are never going to happen write a custom app store app get google to do what you want them to do
Android,not_removed,only where
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,this is glorious
Android,not_removed,was a joke everyone knows the best is age of clan warfare royale unloaded castle raiders ii
Android,not_removed,omg dude your sim card is damaged i hope youve installed du cleaner to fix the issues
Android,not_removed,well people believe in alternative medicine for phones
Android,not_removed,long press only works in all
Android,not_removed,you have to long press apps that you dont already have installed
Android,not_removed,and even on the app you have to do that one by one i remember once you could multiselect them
Android,not_removed,and your option doesnt work as well so we all lose
Android,not_removed,write a custom app store app never going to happen httpsfdroidorgrepositorybrowsefdidcomgithubyeriominyalpstore
Android,not_removed,only there
Android,not_removed,ill stick to ass thank you very much
Android,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvmfcudqjpg
Android,not_removed,youre talking about tournament edition right
Android,not_removed,but ii is
Android,not_removed,what causes them and what can i do to stop them
Android,not_removed,there isnt even a flag to disable it or permission to access vibration motor
Android,not_removed,yeah well my sim card is damaged bet you guys didnt even get du security and du speed booster too no wonder your sim card is damaged s
Android,not_removed,i just tested it and youre right i finally know what people are talking about so thank you and that is utterly worthless to what im talking about and what i think makes more sense i mean you cant even batch deleteremove from that screen only batch install theres a reason those apps arent on my phone anymore
Android,not_removed,you can still long press one to select multiple apps but you can only batch install them not remove them from the list
Android,not_removed,at least it would work as opposed to not working
Android,not_removed,this is about filtering unwanted play store apps
Android,not_removed,ranimeirl
Android,not_removed,wtf is that description lol
Android,not_removed,damn you guys still play that theres a new one out you know age of clan warfare royale unloaded castle raiders iii tournament edition saga iv
Android,not_removed,only an ad blocker will do the job you usually need root for them i heard there was one that doesnt need root but i cant quite remember how its called as for what causes them if you click on the links in these popups they usually redirect you to some app in the play store that claims to be an antivirus thats bullshit androids dont need an antivirus if you know what you are doing as long as you dont click on shady links and download suspicious apps you are fine i clicked on the ad once just to fuck around and it redirected me to clean master which is an app from cheetah mobile no joke edit here is that non root ad blocker httpswwwsevencomandroidadblockerdownloadphp
Android,not_removed,without root adaway with root problem solved
Android,not_removed,yeah thats what i meant
Android,not_removed,and mobile and about of the user base
Android,not_removed,you seem pretty good at this can you just write the script and post it with a guide here
Android,not_removed,i like what the other commenter said please write this script for us less talented users with the same problem
Android,not_removed,firefox has ad blocking extensions
Android,not_removed,adguard is one that doesnt need root it uses a vpn
Android,not_removed,works best imo
Android,not_removed,the only option on mobile would be firefox and greasemonkey but then i install apps just as equally in chrome on my laptop as i do on my tablet
Android,not_removed,ive used tampermonkey and greasemonkey for some trivial things like manipulating web sites to display content a certain way but i have no issue with filtering play store content so im not going to undertake something i have no interest in
Android,not_removed,forgot about that one i stopped using it cause chrome is way faster
Android,not_removed,app
Android,not_removed,are you sure youre not just spewing techno babble and trying to make it to the top of riamverysmart
Android,not_removed,yeah but the ads are honestly too much especially on mobile id rather no ads and less speed
Android,not_removed,i actually found the opposite especially with video chrome takes ages to load video while firefox does it nearly instantly
Android,not_removed,i just had a quick look at the top free in android apps in the play store html so theres a couple of ways to do this but i think i would iterate though all of the card norationale squarecover apps small classes in the dom using a jquery loop and insert a styledisplay none into the div tag where the content contained the name of the app or company i wanted to filter i would also need an array to lookup all of the apps or companies i wanted to filter div classcard norationale squarecover apps small datadocidcomfacebookorca dataoriginalclassescard norationale squarecover apps small datashortclassescard norationale squarecover apps small datathinclassescard norationale squarecover apps small div classcardcontent idtrackclick idtrackimpression datadocidcomfacebookorca
Android,not_removed,if you dont feel comfortable with rooting your phone its a great solution i myself used it before i rooted mine
Android,not_removed,this doesnt work on my phone i thought you said your way was going to work
Android,not_removed,sure it does install firefox download the greasemonkey extension and write your script
Android,not_removed,i thought you were going to write the script
Android,not_removed,why would i write the script for something i dont care about why dont you go to rhowtojavascript and learn to fish
Android,not_removed,because you said you could do it and it would work thus far ive seen no results
Android,not_removed,where did i say i would do it as for the results it was in that technobabble you didnt understand
Android,not_removed,so weve confirmed it was just jargon and not a proper resolution now it makes more sense
Android,not_removed,well if you understood the jargon and techno babble i posted then you could do it yourself next time you call someone out on the techno babble be sure you know what youre talking about
Android,not_removed,im still not sure you know what youre talking about because my app store still doesnt have a filter wouldnt it be easier to just put an app in the app store then the app store would have an app to filter the apps in the store
Android,not_removed,my solution was to use tampermonkey for chrome to do the filtering and if you knew what you were talking about then no it would not be easier to put an app in the play store to do the filtering why dont you write an app to do the filtering
Android,not_removed,nfc ive wanted nfc as a system level feature for android wear since the concept of a smartwatch was introduced i want to be able to walk into a meeting tap an nfc chip with my wrist and have a link or file open on my tablet or chromebook i want to be able to exchange contacts with a handshake or reach into a cutting edge vending machine that reads my wrist as i put my hand in a slot the machine charges my card and dispenses a snack or drink for me to grab and go on my way just being able to use your hand as an identifier that activates any context specific function would be super cool and theres no reason why it hasnt happened already
Android,not_removed,purpose it needs purpose
Android,not_removed,id love a wristmounted interface to assistant with notifications messaging of my pebble usage is notification interaction complicating it much further seems unnecessary of course thats for my use case not others
Android,not_removed,yep the fact that android wear has round smartwatches should be enough for consumer to take note
Android,not_removed,hopefully google takes the pixel approach in advertising this time around but really android wear is just a buggy platform that doesnt really offer much unique features compare to apple watch and gear s
Android,not_removed,actually here in germany ive seen quite a lot of commercials for the fossil q and i believe polar has done advertisement on tv too
Android,not_removed,so true tons of people comment on my huawei they never know what it is but they always like it better than the apple watch wow the screen is always on it actually looks like a real watch
Android,not_removed,with the current advertising for the pixel in india at least when google releases their pixel watch you bet your ass there will be mass advertising
Android,not_removed,battery life rated in weeks not days good looks too when you get a watch you want excessively long battery life and for it to look good since its basically a fashion product majority of smartwatches fail both of those
Android,not_removed,android pay
Android,not_removed,i used to use android wear now i wear an apple watch as i have an iphone but google needs to step up their interface and fitness features it takes me longer to turn off my moto compared to my apple watch and apples fitness tracking is superior and somewhat more accurate than google fit on my but google now will always be better than siri though
Android,not_removed,removable batteries these watches should be lasting way more that years
Android,not_removed,it needs fluidity and useful functions which can be a game changer in smart watches up to now all the watches seemingly have the same functionality
Android,not_removed,as a lg g watchandroid wear user from day i dont care about any of this love my watch
Android,not_removed,maybe people know you can buy smartwatches but maybe theyre just too expensive bulky expensive have a poor battery life limited functionality expensive or all of the above
Android,not_removed,they useless
Android,not_removed,what you want is the samsung gear has that plus samsung pay and you dont need to use it with a samsung phone it is also very expensive
Android,not_removed,iirc there is some nfc stuff in the latest android wear preview but nobody can figure out how to use it
Android,not_removed,nfc is not the answer no one knows that android wear watches exist or is a thing
Android,not_removed,yep bought the g watch r when it came out wore it for a few months went back to seiko it was slick too slick almost made my phone useless thats the problem it does practically everything your phone already does if it didnt look so ridiculous id wear a android watch with its own lte and never buy another phone but thats really what its about its just not quite worth the convenience of having some features on your wrist vs the combination of how it looks plus not having to pull your phone out not sure when phone holsters dropped outta style i know i dont wanna wear one but if ya had one integrated into a wristband with a smallerlighter phone thatd probly be the ticket if people could get past the looks of it vs the fit bits and apple watches ive seen id guess itd at least be worth a shot it really just comes down to web surfing and maps and maybe games pretty much nothing else requires a bigger screen but if you cant go wo then youre carrying a phone anyhow so why have both i suspect some people run into the same issue with tablets if they insist on a larger phone and a smaller tablet theres no point if people got to where they could use android auto for mapsweb and maybe games and kept tablets at workhome i could see where a watch could become little more than what they are today plus ltehotspot in fact for now itd maybe make more sense to carry a hotspot and a watch itd need to work with a tablet left at home instead of the way it does with a phone of course you could even keep a tablet wo its own battery in your car and plug it into the hotspot for power that way it could sit in your car for weeks wo worrying about heatcoldcharge the once in a while youd actually need it away from your car otherwise auto of course if you otherwise spend a significant amount of time away from workhomecar then youll probly never get away from a larger phone
Android,not_removed,i had a first generation motor and it was super pointless other than making me look cool and making people think i was super rich it did nothing the phone call function was useless since i had to pull out my phone the second i swiped the watch
Android,not_removed,it does have purpose for certain people i ride a motorcycle and the gps function of it combined with my smartphone make it paramount for traveling id get a mount for my phone but im not trusting of not having my phone on my handlebars when going mph on the road it is weird how one of the things i criticized the most of smartwatches is now my favorite thing about it not having to look at your phone to get information
Android,not_removed,for what its worth in the developer previews for wear the voice search was renamed to assistant and shows the google assistant icon when you launch it i dont know if its the real assistant like on the pixels or just renamed voice search but its something
Android,not_removed,some kind of alwayslistening or super fast response would be great on my moto i hated the big delay between speaking and response audio replies would be great too and of course full assistant support would be great then just throw in nfc and a battery
Android,not_removed,am i the only one who would rather have a square screen i guess thats what i get for trusting pebble though
Android,not_removed,im running beta software on my huawei watch and its not buggy for me what watch do you have
Android,not_removed,buggy do you have an android wear watch
Android,not_removed,advertisement where you are saying that you see these ads on tv and offline like the apple watch
Android,not_removed,thing is theyve said there is no pixel watch that the watches coming out will be more likened to nexus
Android,not_removed,thats not why watches are not selling no one knows that they exist
Android,not_removed,apple watch is good lol the apple watch ui is the worst shit ever
Android,not_removed,i agree
Android,not_removed,right but it also isnt an android wear device
Android,not_removed,yep got one for christmas and its awesome battery life is unbelievable slightly over days with always on display dont really care about most missing apps as long as i can control my play music im happy
Android,not_removed,well i do think that they need a better ad campaign too but if you baked those nfc features i described into their next line of smartwatches and then aired an ad showing people doing those things android smartwatches would be flying off the shelves it would also be nice if they released a pixel watch so customers dont get confused by androids relationship with manufacturers
Android,not_removed,but if ya had one integrated into a wristband with a smallerlighter phone thatd probly be the ticket if people could get past the looks of it ive wanted a proper welldesigned wristforearm phone holster for ages fuck what people think id feel like iron man and thats the only thing that matters
Android,not_removed,you and i have very different g watch r s for the looks of it for me its a kind of nice thing to have if i remember to charge it
Android,not_removed,it does have purpose for certain people very true its a niche use case but my favorite thing to do with my first gen moto is being able to control my music when im skiing without having to pull out my phone
Android,not_removed,id get a mount for my phone but im not trusting of not having my phone on my handlebars when going mph on the road good choice how many people fucked up the camera lens in the htc edit seriously its a known issue it plagued the more than other phones because the glass wasnt flush enough apparently not noticeable when lookingtouching it but the glass vibrating a bunch isnt good on any camera phones with sapphire glass and smaller lenses may fair better
Android,not_removed,i dont doubt that theyll bring it to wear just that they might be trying to do too much with the platform instead of focusing on a few core features
Android,not_removed,judging by the fact that all android wear watches are now round yes you are a minority in this regard
Android,not_removed,same here a circle screen just seems weird to me but thats just my preference gonna wear my pebble time steel until its dying breath
Android,not_removed,the pebble community is still thriving and i think well eventually get a timeline os replacement from third party developers so hopefully we can stick it out for a while
Android,not_removed,original moto
Android,not_removed,i have the original moto so i dont have the latest android wear updates other watch experiences may be better but my watch would randomly crash and disconnect the wrist gestures rarely work and overall just feel like a buggy experience also to clarify theres nothing wrong with android wear it just doesnt have any standout features and could be a better user experience imo
Android,not_removed,do you
Android,not_removed,in germany
Android,not_removed,i only watch prosieben so theres that but i have yet to see offlineads for android wear
Android,not_removed,fossilq ads on dutch tv too
Android,not_removed,near the front of the latest wired magazine ive also seen nixon mission getting promoted heavily on amazon though that may be getting targeted to me because of my viewing habits
Android,not_removed,i hope theyre made by google though
Android,not_removed,well im sure people know the apple watch exists theres that at least
Android,not_removed,youre not the guy from rsc are you
Android,not_removed,we do and we still dont want one
Android,not_removed,i find it easier and smoother to navigate than android wear though lots of scrolling with android wear watchos doesnt make sense when you look at screenshots though yes
Android,not_removed,you sound like an android fanboy
Android,not_removed,true what do get from android wear that you cant get on the gear
Android,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqsethrich
Android,not_removed,considering the fact that the square apple watch outsold all aw watches combined round or square the customers do seem to want square watches
Android,not_removed,just because they manufacture a thing en mass doesnt mean the majority of the humans want it
Android,not_removed,gonna wear my pebble time steel until its dying breath oh dont remind me i dont want to think about my time dying
Android,not_removed,i had one of those before i got my huawei and it was slow not buggy what problems are you having
Android,not_removed,well it makes sense for android wear manufacturers to advertise in germany since most people use android devices in germany the apple watch doesnt have one of its best features apple pay and people are wealthy enough to think about getting a smartwatch
Android,not_removed,thats bullshitso in years you saw ads in random places this compares to samsung and apple promoting their products on tv during major events
Android,not_removed,not at all more like how the lg was the first phone to come with nougat these watches are going to be the first ones with aw
Android,not_removed,what does that have to do with android wear and people not knowing that they exist people buy apple watch because its made by apple and is available in every apple retail store and they have advertisement for the products
Android,not_removed,rsquaredcircle boyz
Android,not_removed,because most of this sub is made up of cheapos
Android,not_removed,revisionist history
Android,not_removed,apps android wear has about apps in the store tizen has
Android,not_removed,are you just following me posting random insane ramblings now
Android,not_removed,thats hardly a meaningful comparison as they are two completely different platforms if apple would have sold a round version that would have been a good comparison
Android,not_removed,its probably safe to assume that all the manufacturers who released square android wear watches stopped doing so because they didnt sell enough
Android,not_removed,most people use android worldwide its a fact apples marketshare isnt larger than android
Android,not_removed,im sure people know it exists but dont have any compelling reasons to get one i for one have held off on getting a smartwatch because of the reasons that i listed and because my phone on its own makes a pretty okay watch if not a bit of a clunky one since i have to take it out of my pocket to check the time and im not the only one like that
Android,not_removed,then why is the pixel and galaxy recommended cause theyre cheap
Android,not_removed,twelve whole apps huh
Android,not_removed,huh its way more than that ive a big list of apps i can launch on android wear they usually come in the form of regular apps with a wear bonus
Android,not_removed,our apps look much cooler tho
Android,not_removed,you know i thought about that for a while i started this whole shit with the first samsung gear watch and when it ran on tizen it was great id get my notifications answer my calls and i could take pictures and videos from my wrist which was useful a few times battery lasted days easily apps were available and a lot of them accomplished what you wanted to do android wear isnt doing so great right now and all i do with it is get notifications because the rest of the shit you can do either doesnt work or isnt reliable enough i wouldnt mind jumping over to the gear it looks awesome and support samsung pay which i use way more than android pay anyways since it has rewards and loop pay theyll have apps and if its popular enough devs will back it even more
Android,not_removed,yeah it would sell the same if the apple watch were round
Android,not_removed,why android wear is ios compatible if i really want a round smartwatch i would buy one and use it with the iphone
Android,not_removed,why android wear is ios compatible if i really want a round smartwatch i would buy one and use it with the iphone
Android,not_removed,maybe their watches sucked dick
Android,not_removed,why dont you go ask people if they know about the moto huawei watch or lg watch they clearly dont know so explain why every android flagship phone flop outside of samsung and pixel nowandroid problem is a awareness
Android,not_removed,everyone callscalled the pixel overpriced on here
Android,not_removed,shit i just checked its now
Android,not_removed,science has gone too far
Android,not_removed,was wondering how long it would be before someone would miss the joke
Android,not_removed,the only reason im not ditching my huawei watch is because i lost weight and the gear looks absurd on my wrist heck i had to make an extra hole in my huaweis band to make it fit properly
Android,not_removed,how many people are aware that android wear is compatible with ios i dont even think that is advertised very prominently in any ads which by the way are almost non existent
Android,not_removed,android wear works with ios in that itll show you notifications like any other fitness band does cant interact with the notifications or do much else if someone has an iphone and is considering getting a smartwatch theyll be getting an apple watch edit yeah an apple watch not another iphone
Android,not_removed,android wear giving you some functionality when paired with ios doesnt make it compatible
Android,not_removed,you guys are underestimating how many people buy the apple watch so they can show off they bought it like a piece of jewelry they dont read spec sheets or look into the specifics of the better features of android wear many are there to buy an apple product first smartwatch second
Android,not_removed,its very limited in functionality on ios and most apple users tend to buy mostly apple products that should come as a surprise to noone
Android,not_removed,you seem really determined that android wear is ios compatible as others have pointed out it provides basic notifications if thats all you want there are smartwatchesfitness bands that will do the same thing
Android,not_removed,nobody knows android exists sure
Android,not_removed,you think its a good deal
Android,not_removed,and i wouldve gotten away with it if not for you meddling kids
Android,not_removed,the gear looks much better on smaller wrists
Android,not_removed,they are no android wear ads the android oems are the worse when it comes to product awareness no one knows that they exist outside of samsung
Android,not_removed,but they already have an iphone why would they get another i kid i kid
Android,not_removed,ah yeah the old apple buyers dont know better has it ever occurred to you that the apple watch is one of the best if not the best smartwatch and if you have an iphone and want one it makes sense to buy that one instead of competing products the people who dont research what products are better are in the majority yes but you only see them as apple buyers even though other companys likes samsung have the same effect people generally dont care not just apple buyers sorry i may have ranted a bit
Android,not_removed,how is android wear better than apple watch for ios
Android,not_removed,yeah im actually really tempted
Android,not_removed,yes we are familiar with apples walled garden and as i said to ukirihuna if hypothetically samsung came up with an iphonecompatible smartwatch with better features than the apple watch a huge chunk of the apple watch buyers would not be swayed simply because its not an apple product
Android,not_removed,its not and even if it was what im trying to say is that a decent chunk of the apple watch buyers are heavily influenced by the fact its an apple product and a look at functionalityspecs comes second
Android,not_removed,i have the att model and i love it it can be bought cheap these days too the latest update brought all the features except the new aod aod is huge battery drain anyway so not much lost
Android,not_removed,i went to the local best buy and was wowed by them very nice just got my lg yesterday but may still get the hah
Android,not_removed,which state are you in and when you say all colors do you mean black silver and gray or are you including the international colors as well
Android,not_removed,the arctic silver is really nice
Android,not_removed,california and yes us colors are displayed which are midnight black orchid gray and artic silver check them out bixby is also demo ready

Android,not_removed,its just so strange that a company with so much data and such a strong market share cant avoid getting caught up in their own bubble its not like they havent ever faced problems with launching a messaging platform and getting it to stick
Android,not_removed,everyone they added more stickers what else do you want
Android,not_removed,im a huge fan of google and their previous products but really getting annoyed with their product strategies as of late fragmentation was one of the core issues they were to tackle with android and it seems they made some progress with that meanwhile they continue to deprecate products that already work well and release half baked new products in place honestly what was wrong with google talk then release hangouts with yay sms integration only to remove it again now looks like hangouts will die only to be replaced by allo and duo what is wrong with gmail that they needed to make inbox why not add features to an existing refined product gmail rather than try to create buzz with new products like inbox the first one of these moves they made was google reader and they have just continually aggravated me by closing old products and making new nearly identical but half baked products where is the cohesion seems like google has grown to the point where theyve lost touch of what the user actually wants individuals create amazing buzzworthy products that users dont care about strictly to look good
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,if only this wasnt stupidly obvious i still refuse to invite anyone to allo because you can reach me on hangouts or email or whatsapp or sms or basically any communication service from any device but not allo trust google though the important thing is to get messaging right first then add features rolls eyes
Android,not_removed,you mean an app thats only notable feature was a watered down version of google assistant from the pixel color me surprised
Android,not_removed,i dont use it simply because it advertises itself to non allo users very unprofessional
Android,not_removed,good hopefully it fails miserably so they refocus on hangouts or messenger with rcs
Android,not_removed,no sms support and none of my friends know or care that it exist made it pointless to keep on my phone
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it and never used it literally two of my contacts have it it offered nothing of value me i have a pixel and couldnt care less about assistant caveat im on project fi and very much appreciating hangouts integration it is everything i could want in a communication service hangouts is established and multiplatform you can use it straight from a web browser smsmms from anywhere voice and video calls though to be honest i found duo to be more reliable and consistent with video quality but hangouts was perfectly satisfactory
Android,not_removed,thats probably because people are finally starting to realize googles way of doing things every time they release an app it seems everyone loves it and they support it all the way up until its basically bug free and move on to something new long time google fan but its gotten annoying over the years
Android,not_removed,those million people that have downloaded it dont want to annoy the million people in their contacts with a text message to download an app so they can text them its fucking bonkers you cant send an actual text with the app
Android,not_removed,allo was last updated on the app store around weeks ago in that time it has received new user ratings holy shit i didnt realise it was that bad i just looked at it on my app store belgium and allo doesnt show any reviews for any version because we have not received enough ratings to display an average
Android,not_removed,im downloading itwhen they add sms support
Android,not_removed,shit this just reminded me i need to uninstall it
Android,not_removed,allo is there anybody in there just nod if you can duo meis there anyone home
Android,not_removed,you could publish an app that was literally a piece of poop and people would download it just to see how poopy it really was then uninstall it and tell their friends it was crap
Android,not_removed,you know what google needs another messaging app
Android,not_removed,because it doesnt do anything people want but being a google app means millions just based on googles audience will download it people dont often appreciate the significance of a brand and market share uber could launch ridesharing on bicycles tomorrow and assuredly a million people will try it
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it found out it didnt sync across devices and had no desktop client then deleted it and went back to hangouts i dont know what im gonna do ifwhen they drop support for hangouts google voice probably use a bunch of third party crap and yell about the olden days when quarters used to only cost a nickel
Android,not_removed,i started using signal after i read up on allo thats the only good that came out of this misery
Android,not_removed,they need to pivot like pied piper
Android,not_removed,its nice but whatsapp has text voice and video all in one app im a google fan but whatsapp won that battle
Android,not_removed,i was one of the million noticed there was no sms integration deleted it
Android,not_removed,still no web based app no multi device support no sms doa
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it and sent a message to two friends they replied what the hell is this just send a regular text message they said they couldnt see who else is on the conversation and the image i tried to send didnt get delivered to them they wont install it because they arent going to try to convince everyone they know to install it dead in the water
Android,not_removed,well no shit the app is absolutely useless when compared to the likes of facebook messenger or whatsapp
Android,not_removed,its pied piper all over again someone call bernice
Android,not_removed,im back on hangouts since maybe an update fixed the crashes
Android,not_removed,allo more like goodbye
Android,not_removed,and i am sitting here wondering what allo is while i use hangouts
Android,not_removed,the biggest allo problem was not having an desktop version and it was a shoot in the foot
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it when it came out opened it once and have not used it since what is allo for again
Android,not_removed,because duh it should have just been hangouts app updates no one is the wiser google is moronic with how they fragment themselves
Android,not_removed,google allo also hit million uninstalls in next days
Android,not_removed,thats because everyone is still using hangouts why didnt they just add all that functionality into hangouts
Android,not_removed,it doesnt do sms i use hangouts to message and smsmms my friendsfamily from all of my devices why the hell would i lock myself into this one messaging platform
Android,not_removed,mostly because people who would use it probably use whatsapp already
Android,not_removed,i think google is having a hard time focusing i honestly dont think we needed a new app hangouts was doing just fine if you have a google phone you have hangouts messenger and now you can get allo or duo while i am not an apple fan one thing i can say is that they give you facetime and imessage and thats it they dont add a myriad of products that do the same thing while keeping the original alive google should release allo and have a eol for hangouts if they want allo to work this would be similar to what they did with google talk relative to hangouts originally
Android,not_removed,but people here said stickers were going to make it super duper popular
Android,not_removed,gee isnt that surprising
Android,not_removed,another half ass product that should have been intergrated into messenger instead was made a stand alone product and as such will suffer personally i feel duo and allo should be integrated into messenger as well as a few features from hangouts make it a complete app and then just kill off the rest and have one app to rule them all
Android,not_removed,i wonder why s
Android,not_removed,this is what google always seems to do they release a clone of an app that already exists and is already popular therefore nobody really needs or was clamoring for anyhow then they give it a really weird unintuitive name ensuring its obscurity
Android,not_removed,thats what you get for trying to enter an already oversaturated market everyone i know already uses whatsapp there have been many times where people went fuck whatsapp ill use x from now on and every single one of those persons still uses whatsapp simply because everyone uses whatsapp i couldnt switch away from whatsapp even if i wanted to because it would mean giving up messaging with almost everyone i know
Android,not_removed,good let it die fast so google can move on the last thing we need is years of watching it wither on the vine like google
Android,not_removed,allo seems dumb im having no problems and nothing but good things with hangouts there is no reason for me to use something else and try to convince everyone to also use it
Android,not_removed,allo hell no
Android,not_removed,two days later its momentum seemed utterly stalled ftfy
Android,not_removed,installs say nothing about use the one person i knew had it switched to an iphone last month
Android,not_removed,i still use hangouts with my google voice number but when i installed allo i had a grand total of contacts on it deleted it soon after
Android,not_removed,cause for the life of me i cant find a fucking purpose for it all my friends are on facebook messenger it was like google and play music i already had services for that stuff that worked just fine why switch
Android,not_removed,cant run allo without a phone number why cant i run allo on my nexus killed it for me right there
Android,not_removed,i really think they dont care anymore if they do care they have been done this right they has more things to be concern
Android,not_removed,im actually curious if anyone at google thought this was going succeed this was gonna be a failure before it was even released
Android,not_removed,i had allo for about minutes
Android,not_removed,i recently uninstalled it sat on my device for a few months none of my contacts were using it
Android,not_removed,allo is googles attempt to replicate their success in the social world with orkut buzz google by replacing google talk wave hangouts
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,google screws up a messaging client who could have predicted that
Android,not_removed,ok people one last time lets get this straight downloads use
Android,not_removed,because its shiiiiiiit
Android,not_removed,my girlfriend and i have tried our best to use it theres stuff to like about it but we almost never get notifications from it so only find out the other has messaged by opening the app utterly useless
Android,not_removed,i was all excited to download it last night then whatno sms whats this for
Android,not_removed,just use signal
Android,not_removed,literally no one outside of the us want to use a new chat app no offense
Android,not_removed,hangouts still works ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,creating a new messaging client when you already have one and not using the userbase from the first in your new app seems bizarre to me
Android,not_removed,if only they had an existing messaging app which they could have just as easily turned into allo under the hood but kept calling it hangouts if only
Android,not_removed,fuck allo ive been using hangouts since it was released and was very happy when they implemented sms integration but it feels like theyre slowly moving away from hangouts and towards allo and duo which makes no sense because i feel like it further fragments the population and moved focus away from an already great messaging app
Android,not_removed,allo sucks u cant even pixelate or draw messages
Android,not_removed,google is pretty horrible at marketing some great products take g for example my feed provides me with so much better content than twitter or facebook lol but most of my friends havent made the switchso i am running more services i can see why a lot of people dont want yet another social network even if its design is better once youve been with one for a few years switching is tough funny enough a ton of my friends give you a blank stare if you mention g and they dont even know what it isgreat marketing google
Android,not_removed,partially because they have three messaging apps and with fi i have to use hangouts
Android,not_removed,its so weird about sms if i could replace my sms app id use it
Android,not_removed,i never thought i would say this being early adopter on everything google and android to the point of being antiapple but i have been considering to just give up give up on google google allo may be the prime example of what google thinks of his own products and frankly i am getting tired of being the guinea pig or tester for all google products its tiring disappointing and frustrating they are making apple look good
Android,not_removed,honestly at this point if its a google messaging or communication app i wont install it theyve cocked up so often ive become cynical
Android,not_removed,this is absolutely shocking fucking news i tell you what
Android,not_removed,from someone with product marketing strategy background im bewildered by the lack of a clear strategy behind googles messaging platforms so much fragmentation so little direction and cohesion what google needs to do imho or if i ever was the im product manager would be massive consolidation but not at the expense of the user interface design in fact design usability should be king how about a single messaging app with all of the following multidevice support message backup support for alternate and even competing protocols sms jabber co wechat to name a few hell even fb messenger web client desktop client chatbotpersonal assistant support integration with your email tasks calendars voice support which actually works and does something useful think sirialexagooglenow with superclever ai that really understands the context of your life to understand automate tasks i think the ai integration would be super useful think of a few use cases text mom tell her im gonna be mins late remind me to video chat with the kids at whens the next flight to paris and what is the cost order pizza some beer for a party of delivery by at my house goes without saying it should be as friendly to use as whatsapp and other bestofthebreed modern clients to start with no bs account to create just use your google one or your telephone number in case youve declined or never created an account with them then while browsing your contacts list or when going back to an ongoing conversation show you whos online now or when was the last time they were like the checkmarks on whatsapp which turn blue once your contact has actually read your message so you know they did allow for seamless integration of features from within the app photos videos files attachment location sharing services incl realtime if part has agreed to it eg where are you dude check me out ill be there in mkaytrackingall is good allow for simple sharing of web stuff ie browse share save for later annotate web pages right from within the app and add collaborative features like whats possible in some of their other collaboration apps like keep realtime shopping lists which can be updated by all involved is a huge hit in my house
Android,not_removed,a deal breaker for me was that it cant be the default sms and it constantly invites those who dont use it its annoying
Android,not_removed,why didnt they just focus on improving hangouts i love hangouts and still use it why would i want to switch from one app to twothree with less functionality
Android,not_removed,big surprise we dont need another useless proprietary messaging system that has no advantages over the dozens of them already in existence
Android,not_removed,it will stay that way until they implement sms
Android,not_removed,that would be because literally no one i know uses it
Android,not_removed,im not going to use a google messaging product that doesnt work in the browser via gmailinbox its really that simple i use hangouts all day every day from both my phone and my desktop to chat with people who are either on their phone or on their desktop if allo replaces hangouts in that fashion ill gladly switch
Android,not_removed,im keen to use it for assistant but i dont need another messaging app make it a texting app and ill happily try it
Android,not_removed,i tried to get my friends using this but kept hearing the same responses about how they already have multiple chat apps installed eg messenger whatsapp and how they dont want to use more i think weve reached a pretty big problem where some only use one of these types of apps and people are getting frustrated with having to install and use so many different chat apps
Android,not_removed,weird i didnt want to download a brand new messaging app amidst all my current messaging apps that would also send all my friends a separate alert that they need to download a new messaging app in order to communicate with me
Android,not_removed,lets be honest here people no excuses allo could be like imessage if google wanted it that way they dont want it that way it has nothing to do with how difficult it is or whatnot allo could easily have sms integrated it doesnt because google wanted it that way stop making excuses for google pushing a crappy repetitive app small wannabe developers can make a better app than google did with allo allo is just a show and tell for their google assistant
Android,not_removed,i was really looking forward to allo the number reason why i dont use is is no dark theme why on earth would i choose to use a product with a white background i have accepted the fact that developers hate humans and thus make white backgrounds that are bad for vision its a sad truth and proves to me that the devil is real so no i wont be using allo if i can avoid it
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it realized that it cant do sms and promptly deleted it
Android,not_removed,i downloaded and uninstalled allo within minutes when it first came out duo on the otherhand i still use it to this day i was able to video chat while driving on phone is on a mount and it was pretty damn clear
Android,not_removed,i think the failure of this app was one of the reasons that led to me switching back to the iphone seriously lost faith in google and the direction theyre taking cant wait till note next year
Android,not_removed,id hope that this would make google improve hangouts or at least give it some care but we know thats a list cause expect yet another messaging solution next year that is incompatible with everything
Android,not_removed,you look at the lake
Android,not_removed,i absolutely love allo i didnt expect it to be the messaging app to end all messaging apps and this sub hyped it up way too much
Android,not_removed,i could see allo working out if they make google contacts awesome so i dont open allo or duo or messenger or hangouts i open the contact and say what kind of message i want to send them and see recent chat history unified in the contacts app then it would make sense in that case i can see the unix philosophy of many tiny apps each with a distinct refined purpose working but google contacts is not awesome ive seen awesome contacts apps before windows phone had a great one and google contacts isnt it
Android,not_removed,the minute theres true sms instead of the relay method used now ill be all over it
Android,not_removed,how has no one mentioned signal yet open source sms support clients for both ios and android encryption and even encrypted calling probable more that i have forgotten might not be imessage but it is definitely better than messages and allo
Android,not_removed,literally all i want is android imessage its all anyone wants i had hopes with hangouts but it was no longer supported and no one i knew had it
Android,not_removed,stop trying to make allo happen its not gonna happen
Android,not_removed,the pokémon go effect
Android,not_removed,two months and its still the same comments in every allo thread mine as well copy save and paste into new threads to rake in the sweet comment karma
Android,not_removed,the worst part of all of this is it is clear as day that they absolutely do not get it they arent seeing this sub they arent realizing they are becoming a joke i guarantee they think this app is awesome
Android,not_removed,its the richard hendricks conundrum
Android,not_removed,in other news the sky is in fact blue
Android,not_removed,after downloading it i dont get why i should use it over facebook messenger or even the default messenger app on my phone i want to like allo but it feels pointless in my day to day
Android,not_removed,same old story everyone makes a fuss over yet another bs messaging app only to find it really isnt all that great
Android,not_removed,dear google keep it simple stupid
Android,not_removed,i just have allo to play solitaire
Android,not_removed,i still have allo because it gives me access to google assistant thats literally the only reason
Android,not_removed,imessage baby
Android,not_removed,ive been on iphone for a couple years cause of fragmentation and updates and battery life but im curious what messaging app comes preloaded on the phone like which app do all my friends have or might some have a different one
Android,not_removed,my room mate convinced me to download it last week so far it hasnt made any significant improvements for me as far as texting but it is fun
Android,not_removed,i heard of this but i have no what it is chat thing i use hangout with a few people thats sufficient
Android,not_removed,and eventually google will replace allo with something else because its the way of the google the company is schizophrenic and have been for a long time i think they just have a lot of little fiefdoms and work in a bay area sized bubbleapple reminds me of this as well under cook flagship phone and flagship laptop dont use the same connector which feels like mac teams and iphone teams arent on the same page and they think they know better than all their users but when they only look internally of course it all looks good when the users probably just want one single simple messaging app then yet another new one fwiw i uninstalled allo a couple weeks ago because i didnt know anyone that used it even other android users
Android,not_removed,they realised its a piece of shit and other messaging apps do it better
Android,not_removed,ruddock speaks as though people actually review apps on the ios app store
Android,not_removed,knowing how people actually use allo this is probably million pairs people who used it a few times to chat with one other person
Android,not_removed,if only they put this out before whatsapp then it would have stuck its tough to get people to move now
Android,not_removed,man i use allo everyday i really love it
Android,not_removed,i only use allo for the assistant which is pretty cool i dont need a zillion messaging apps what happened to good old fashioned texting if i have someones phone number ill text them if not theyre probably on facebook if not only then youd need another messaging app but then you have to coordinate and see which one theyre on and make sure you have it at which point its easier to just ask them their phone number admittedly you need a messaging app if youre talking to someone who lives abroad especially in a country where facebook is blocked but other than that there are dozens of different apps and some of them seem cool but i cant figure out why i would need one all i need is a good free sms app google messenger is decent without any superfluous features without ads
Android,not_removed,really ive been using allo a ton my friends and i were just talking about in on google wave
Android,not_removed,im still using it anyone else i only have contact in allo so its quite convenient no scrolling and finding
Android,not_removed,i thought it was pretty cool got a few of my friends to download it one of them didnt receive my text so he uninstalled it i uninstalled it when i couldnt send an image to someone without allo i just feel like they should have just released it like they did google plus and they shouldnt have released a social network the way they did
Android,not_removed,still use it and i like it quite a lot
Android,not_removed,i was so excited when allo was first introduced mainly for the assistant integration now the only reason i still have it installed on my phone is because of some stubborn chap who insists on not using whatsapp or hangouts i cant afford to cut him off though hes chill
Android,not_removed,the only reason i use allo is so i can text us friends from europe that way they dont need another app
Android,not_removed,what is allo
Android,not_removed,google entered the market quite late it should have launched it three years back
Android,not_removed,google you cant make messaging apps you cant make social networks please stop
Android,not_removed,how the fuck is this news worthy
Android,not_removed,got it to see what it was like no sms no desktop chat no multi device sign in no one else using it i think ill stick with hangouts whatsapp and sms for now
Android,not_removed,when the app needed my periodic contact list i decided to stop installing it you dont need to know this unless i add a contact to the app its a fail for me
Android,not_removed,nobody i know is using it so whats the point
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it but stopped trying to use it because its a messaging platform without sms capabilities even facebook messenger has sms
Android,not_removed,would be nice if the article explained what the hell it is and why i should care if ive never heard of it before now it cant be very important to my life
Android,not_removed,easy its because in days didnt happen at the first place
Android,not_removed,hangouts was just fine until google started fixing things that werent broken there was no need for allo
Android,not_removed,thanks for reminding me i have this installed completely forgot about it unsurprisingly
Android,not_removed,why would i want to use this app
Android,not_removed,as someone who has no idea what allo is was disappointed they did not explain it once in the article
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it a while back and didnt see how it was any better than normal texting
Android,not_removed,did we really need another messaging app
Android,not_removed,shocking if only we had some way of expecting this from a recent google product like millions of people screaming it in unison on the internet and lolling at their terrible ability to buildmarketsort of maybe beta but also maybe notnot live alongside another rather similar app that hasnt even worked yet either calling it now google will release the google search engine app next it will be limited in its ability to search for the moment and doesnt support images news or any other google service we will all continue to use google however we fucking used it before like the google app
Android,not_removed,not default no decent sms support any idiot could see this wouldnt go anywhere fast
Android,not_removed,needs a microphone widget
Android,not_removed,smallest dudumtss in the history of humanity
Android,not_removed,just make allo more like old hangouts and theyll get their downloads
Android,not_removed,allo the lotus notes of mobile communication
Android,not_removed,with a name like that im not surprised
Android,not_removed,you know what google needs a messenger app that converts voice into text which will be converted back to voice by the receiving side
Android,not_removed,in the midst of increasing frustration with all this divergence of function not just from google but from everyone can anyone explain why do i need anything more advanced than plain old sms when it comes to textbased conversation why i need anything more advanced than a plain old imap protocol when it comes to email seriously chat hangouts whatsapp imessenger etc can blow me i dont want three different apps for different groups of friends similarly labels can blow me i dont see why the email rules ive been using for are not better
Android,not_removed,quite surprising
Android,not_removed,yeah cause in five days everyone realized it sucks
Android,not_removed,i still cant figure out the need for allo
Android,not_removed,its basically useless as a messaging platform at the moment since it does weird shit with the sms messages it sends and theres no webdesktop client for instant message ala hangouts i still have it for the assistant functionality but i dont use it since i just do the ok google thing in my search bar basically the only thing i use it for now is having it send me dad jokes a couple times a day and sending me weather forecasts etc yet another case of zomg this is gonna be cool falling flat
Android,not_removed,installed and never used i know very few people with android and fewer still i text with so without sms intergration i dont have any use for a messaging app i dont know what google is doing but its not working
Android,not_removed,i cant use it to message nonallo friends because it sends that irritating you should download allo message thus i dont use it hardly ever
Android,not_removed,after having it from launch until about a month ago the only other people i knew that had it was my dad and my wife i made my wife delete allo and install whatsapp im in the us btw as a lot of my other friends use that as well i just went back to sms with my dad
Android,not_removed,its utter trash the only way this was going to work was with sms fallback id love to see how many people are still active out of that five million changing messaging apps is a slow and tedious process as other people slowly start using it this was doomed from the start
Android,not_removed,the problem is it doesnt support sms properly and keeps wanting to send that fucking text about downloading it hangouts is what allo should have been with the fun additions all i wanted was imessenger for android basically
Android,not_removed,and messaging is still fragmented as ever what is the end game here its not even worthy of a download from me because im not going to ask iphone friends x y and z to download allo when they have a perfectly capable messenger app in imessage if your app doesnt support sms its pretty much useless to me from a messaging standpoint
Android,not_removed,they shouldve just made whatever changes they felt were necessary to hangouts there isnt a single compelling reason to use allo
Android,not_removed,those million are android fanboys
Android,not_removed,no surprise here google creates another service that becomes a barren desert i like the look and feel of allo but thats where my liking stops theres too much missing from the app for it to take off now thats its borderline dead id be surprised if they could pull it back above the ground
Android,not_removed,i really wish the play store showed how many installs there are instead of downloads i dont care if a app is downloaded times if of the people uninstall it in the first day not related to allo in any way just ranting
Android,not_removed,and meanwhile if you want simple improvements to something like messenger like custom notification per contact youre never going to see it
Android,not_removed,i still dont get what all and duo are really two separate messaging apps whats so great about that textra works fine for me so why bother using two apps when i have one that does both minus the facetime stuff which i dont do nor have i ever done with anyone
Android,not_removed,deleted it right away i was promised sms integration a la imessenger but all i got was all my friends saying whats up with your messages theyre not from your number and all my new texts not coming in through allo because it couldnt even be set as default messaging app i would figure google would work out major usability issues like this before releasing and hyping up a product
Android,not_removed,everyone toyed with google assistant then deleted the app because who the hell needs yet another smsmms app that only works with other people that have the same app just trying to ape imessage or whatsapp isnt going to get this community fired up
Android,not_removed,but but but nobody ever uses sms everyone told me
Android,not_removed,i really wish i knew what google was thinking with allo even with the ai integration which is not even as good as it should be its still very lack luster its basically a bare bones im app why would they release an unfinished product im assuming that they have plans to improve it but how long is that going to take im trying to see what the grand plan is here but im getting nothing
Android,not_removed,i think google wave might have been more useful than allo
Android,not_removed,i have no idea what any of these apps do but theyre all related to chat i presume its already a mature market i have whatsapp as my go to for messaging with facebook messenger to keep up with people who i dont have a number for google has too many chatmessaging apps and i have no idea which does what and i cant be bothered to learn since what i have already does what i want google is derping hard in my opinion
Android,not_removed,what separates allo from other messaging apps ive got it installed but i dont know why id use it over messenger whatsapp
Android,not_removed,the obvious reason is that why use allo when we have texting and whatsapp this should so obvious imessage incorporates both the whatsapp and texting features all in one therefore its used if they would allow texting through allo it would be used at least thats why i dont use it the assistant feature in allo is basically useless because i use ok google i dont see the point of allo
Android,not_removed,i thought things will change finally with sundar at the helm
Android,not_removed,its almost like all of the people that wanted to download it downloaded it what are they going to do download it again
Android,not_removed,the simple answer here as far as i can tell is that allo simply doesnt do anything better than the alternatives why should i switch from platform abc or xyz when my friends are already using those and allo doesnt offer a compelling reason to switch
Android,not_removed,doesnt this happen with just about every google product its so frustrating when they buy some small startup only to kill the product a few months later
Android,not_removed,this app alone had so much promise if it had sms like of users asked for i would be happy in staying with my android phone google doesnt give a shit about you and what you think
Android,not_removed,its sms or nuthin
Android,not_removed,i feel like the problem is noone wants to talk to each others faces any more they like the distance the phone affords i think allo is awesome but i can only ever get a few people to download it and fewer use it more than once if noone is on it i cant use it so it get lost on the people thag want to use it and dont want to
Android,not_removed,i cant install allo or duo on my tablet making wire and telegram even more superior
Android,not_removed,allo is great for my daily dad jokes
Android,not_removed,yeah because its shit
Android,not_removed,im wondering what happened to google rewards it was always wanting me to fill something out i got a new phone and now its dead
Android,not_removed,meh until their is a desktop app i have no reason to ever use the app or even install it not a single person i know uses it and i work in a heavy ittech place with a majority of people using android
Android,not_removed,because the guy in charge is out of touch and super arrogant hopefully they fire him
Android,not_removed,some of the android developers were doing an ama about a year ago and i asked them why the libraries and style guides for material design were so nonexistent their response was roughly what are you talking about my friend wrote this library here is his github page they really truly live in their own ecosystem its the kind of accusation i might have lobbed at apple once upon a time actually i still would as an osx user im mostly a ruby developer by day so i am really actually familiar with the github page and source code as documentation phenomenon but thats not how the android dev community works half the android developers on the market are repurposed java enterprise developers
Android,not_removed,the just need to pick one for gods sake
Android,not_removed,yeah thats what the stickers are for
Android,not_removed,also five million downloads in five days means fuck all when you install the app at the factory then have it auto update as soon as the user signs into their google account thats like herding a thousand people into prison cells then saying a thousand people choose to stay in prison
Android,not_removed,back in the day google was data driven it rocked then design became the cool new buzzword in silicon valley fair enough design is hella important the problem with that is that designers started to have a final say in things and instead of data they listened to some design guru who thought he could predict the future design something cool looking and understand the customer all at once cant say thats going too well in most cases source went to design school
Android,not_removed,whats google allo
Android,not_removed,v now with more stickers
Android,not_removed,integration with sms like hangouts i want to talk to all my friends without having to use five different apps even it means disabling certain features for certain messages
Android,not_removed,i want them to release those stickers with an open source keyboard that i can use in an app that i actually use im a dreamer
Android,not_removed,desktop client better link previews editing messages after sending and so on heck allo cant even reliably push messages to the phone point is once a messenging service is entrenched it wins no matter how good the competition becomes telegram shits over whatsapp in terms of features but its userbase is still not much also imo alloduo should have been one app
Android,not_removed,i just dont fucking understand hangouts had video and texting and it was on all platforms and clients using it in the browser is huge what were they trying to accomplish with allo and duo it cant compete with imessage if it doesnt have a desktop client
Android,not_removed,the first one of these moves they made was google reader and they have just continually aggravated me by closing old products and making new nearly identical but half baked products were it so rosy they killed google reader one of their products i loved the most and replaced it with nothing that was even baked at all there was no chance in hell i was going to migrate to using google to keep up on my news ive said it before whatever bean counters at google made the call to kill those beloved products around that time in order to save a few bucks i hope they took into account how much it cost them in goodwill its been years now and i still dont look at google the same way anymore i used to be an early adopting evangelist now allo daydream ill consider trying them if and only if they hit critical mass daydream in particular has google tv or google home written all over it some project theyre going to have a dalliance with before dumping for google vr or google or jollo or whatever
Android,not_removed,theres a semijoke about google being a bunch of engineers in search of a manager sometimes when i see their product decisions i think theres some truth to it its like theyre institutionally incapable of maintaining software and just keep doing greenfield development instead which is doubtless more fun but pretty shitty if youre a customer and would prefer incremental improvements
Android,not_removed,hangouts is awesome and i will continue to use it as long as i can i have an alternative number through google voice sms mms and set up my prepaid voicemail service through google so i can see voicemail through hangouts allo was just an incomplete and dumb idea
Android,not_removed,reader was the first big mistake it was a working social network on its own with share and friends and could be grown into the good product for the masses with the right push at least i still have feedly
Android,not_removed,i actually stopped reading a bunch of blogs that i liked because of the end of reader i simply forgot about them
Android,not_removed,you had me up until inbox its the best and im never going back
Android,not_removed,its funny how i saw windows phone users bitch about what which was a bit crazy at one point but at least its not as i simply cannot recommend any google services anymore simply because i have no idea whether they will still exist in a couple of years time
Android,not_removed,i would think the problem with google is that they have too many employees that are trying to stay relevant so we get this incoherent eco system that dies and reborn
Android,not_removed,i agree on everything except inbox its fantastic
Android,not_removed,what is wrong with gmail that they needed to make inbox if gmail had a snooze function i would go back
Android,not_removed,hangouts isnt going anywhere yet and it still has sms integration
Android,not_removed,buzzworthy products anyone remember httpsenmwikipediaorgwikigooglebuzz
Android,not_removed,its like they dont have a master overall product management team or something i dont understand how they have so many different products that arent integrated at all i understand it with companies google acquires though
Android,not_removed,when you promote a culture of innovation for innovation sake dont be surprised that this happens on college applications it looks better to start your own club than maintain an existing one so clubs die and new ones show up but nothing of import gets donr because it always takes a while to get big projects going by that time the founder is on their way to a fantastic college and thr freshman wants to do the same so time to start a new club google is full of ambitious people who need to constantly demonstrate that they are innovating it looks better on a resume to say you started a new product or a startup doesnt matter what you killed to do it its all literally retarding
Android,not_removed,i must have not gotten the hangouts update on i still use hangouts for sms dont think of inbox and gmail as separate think of inbox as a simple gmail dashboard
Android,not_removed,not to mention incompetence with their existing products ex youtube your right they have lost touch with what the user actually wants
Android,not_removed,yay sms integration only to remove it again except that they did it ohsovery wrong it should have been like imessage or signal but instead was some other monstrosity
Android,not_removed,i loved reader feedly is fine tho
Android,not_removed,dont worry apple is fucking their own shit up as well spoke as a die hard apple fan
Android,not_removed,exactly readers shutdown was the point i decided to move away from relying on google products and started recommending my friends and family do the same even though reader was a niche product it was used by every good techie and influencer i knew a shortsighted decision on their behalf
Android,not_removed,this is why i havent switched to fi yet i have no interest in risking my google voice account right now because they are not a company interested in longterm incremental improvement like a software company should they overturn the apple cart just to pretend like they have something for pr announcements
Android,not_removed,you joke but give it years
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,ive spent a lot of time getting everyone i know on hangouts im not doing that again with allo when theres no meaningful reason to
Android,not_removed,i kept duo i threw out allo
Android,not_removed,same here whatsapp hangouts telegram take your pick allo is so far behind i wouldnt look at it even once if i could undo the one look i took
Android,not_removed,i sent message and realized it was not necessary
Android,not_removed,huh none of my friends want to use this said about million people
Android,not_removed,people are genuinely not interested there is whatsapp and messenger so no one cares about allo i tried it and liked it a bit and told my friends about it and they just did not care
Android,not_removed,i downloaded it to check it out found it didnt receive hangouts messages nor do anything that i couldnt do with hangouts if ive already convinced my friends to use hangouts i couldnt see any feature in allo that would make me want to change i imagine lots of people are using imessage facebook messenger line whatsapp groupme or a dozen others and dont need another one
Android,not_removed,ive been using allo since day with multiple people still using it today it isnt trash but theres no reason to switch to it from any other service that already has the market share assistant is kinda neat but the way its implemented its half baked and feels like allo was made just to show off some basic functions of the assistant and machine learning maybe even use the users it does gain to harvest data and further the progress its better and worse than hangouts pick and choose i keep seeing the argument that hangouts is better but for years people complained about how bad the hangouts app was and it really was and its still sort of busted allo will never get sms even if it did there wouldnt be a point none of the allo features would work over sms it will probably carry on for a couple years and other become neglected or itll be shut down
Android,not_removed,unprofessional and annoying as fuck i wish all companies would stop doing that sent from my iphone
Android,not_removed,advertises where i havent seen any other than the promo videos
Android,not_removed,ideally theyd take the good things from allo and put them into hangouts leverage the relatively strong userbase you already have and if they dont ruin it haha itll work out fine
Android,not_removed,well they never said theyd stop working on those two apps if anything they said theyd put hangouts as more focused in enterprise and messenger is definitely getting love with rcs allo is basically on its deathbed given that its only useful feature is assistant and eventually everyone will have access to assistant may take years but still
Android,not_removed,google social networks in a nutshell
Android,not_removed,same all i really care about is whether i can send texts from my computer and hangouts via fi is the only official way i can do that
Android,not_removed,yup i have basically lost trust in google
Android,not_removed,i wonder if the pixel will be like this i dont know a lot about google or the pixel
Android,not_removed,this is one of the things i appreciate about signal ive been using it as my mainonly sms app for a year now i can send sms to everybody and encrypted messages over data with anyone who also also has the app very elegant i just wish they hadnt dropped encrypted sms the fork silence has maintained it
Android,not_removed,it is mindblowing you send what looks like spam to people if they arent using allo in what fucking world did they think this was acceptable
Android,not_removed,irc
Android,not_removed,whatsapp won the race at least in europe everyone uses it here
Android,not_removed,their team lead has already publicly and officially said allo wont get sms unless hes lying and risking any credibility he may have already had allo will never get sms and if it ever did itd be too little too late
Android,not_removed,its kinda silly i have allo hangouts and google messenger installed would it kill them to integrate them into one app
Android,not_removed,i already have sms support on every single device i use with hangouts why the hell would i want a messaging app that only works on this one phone blows my mind
Android,not_removed,exactly sms support some backup option
Android,not_removed,if they ever do that id think about switching back to android from ios imessage is the biggest thing keeping me from switching
Android,not_removed,common now i hear you uninstallingoww
Android,not_removed,i also started using signal great app
Android,not_removed,i noticed not only that but its a closed sandbox even from hangouts messages fuck right off i dont need yet another walled garden
Android,not_removed,exactly i dont see this complaint nearly enough i still use hangouts because it is seamless across my phone desktop and chromebook when im sitting at my desk working on something for hours and people start messaging me i dont want to have to stop what im doing and pick up my fucking phone every seconds i like allo but that was a dealbreaker right from the start
Android,not_removed,that baffles my mind as well all these smart people being hired at google and none of them know a thing about messaging
Android,not_removed,for taking screenshots of witty google assistant responses
Android,not_removed,what nobody said that here there were like threads about it being doa
Android,not_removed,but stickers s
Android,not_removed,its mind boggling that google still exists i clicked through a link to it thru my rss feed and saw it looked very different than my last visit easily i thought boy i cant believe they are still working on this forgot what i was there for and closed the tab
Android,not_removed,watching it wither on the vine ftfy watching it wither on the like vine
Android,not_removed,wow i forced my wife to download it and she is the only one that has it installed we have sent two messages on it
Android,not_removed,for you need to type times
Android,not_removed,yeah you are right btw you are an awesome developer i love your app my moon phase pro
Android,not_removed,hangouts and i really only use that because of its sms integration i dont chat with many people and the ones i do i either use sms or skype part of that crowd if ms would integrate sms into skype id have no need to use anything else
Android,not_removed,can i be your second
Android,not_removed,saying that to the company who owns youtube 😁😁😁
Android,not_removed,textra
Android,not_removed,they just need to make an updated hangouts
Android,not_removed,you may not need it but smsmms is absolute garbage when it comes to anything other than straight character messages carriers and messaging clients handle larger messages differently so even longer strings of just text can be broken up or sent as one string depending on the mix involved thats not even going into things like end to end encryption animated gifs uncompressed photos or videos and read receipts to name just a few or even the total reliance on your carrier i cant send sms if im out of coverage area i get where youre coming from i used to feel the same way about plain text emails i mean why do you need to have html and images when it comes to a text conversation however those things have become the standard in communication so people have come to expect them
Android,not_removed,who is that
Android,not_removed,it has to be arrogance to ignore such glaring issues and to in fact push them as features it total hubris when that stops when the person whos really in charge says enough of this bullshit self deceiving self defeating game then the vast talent at google can actually be used to create something both competitive and onpoint google is far from alone though almost every company of a certain size ends up in this place youd think by now with all the business science knowledge we have that there could be very specific measures put in place to prevent this type of top level rot before it sets in
Android,not_removed,his responses on twitter would be hilarious if they werent so sad i mean this is the person that actually represents google sometime somewhere he had presented his vision to his peers and superiors and that got approved as a way forward nobody ever asked for what they delivered with allo literally never once in my life id seen someone anywhere both irl and on the internet say hey i wish there was an app that would be parsing my conversations with other people to occasionally suggest responses that i wouldnt have to type out how many times did people ask for a decent messaging app that would eliminate the need for countless party apps a billion probably but surely justin uberti knows best google also wasted such a perfect moment to hit the market with allo people were actually waiting for this app million downloads in days is no joke the whatsappfacebook data controversy would do wonders if google could make a point about allo being secure which is impossible without encryption that they had given up on and make people jump the ship but none of that happened months after all the hype had died they released a halfbaked product inferior to literally every other messaging app on the market lacking even the most basic functionality but hey there are stickers and you can play a game with the assistant
Android,not_removed,damn what subreddit was this ama in i would like to read these
Android,not_removed,some of the android developers were doing an ama about a year ago and i asked them why the libraries and style guides for material design were so nonexistent have you tried the httpsmaterialgooglecom or the httpsdeveloperandroidcomtopiclibrariessupportlibraryindexhtml these have definitely been around for more than a year android development has come a really long way and google is a big part of it they have invested a ton into the tools libraries training and documentation over the past or years
Android,not_removed,im mostly a ruby developer by day so i am really actually familiar with the github page and source code as documentation phenomenon almost no language is immune and i throw a temper tantrum when people at job try to pull that shit with me
Android,not_removed,choose one
Android,not_removed,i cannot upvote this enough stop forcing me to adopt a new app and by proxy forcing me to get others in my social circle on board too every year or so its ridiculous nonnerds are not interested in learning a new appnew way of doing things all the time youre pissing away your fucking mindshare at every turn here
Android,not_removed,recently came over to android two preinstalled messaging apps but neither of them look official wait there is a google messenger that looks good okay done and default and then today what is this google allo thing and then there is skype and facebook messenger with there we can do it all do you want us to pleeeeease let us i swear we wont screw it up attitude edit and i forgot about hangouts too
Android,not_removed,except when the app launched no devices had allo preinstalled
Android,not_removed,i am but probably not for the reason maximus google intended
Android,not_removed,mediocre
Android,not_removed,if my attitude stinks am i meant to change
Android,not_removed,v animated stickers
Android,not_removed,dont forget google voice integration
Android,not_removed,until sms is integrated ill stick with messenger
Android,not_removed,can someone please explain why this is so complicated say i have friends i want to get in contact with i text all five of them done what am i missing
Android,not_removed,telegram shits over whatsapp in terms of features but its userbase is still not much yes i communicate with only people over telegram everyone else is sms or whatsapp the telegram user experience is amazing regardless of what people think of its encryption methods their desktop client is equally amazing theyre bots and apiyou guessed itamazing i wish everyone would use it i would dump all other messaging apps in a heartbeat
Android,not_removed,oh but its coming soon™ they promise 🙂🔫
Android,not_removed,and they alloduo also require a sim cardphone number and can only be used on that device vs hangouts working on anything with a data connection
Android,not_removed,the same here i no longer going to try products just because they are made by google if they are good like photos ill use them but im not drinking the kool aid anymore reader and google notebook they killed this working product just to make keep a couple of years later were the first signs for me but this year choices were a real eye opener
Android,not_removed,rip google reader didnt find a suitable placement for my rss feeds and have abandoned using rss completely
Android,not_removed,i actively avoid their new products now even if i like them and start to use them chances are in a couple years theyll be deprecated and gone and them hyping them like they do keep and allo is a double red flag to me now
Android,not_removed,the problem for me as a user is i cant rely on a company that simply discontinues a product and leave me hanging for this very reason i decided to move away from google slowly i also heard stories of legit users getting locked out of their accounts and getting no help at all from support and that doesnt add to my confidence with the company at all the one thing i cant understand is why cant google properly transition users of one product to the new one surely theres some way to migrate data from say google talk to hangouts or even hangouts to duoallo in a way that users can simply start using the service they keep on building incompatible products without bothering with data migration at all which speaks on how they value us as users i wont say customers because were not
Android,not_removed,i used to be an early adopting evangelist same here i loved all things google back in the day lately not even close theyve lost touch with what made them great to begin with
Android,not_removed,ive said it before whatever bean counters at google made the call to kill those beloved products around that time in order to save a few bucks i hope they took into account how much it cost them in goodwill this a thousand times this i just dont even trust them anymore it feels like a dysfunctional relationship google needs to do trying to make fetch happen
Android,not_removed,nothing that was even baked at all they definitely had a buzz on
Android,not_removed,i know they are out there reading this i wonder what they think
Android,not_removed,your kill beloved products i agree with especially with the nexus line google doesnt seem to know what they want to do
Android,not_removed,well said im just now reaching this point ive been engrained in the google ecosystem for years and only furthered down the path when i bought my nexus im in the market for a new phone but no way am i forking over for a pixel the decisions theyve made are just puzzling the thought of having all my services under one umbrella was intriguing but the inconsistencies defeat the purpose the time for considering alternatives is long overdue
Android,not_removed,they killed google reader i dont even want to think about that i hate social bullshit but i made actual i met in real life even though they lived halfway across the globe friends trough that it was the only time i was actually matched with people that had my interests it was the only social network where i actually used the share button then they added bullshit twitter integrated it poorly killed reader killed retard twitter created the google minus thing and now they have nothing of value in that department i still use inoreader to follow some rss feeds that didnt die but the social aspect is just not the same if theres even one google nailed whatever algorithm they used to find out what you liked and which users you shared interests with
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,theres more than some truth to it think of all software engineering the talent that google has chances are a lot of those people arent going to find maintaining an existing large codebase to be exciting work everyone always wants to work on greenfield projects where they get to have a lot of impact instead of fixing bugs in someone elses code
Android,not_removed,maintenance is what makes the world workbut it isnt cool httpfreakonomicscompodcastinpraiseofmaintenance
Android,not_removed,i cut them some slack on allo because i figured they were just using it to introduce the assistant i only use it rarely for assistant
Android,not_removed,check out feedly it fills the void
Android,not_removed,newsblur
Android,not_removed,i didnt stop right away but so many of them died anyway that my inoreader account that imported all my rss feeds is basically a depressing graveyard
Android,not_removed,duo video quality is levels beyond hangouts levels beyond again they should take a few core features from hangouts then combine everything into messenger and make it the default messaging platform on android that would be the competitor to imessage we need and want
Android,not_removed,i get the feeling that management gets annoyed with key figures in these established products like gmail making too much money and brings on cheaper newbies to create better products drop the old guys making too much
Android,not_removed,dont get me wrong i use inbox but not the webapp and like it but why not just roll the new features into gmail rather than blow up the old
Android,not_removed,i thought so as well but when i realized how tethered and heavy the ux is to the app and chrome i went back to a simpler workflow with gmail that i could use everywhere
Android,not_removed,i kept trying to use inbox but no matter what i do it will never give me notifications for anything i missed a ton of emails that ended up in my main inbox and should have been notified ive switched back to gmail and everything works fine now
Android,not_removed,i use inbox too but its half baked at best want to add an imap account or change smtp settings go to gmail want to attach google drive files directly use gmail want to search through your hangout chat gmail want advanced search gmail formatting is gimped compared to gmail list goes on and it seems theyre adding those existing features at a snails pace if even at all i mean its been like over two years
Android,not_removed,the app is great the desktop experience is frustratingly slow sometimes though and i can see where hes coming from doing what take seconds in gmail can take ages in inbox while it folds and unfolds categories and bundles on a modern pc with a good processor not a pos i can run games in theres no excuse inbox put a little too much emphasize on design over speed and as a result is still a bit burdened by flourish rather than accented by it
Android,not_removed,inbox master race its so much better than regular gmail
Android,not_removed,thats the features i use most in inbox especially because i can snooze things to locations as well
Android,not_removed,wasnt that the one where they accidentally made everyones activity on the service public to everyone and wasnt it made worse because people were opted into it without realizing it
Android,not_removed,sorry maybe i said that wrong you can use it for sms but no more merged hangouts texting
Android,not_removed,ive spent a lot of time getting everyone i know on hangouts i did the same thing and then when duoallo was announced everyone switched to telegram no point struggling through another google chat migration
Android,not_removed,on this subject i really wish they integrated hangouts with phone numbers so i could automatically talk to people whos numbers i have in hangouts similar to whatsapp their whole strategy is baffling
Android,not_removed,wouldnt any app that can take and send pictures like most sms apps need camera access
Android,not_removed,why not hangouts it has an android client an iphone client a httpshangoutsgooglecom a httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailgooglehangoutsnckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapdhlen and its available in gmail what did you win by using allo
Android,not_removed,i wish i could just fucking unify everything and talk to everybody in one app like i could with pidgin back in the im days of aol and msn all of my canadian and northern american friends used msn messenger and all of my southerner friends used aol and i had a client that could just do everything by logging into different accounts thats what xmpp was doing google embraced it it helped gtalk become popular and then extinguished it by breaking it from xmpp you could see person online you could get messages yet they wont see what you wrote when they released hangouts same thing they did to usenet google is the microsoft of
Android,not_removed,like i could with pidgin back in the im days of aol and msn pidgin was just a single program that handled multiple protocols your friends were still fragmented across different services you just had a way of aggregating your access to those services for what its worth there are httpramboxpro and services out there that do the same thing however even something like rambox doesnt really do the same thing that pidgin did mostly because this is the inevitable result of companies turning towards proprietary closed protocols sure you can still use pidgin to connect to hangouts but facebook removed their xmpp connector and whatsapp and kik all have closedgarden style of operation and that works for their business models its incredibly frustrating
Android,not_removed,probably that and they needed a reason for people to download the app in the first place i bet a good chunk of that mil were people downloading it just to check out the assistant feature and uninstalled it shortly after
Android,not_removed,not just testing the assistant is an ad service the whole reason companies release proprietary messaging systems is to make money the most obvious way to make that money is to put ads into the app but if there were ads in a messaging app youd get pissed off and never use it right allo was supposed to solve that problem it was a complete pipe dream but they figured hey if we could make the ads look like a feature maybe people will want to use them
Android,not_removed,i cant stand it honestly this electronic message has been scanned for viruses and malware by avast
Android,not_removed,if someone sends you assuming you dont use allo but have an android device with the google play services installed a message via allowed you get a notification with the message and an option to reply and an option to install allo
Android,not_removed,if i send a text via allo to a colleague who does not have the app it will send an additional text to them saying something along the lines of hey download this new super cool app called allo and then give a link of my coworkers asked me if my phone had a virus that is when i uninstalled it
Android,not_removed,this is so obviously the right move its painful that they cant see outside of their own bubble
Android,not_removed,ideally theyd take the good things from allo and put them into hangouts so already done
Android,not_removed,rcs is not coming to allo
Android,not_removed,this is why i switched to apple
Android,not_removed,of course theyll do the same thing with the pixel they did it to the nexus brand and i dont think google is going to change their behavior any time soon as soon as the nexus brand really started to go mainstream they killed it and came out with the pixel not even a full year after the fantastic nexus and were released
Android,not_removed,where i remember him listing a bunch of feature requests including sms support and saying just listing commonly requested items to be cheeky
Android,not_removed,no they didnt he said a lot of the messaging apps didnt start with sms or still dont have sms he said that if imessage came to android it wouldnt have sms he also mentioned it was one of the top requested features among like
Android,not_removed,apparently yes
Android,not_removed,exactly and desktop support what are they thinking i dont understand why they would not just upgrade hangouts with new features
Android,not_removed,i want sms and a desktop client
Android,not_removed,i dont follow this nothing would change for you compared to now you would just be using allo for sms instead of messenger or textra since no one will be using allo for allo chats just like now and it would still not be compatible with imessage
Android,not_removed,yeah i dont know how it is in the us but in south america the first thing you do after you buy a new phone is install whatsapp its what made most people upgrade their phones i still see some folks rocking those old nokia flip phones tho
Android,not_removed,its the ones in charge that dont know shit
Android,not_removed,i read a lot of people in here talking about how stickers are super important in insert some market outside of north america and how is a killer feature
Android,not_removed,with the latest sticker updates some people were defending and saying stickers were really important
Android,not_removed,haha wasnt expecting that comment much appreciated im very grateful
Android,not_removed,saying it to the company that tried google wave and google buzz and then google
Android,not_removed,and the company that doesnt give a shit about youtube
Android,not_removed,true i do get that it does seem that there are a few requirements above stock legible text that would be nice to have although some would need to be clarified a great deal eg encryption is lovely i just absolutely do not trust google or facebook to manage these things gifs are nice but opens the door nicely for spam read receipts are nice but can l be convinced its not used for tracking purposes plus and even more importantly ubiquity every mobile device owned by everyone i know supports sms as standard we need a stock industry standard protocol not a walled garden mugging rather like xmpp if google hadnt decided to stop supporting it
Android,not_removed,justin uberti i think
Android,not_removed,its a textbook example of i dont use this feature sms so its not important
Android,not_removed,hes talking about the lack of support for anything fancier than a white cardview google doesnt give you anything to work with when it comes to animations how can you expect developers to waste their time adding the types of animations that you see instead of fixing bugs and adding new features to their products material design was a beacon of hope for designers and developers alike but the lack of support from google besides the bare minimum makes every app feel like theyre the same uninteresting concept being given a new coat of paint to go along with the different name no fab animations no cardview animations no nothing just an appbar and a few cards when i asked roman nurik how they planned to put these in he simply replied with thats where party libraries come in because of course why would google care about their own platform if you ask me their inability to communicate understand real life scenarios and help their own supporters is what brought them here in the first place
Android,not_removed,the problem is google will happily tell you what ui elements should look and act like without any real concrete examples or builtin libraries to do it take for example the bottom navigation bar recently introduced there was a big fanfare surrounding it without any actual ui elements introduced to make it easy and intuitive developers were expected to just implement it themselves with the base ui elements like linearlayout etc while carefully measuring the size and distance of everything why not just introduce a new ui element called bottomnavigationbar that had all the heavy lifting and quirks handled for us making us do it ourselves means that well all get it wrong in at least one way meaning for the user that every app looks and handles a little bit different this isnt what standards are for
Android,not_removed,it still feels halfbaked android studio is always broken for this or that reason many of the tutorials dont build on each other if google put more effort into outreach i think the ecosystem would be much better eg i was trying to figure out today way adb shell wouldnt connect and could not find anything better than so posts about trying a different usb port its also just difficult in general to debug android issues eg anything related to the manifest why is my broadcastreceiver not working no idea and no idea how to find out im stuck cargoculting solutions from so and eventually just gave up
Android,not_removed,the sad part is that image is already out of date due to the sms only messengers new icon
Android,not_removed,but its already all in hangouts someone needs to teach google why pontiac oldsmobile saturn and mercury dont exist anymore
Android,not_removed,v bug fixes
Android,not_removed,yeah i guess thats fine
Android,not_removed,dont forget adding very important features to enterprise products like emoji such ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,google could fucking negate the need for other telecom companies if they got their heads on straight with google voice its a goddamn ten pound uncut diamond they just need to put a tiny bit of effort in
Android,not_removed,it should be trivial for a company of their size to coordinate a app and desktop launch its pathetic that they cant
Android,not_removed,they can only make a web client but not a proper desktop client like imessage which has great user experience oh yeah google doesnt care actual customers experience
Android,not_removed,theyll kill keep in a couple years i guarantee it
Android,not_removed,its crazy that their best app is a damn photo storage solution i love it and all its features but cmon
Android,not_removed,ive been using wwwinoreadercom it has a free and paid versions i use free no complaints theres a mobile app and a web app both simple yet well done imo its not as good as reader but its the closest ive found
Android,not_removed,httpstheoldreadercom is pretty good
Android,not_removed,same here i loved the shit out of google reader
Android,not_removed,im pretty happy with newsblur myself
Android,not_removed,i use feedly it works pretty well
Android,not_removed,the old reader is pretty good
Android,not_removed,try theoldreadercom i wandered around and this is my favorite google reader replacement it was the only service without a lockin strategy theres nothing as time efficient as rss feeds yet
Android,not_removed,newsblur
Android,not_removed,second inoreadercom good ideas but programming not wonderful to date
Android,not_removed,httpbazquxcom very compact google readerlike design its not free but that way at least theres a chance itll survive
Android,not_removed,funny me too i tried others for a couple weeks and then gave up
Android,not_removed,feedly works
Android,not_removed,feedly picked up the mantle and actually imported your feed list directly from google they have a paid option but theyve had a free option that imo is better than reader ever was since day one
Android,not_removed,thats exactly how i feel with fast food nowadays new burger whatever it will be gone next month better to not get attached its like every time i went somewhere i had to order something else because what i went there to get was gone
Android,not_removed,because theyve got a bunch of best and brightest so nobody is will do grunt work to make a product succeed leadership doesnt understand how to motivate people to do grunt work because they havent done any since they built the search engine in a phrase hero worship is to blame
Android,not_removed,not justifying google abandoning talk but the move to hangouts was a switch from xmpp to a proprietary protocol the problem with xmpp is that its too open with no vettingtrustfederation so spam was a huge problem on the platform hangouts has its share of problems but spam is certainly not one of them
Android,not_removed,id imagine theres a bunch of people from front lines through lowermiddle management that both understand and agree completely but also value their jobs too much to fight leadership over it to me it seems the organization has reached a point where the size and bureaucracy has lead to a culture change too significant to recover from but thats just a guess
Android,not_removed,thats fine too hire a bunch of cheaper guys to maintain the code then
Android,not_removed,assistant is an interesting feature and the only thing i used in allo since noone else i know had it installed but why on earth they just dont integrate that into google now is beyond me
Android,not_removed,god forbid
Android,not_removed,the problem was google didnt see the social news craze coming and so didnt see a way to make money with it like facebook now does
Android,not_removed,feedly pocket integration completely revamped how i consume news
Android,not_removed,seriously why cant inbox be a continuallypresent option for all gmail accounts why cant all google payment features be rolled into one app why cant all google mobile messaging apps be rolled into one or two apps its great that there are all these ingenious project managers but there needs to be some more heavyhandedness from on high directing the overall product portfolio whether that means there are two apps for every app one standard and main app and an experimental platform for refinement and testing or just like chrome and chrome beta a second app under the same name to beta test so frustrating the only good news is that i see people mentioning this more and more and in my experience its hard for companies to ignore a tide rising in that way
Android,not_removed,thankfully inbox and gmail access the same system just display it in a different layout thats how hangouts and allo should be same chats and people but different experiences but nope new system
Android,not_removed,i believe they explained right off the bat that inbox was too whacky to roll out as an update to gmail i cant fault them for this strategy
Android,not_removed,because its a very different experience and concept to email that if merged will be worse inbox is one case where i approve their approach
Android,not_removed,i never cared for inbox and would be pretty upset if it rolled into my gmail uninvited
Android,not_removed,i use the web appits a beautiful thing
Android,not_removed,because its a completely different take on the email workflow and to try to jam both into one product would be horribly messy and confusing
Android,not_removed,its probably a full redesign and rearchitecture by a different team who can focus on the new doing something that like that on the existing codebase and rolling it out to all users would probably be a tad risky and time consuming coming out with an entirely new product and encouraging folks to default to it feels like a safer alternative that would give the team working on the new hotness maximum freedom and laser focus when enough users have moved and theyre confident the new solution can sustain the user base that was on gmail they can just default everyone to inbox and eventually can gmail once and for all anything goes wrong they move everyone back and act like it didnt happen
Android,not_removed,i use gmail for work and inbox for home usage my personal email gets assaulted by everything known to man whole my work email only gets stuff that needs to be read as well as a lot of autogenerated reports that end up as low priority
Android,not_removed,that was the original plan but google employees who didnt want gmail to change revolted so they made it two apps that use the same underlying data
Android,not_removed,because gmail is sacred ground for google it is one of their more popular products and their user base includes many businesses applications that are businessoriented dont follow the same update pattern as traditional customeroriented systems they evolve much more slowly by design because google doesnt want to compromise well established business processes it is for this same reason that google is taking ages to update the google calendar web ui inbox is not just an app its an entire workflow integrating inbox features into gmail would represent too much of a paradigm shift further cluttering gmail interface and as result confusing or worse alienating some of its users in particular businesses i think inbox is actually an example of fragmentation done right
Android,not_removed,i guess inbox is perfect for the simple user ive been using inbox since its beta days and i dont miss the gmail app at all on my computer though i still use gmail since the web version of inbox is pretty much the mobile app with more wasted white space and it doesnt feel like it was meant to be used via a mouse
Android,not_removed,i really dont get what people love about inbox i gave it a shot for a few months and it just didnt do the things i needed it to do and i deal with lots of attachments
Android,not_removed,what browser do you use you can have an amazing gaming pc but ie can still turn a beautiful spa app into a glitchy pile of shit
Android,not_removed,thats exactly why i downloaded it lol
Android,not_removed,how can you guys live with this clutter 使用日志发送到中央审查机构。 通过huawei ads by comcast
Android,not_removed,hahaha who the hell uses windows phones in myflairisactuallyserious
Android,not_removed,wow thats very unprofessional and spammy tactic
Android,not_removed,assistant and incognito chat would like to have a word
Android,not_removed,the nexus never really went mainstream though did it lets be honest
Android,not_removed,he tweeted that sms wouldnt make sense on allo im trying to find the tweet as proof but he may have deleted it because i know everyone else replied to that tweet basically shitting on him and allo
Android,not_removed,i just want the desktop client
Android,not_removed,maybe hes hoping sms support includes a web app so he can text from a computer
Android,not_removed,i use imessage because i can text from my mac i tried many solutions on android but they were all buggy or inconsistent
Android,not_removed,they know but launching a new app looked better on their resume then adding new features to an existing one
Android,not_removed,yo dumbfucks i am da allo team and i decree that even if someone like apple came out tomorrow with imessage for android they couldnt do sms integration k what do you mean facebook and signal already do it forgot his name but damn that guy as annoying wonder how he gets to keep the job
Android,not_removed,stickers are huge in certain countries but we have line viber kaokao whatsapp telegram etc
Android,not_removed,oh dont misunderstand theyre important which is why you use for example telegram more features pretty big userbase stickers better sticker support lots of stuff i still dont know what google was thinking with allo probably a manager who wanted to pad their resumee
Android,not_removed,i think you may have been whooshed with those comments
Android,not_removed,ugh i couldnt believe when he tweeted that one post from this subreddit that supposedly explained the challenges of sms fallback in android the reddit post basically said that sms fallback would be bad because split conversations would be confusing lots of people commented noting that sms fallback would be an adoption bridge and give the app some utility while we waited for allo users to hit a critical mass and that if allo only sent allo messages to other allo users and never sent sms to them it wouldnt be a problem i couldnt believe a project lead shared something so poorly thought out
Android,not_removed,larry page seriously he should not be the ceo cto yes cio yes but not ceo google was nothing under pagebrin besides a more underground search engine that was awesome and schmidt is the one that made google a household name theres been almost no major market takeovers since page took back over and tons of hot air
Android,not_removed,wow that video just makes me think you were the chosen one maybe its because ive never owned a nexus or pixel device but i probably only see or of the animations shown in that video on a daily basis material design had so much promise it makes me sad to think that video was posted years ago and i barely recognize any of the animations in it maybe its time for me to check if the grass is greener on the other side well ive got one more year on my contract so itll be iphone vs pixel
Android,not_removed,i hear what you are saying there are still a ton of components i wish were in the sdkappcompat from material design but even for your example httpsdeveloperandroidcomreferenceandroidsupportdesignwidgetbottomnavigationviewhtml was added to the support library in october so the components being available is something that is actively happening
Android,not_removed,well they did add bottomnavigationview in support library but it still doesnt support any of the cool stuff that its supposed to
Android,not_removed,engineer but its the same car engineer marketing exec no it isnt this one is a mercury and that one is a ford engineer but its the same car
Android,not_removed,i still cant wrap my head around why oldsmobile ever existed as a gm division i mean pontiac was kinda midmarket performance saturn was supposed to be toyotakiller mercury was fords buick was olds ever anything more than a shitter even more forgettable buick division
Android,not_removed,minor text fixes
Android,not_removed,surely you mean fixes to the legged stickers
Android,not_removed,stickers of bug fixes
Android,not_removed,darker icon colors coming in hot
Android,not_removed,you dropped these
Android,not_removed,i cant like this comment enough google voice breaks the carriers chains i dont even know my actual mobile number i only know my google voice number google could leverage that kind of power into something like an actual imessage type service
Android,not_removed,and its just been sitting since at least with very little updates or improvements to it im starting to migrate away from it simply because with hangouts being relegated to the enterprise ghetto i cant rely on it as my primary number like i used to anymore
Android,not_removed,this conversation is too depressing im going for a walk with my google tracks wait
Android,not_removed,its not even properly integrated with gmail yet i thought their idea was to replace tasks with it but up until now its a separate system now i have both tasks and keep and that in itself is very disorganized
Android,not_removed,i use keep all the time but as a product it is seriously underwhelming for it to be truly useful it needs to be integrated in nowassistants reminders and have a native macos and windows and linux if you really want to go there app not a chrome web app that way it would actually become a worthwhile note and reminder app
Android,not_removed,they wont because its used as a note app in the pixels and they want it preinstalled for their users
Android,not_removed,yep keep wont be sticking around for too long its too simple and doesnt make the company much money
Android,not_removed,you cant even find keep in the shortcut in chrome even the more options it is nowhere to be found and i seriously love keep especially integrated on my smart watch i can put my shopping list on my wrist and check it off and it works perfectly
Android,not_removed,thats because it is the biggest money maker besides search all those images are datamined by google you already get ad impressions based on location of photos pretty soon youll get it based on content they are using your photos to train their ai too things like chat are worthless by comparison so you can suddenly see why they put the incompetents on chat
Android,not_removed,ive found feedly to be a more than able alternative
Android,not_removed,its the century fox of food and apps
Android,not_removed,when you convince everybody you hire that theyre the best and the brightest its hard to convince them to keep a product running in maintenance mode
Android,not_removed,i had used google talk ever since it was out and had no spam on it at all
Android,not_removed,eh microsoft was worse and is looking ok these days theres a chance they right the ship
Android,not_removed,doesnt matter their internal rewards system undoubtedly gives engineers more money for new shit in fact hire a bunch of cheaper guys is what they do now work on existing products and fix bugs get paid less if they flipped it around and paid these guys the same amount of money as those that are innovating i think it would help never gonna happen though how many eggs does google have in the basket that is ads
Android,not_removed,if only theyd been willing to keep it going not piss off their users and eventually discover that they were perfectly positioned in a new market without even planning it genius
Android,not_removed,exactly chromecast integrated perfectly with home my only conclusion is that there is a serious disconnect between management goals and devs goals no true dev would say hey this is the way to go with all these different messaging apps
Android,not_removed,coding became too bloated and convoluted see google integration etc in hangouts to add more features best case scenario was to create another app not apps however google deserves allll the blame for not incorporating allo and duo into messenger silly decision
Android,not_removed,every time gmail has a tiny change in the interface people go nuts no way they could have rolled out inbox within gmail
Android,not_removed,as someone who doesnt care for inbox this is definitely one situation where im glad google made a separate product
Android,not_removed,i fully agree with this inbox and gmail are wholly different approaches to managing email but thats just not true of the various messaging apps they all make text pop up and they all have contact lists
Android,not_removed,agree im actually ok with gmail inbox since i can use either one seems like a total waste of resources and confusing product branding but at least it doesnt disrupt things i installed allo and duo instantly when i read about them in some article but once i realized no one i know uses it it was immediately uninstalled if i could interact with hangouts users i would have probably kept it
Android,not_removed,holy crap i never thought about that allo should have been accessing hangouts internal api while showcasing nrw features not creating a new userbase
Android,not_removed,using firefox mostly
Android,not_removed,allo shouldnt ask for it upfront either its compatible with the partial permissions setup you can turn any of them offon in app settings
Android,not_removed,to be fair google makes most of their money from tracking people
Android,not_removed,maybe being an early adopter on a messaging service isnt such a good idea do you feel you gained anything by making the switch ive continued to use hangouts since it has pretty much all i and the people i chat with need most importantly cross platform and multi device support the business focus is only a plus businesses have a much lower tolerance of flaky behavior than consumers and they dont care about sticker packs
Android,not_removed,its ridiculous spez is the greatest ceo of all time
Android,not_removed,i remember this too but cant find any trace of it now weird
Android,not_removed,hangouts works great for that even phone calls come through well on the computer
Android,not_removed,the fragmentation of these similar apps is just ridiculous allo duo hangouts messenger why why do we need so many different programs that essentially overlap just integrate the best of all of them into one app or integrate all of the advanced features into hangouts and keep messenger around as a lightweight alternative for smsmms only
Android,not_removed,its not surprising considering the way allo handled sms at launch what an awful way to onboard android users onto a supposedly superior messaging platform and were not even talking about a complete lack of multidevice and web support its like they released the original imessage except in and its also not as advanced as the original imessage was
Android,not_removed,larry page isnt googles ceo sundar pichai is
Android,not_removed,youtube as a professional content platform
Android,not_removed,any front end web dev libraries css js etc would be nice to have animations especially
Android,not_removed,my app started to stall a little just before material design became ubiquitous since then ive been looking to jump back on the bandwagon but ive found it really difficult and using party libraries feels like a poor solution would it be so hard for the nav drawer template to have an option to throw in a placeholder page some transitionsanimations some lifecycle events and some common usage scenarios i realise the methods are all there and the support libraries go a long way but for part time devs youre going to spend a tonne of time finding a workflow instead of refining your idea i dont see why its such a hard task party libraries can be deprecated and you may find incompatibilities bugs etc why cant the template demonstrate some robust usage scenarios
Android,not_removed,but they still have a ton of room for improvement a lot of stuff is missing in the support library even though its shown off in the md guidelines for instance google loves to plaster circular image views all over the place but thats not a feature you can use in the support library you have to either put your own together or use a party library another one is the bottomnavigationview they added it into but it has yet to support a good number of the things they display in the md docs just yesterday i was working on trying to hide on scroll or change colors when switching tabs and i found out i have to write my own behaviors for that its like the ui designers and the programmers never talk to each other at google
Android,not_removed,exactly it is far from perfect and there are still a lot of components needed we just got httpsdeveloperandroidcomreferenceandroidsupportdesignwidgetbottomnavigationviewhtml in october but it has definitely moved in the right direction
Android,not_removed,good to know about bottomnavigationview thanks will definitely take a look at throwing out my clunky implementation and roll with this
Android,not_removed,change engineer to salesman
Android,not_removed,gm had a strategy at one time called the companion make program chevy was the inexpensive starter car for young people the baseline then you had two branches pontiac was a chevy with scoops and a hotter engine olds was a chevy with a little more style and comfort cadillac was the top of the luxury line for your bankers and lawyers but buick was there for people who were pretty rich but didnt want to appear ostentatious like a doctor rolling up to a house call in a cadillac might send the wrong message there were a couple of other brands in there that ended lasalle was between caddy and buick there was marquette which was a little cheaper buick etc geo came along as a cheaper chevy over time those defined roles started getting wavy as the buick people wanted to have something a little sportier on the lot and the pontiac people wanted a luxury trim they all wanted a little bit of their neighboring pie slice so the tldr is olds existed as a comfortable yin to pontiacs sporty yang
Android,not_removed,olds existed on name recognition alone towards the end there they used to be a quality brand but as gm got bigger they kept cutting corners everywhere this included badge engineering some of their most iconic brands like pontiac and oldsmobile if you look at them now theyre doing it significantly less but buick is falling victim to it again i laugh every time i see those thats a buick commercials now yeah its not a buick its just a rebadged chevy
Android,not_removed,free pornhub subscription to users
Android,not_removed,sms integration would be nice
Android,not_removed,theyre at least adding some themes next update at least theyve said as much my eyes thank all devs who implement amoled dark themes
Android,not_removed,always forget something every time
Android,not_removed,whats so spacial about google voice legit asking
Android,not_removed,oh god dont make me cry i loved that program
Android,not_removed,raise your hand if you have ever been personally victimized by google ✋
Android,not_removed,dont forget about reminders in inbox calendar keep and google now
Android,not_removed,very disorganized ahh yes as is tradition with google
Android,not_removed,out of curiousity because i use keep currently do you know of an app that does have all those features
Android,not_removed,yeah theres absolutely zero data to be gained from everyones everyday communications s
Android,not_removed,i dont know i think there has to be an audience out there for chat eg such as myself i use text based communications often i dont take photos if they looked in my photos account and all theyll find is pictures of pcbs and nicely polished acidetched steel alloynickel superalloy samples mounted in bakelite oh and sheets of battery electrodes what the hell are they going to sell me based on that an entire cast sheet of hotrolled steel some singlecrystal superalloy ingots delivered by semitruck a tub of lithium i do however chat a lot about stuff i actually bought and use
Android,not_removed,i do actually use that from time to time but nowhere near as often as i would be on google reader
Android,not_removed,meh ive found it to be okay it has a modern feel but lacks the social features that added a lot of value for me ui can crawl to a halt if you have a group with a lot of feeds in it and youre trying to organize them
Android,not_removed,devs are the first group to want to start from scratch for everything its always going to be so much better with the new languages and frameworks of the day
Android,not_removed,lol thats soo funny you should say that
Android,not_removed,honestly as the other guy said its probably the opposite when it comes to the web new tech comes out every day in fact in the time it took to write this comment five javascript frameworks were just released especially at a dev driven company like google i can totally see them pushing to get rid of old shit so they can rewrite the app in a new framework thatll improve the underlying performance of course theyll have to scrape all the features and start over but at least video quality is better this is completely different than at apple where its a designer driven firm
Android,not_removed,i gave inbox a try for about a week and i just cant wrap my head around it i was able to eventually figure out how to do everything i needed to do but it was an exercise in frustration finally gave up and went back to the gmail app i can however see why some people prefer it i guess im more of a ui traditionalist
Android,not_removed,i really wish i could use the inbox interface at my work instead of outlook my personal email is really simple and can be managed fine with filters inboxs task managing features would be fantastic for a work environment though
Android,not_removed,they rolled out some pretty big changes to gmail like the priority inbox and the tabs it was fine nobody forced you to opt in and you could switch between those views with the click of a button so whats different about snoozing is anybody actually going to care about getting another toolbar button and keyboard shortcut when handling email or bundling is that really so different than the priorityinbox tabs that people would revolt if you gave them the option to move those tabs into a single inbox view so what couldnt they have rolled out in gmail the infinitescrolling ui where even single conversations have to expand inline surrounded by everything else in your inbox good thats the worst part of inbox its slow on most computers ive tried it on the whole interface takes much longer to load the url and basic browser navigation is outright ignored to a shocking degree i cant actually come up with a single positive there theres one way this makes sense inbox couldve made sense as the replacement for gmail if it was obviously better enough that they couldve had them both sidebyside until inbox got feature parity only since inbox launched they dont seem to have put any effort at all into bringing inbox up to feature parity with gmail if anything theyve drifted further apart as brandnew features get added to each product
Android,not_removed,this is exactly what i love about it it has all the satisfying aspects of getting things off my to do list it feels way less daunting to me than the standard email setup and im way more productive with my emails now
Android,not_removed,if i am not mistaken you cannot actually sync the sms messages thats what is important to me
Android,not_removed,you know which one it is
Android,not_removed,the solution is probably just to make a new app itll be the new standard if we can get everybody to download it the messaging problem will be fixed lets make it simple and informative so users know what the app is conglomeration by google can be the new name of the app it will even allow users and businesses to be bridged so context base ads can be brought into the conversation based on users commonly searched terms
Android,not_removed,the messenger you mean facebook messenger app
Android,not_removed,is google an alphabet company or vice versa
Android,not_removed,sundar pichai is more of a president of a division in google that got rebranded to alphabet the shittyness of google began long before they became alphabet
Android,not_removed,a couple years ago they had google polymer idk what happened to it now though last i saw it was only supported by chrome and fairly resource intensive
Android,not_removed,good point
Android,not_removed,pornhub stickers
Android,not_removed,well add some sms stickers thanks for your feedback
Android,not_removed,you set forwarding to your phone number to your gb number someone callstexts your gv number and it rings all of the numbers youre forwarding to or sends text messages to your phone and the web you never need to port your number you can text from a desktop and you can use wifi for callstexts it is brilliant break your phone eh pick up a prepaid for a few days and forward to that number at work you can text from your desk while you have gmail or hangouts open very helpful if you use gmailgapps for work going international no charges for calling with wifi in germany it doesnt care where you are have an old phoneipod touchtablet you can use all of this on that too without a cellular plan it is odd to answer phone calls on a inch tablet though it works but it is strange
Android,not_removed,i still use google tracks everyday just cant use the cloud part
Android,not_removed,tasks is integrated to calendar keep is not afaik i dont even know where google now and inbox keeps its reminders its like the different product teams dont talk to each other
Android,not_removed,evernote their professional version isnt that expensive most people dont need the top tier you can user zapier to integrate evernote with whatever other managers you need to but evernote does a pretty good job integrating itself with just about every major tool
Android,not_removed,this time well do it right
Android,not_removed,i stand corrected
Android,not_removed,it took me two tries but i now prefer inbox for my casual email reading on mobile on desktop and for work i still prefer the classic gmail
Android,not_removed,what i like about it is that i can keep my inbox clean by removing messages im done with without actually deleting them ie theyre still there in done so i can always go back and look at or search for them of course you can do the same thing with gmails archive functionality but the inbox workflow is a lot easier
Android,not_removed,the simple explanation its exactly like gmail but it has a million shortcuts to mark stuff done as opposed to read or deletedarchived marking something done is far less consequential you can still tell if youve read it or not it doesnt get deleted and in fact is still organized properly its just not in your inbox so its out of the way and you have a much better chance of seeing the stuff thats important on top of this it autocategorizes all your emails and groups them together so that you can mark the whole stack done at one time after a particularly lazy span i was able to go through months of emails in just a few minutes marking huge swaths of it done and getting it out of the way it also offers handy features like the pin for stuff you dont want to accidentally mark done and reminders that float emails to the forefront later if you wish so in short it allows you to be organized and remain caught up with email without requiring a huge time investment other than the done status and auto categorization there really arent any new concepts to learn its all the same email stuff expertly executed
Android,not_removed,that sounds pretty unreasonable of him also wouldnt be able to show the camera feed without him accepting the permission first not sure what point youre trying to make
Android,not_removed,yes except these are all google products they could eliminate and integrate at will
Android,not_removed,no httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappsmessaging which is literally the dumbest name i can think of for an smsmms application google
Android,not_removed,alphabet is the parent company of google while sundar is the ceo of google page is ceo of alphabet
Android,not_removed,google is a company of alphabet
Android,not_removed,so to avoid confusion youre meaning larry page is alphabets ceo google a division of alphabet is run by sundar pichai
Android,not_removed,sundar pichai is googles ceo
Android,not_removed,google polymer i thought that was more about web components than just styles and animation im wondering if theres something like the md equivalent of bootstrap where i can use it to easily create md sites i dunno to me that seems like an obvious step if you want md to become a thing
Android,not_removed,sms means stickers more stickers right
Android,not_removed,and well send them with an sms
Android,not_removed,ive noticed keep reminders pop up in keep calendar and inbox inbox reminders are in inbox and calendar but not keep calendar reminders are only in calendar ive stopped using inbox reminders except for snoozing emails because inbox reminders disappear from my notification list as soon as i open inbox doesnt matter if i hit the launcher shortcut or an email notification while keep reminders stay put unless i specifically tap them so i can use the keep app icon and retain all my reminders notifications i think they have forgotten about calendar reminders at this point are those related to gmail tasks i have been using inbox exclusively since when i got a beta invite so i dont remember at this point
Android,not_removed,google now uses keep or at least it does for shopping lists
Android,not_removed,thats exactly what ive done work in gmail app personal in inbox i like it way better this way
Android,not_removed,same here i use inbox on mobile and gmail webclient on my desktop still using gmail on my phone for my work mail i like the inbox notification system and its integration to other google products ok google set reminder creates a reminder that i can manage from inbox one point where allo fell flat on its face for me i just dont need another completely independent system to manage reminders
Android,not_removed,yep that was a revelation for me ive used gmail for years with tens of thousands of mails just cluttering up my inbox inbox finally helped me to get all that sorted out it didnt occur to me to use that functionality from gmail
Android,not_removed,slide right slide left slide right slide left inbox clean
Android,not_removed,why not just archive them based on subject in gmail then you dont have a bunch of random messages bunched together in the done folder
Android,not_removed,i just cleaned up years of email clutter thanks inbox but for real you guys convinced me to download it and now im free of the clutter feels good
Android,not_removed,so is allo owned directly by google or alphabet
Android,not_removed,jesus h tittyfucking christ what a mess we cant even nail down whos who in the first comment no wonder googles such a mongolian culsterfuck
Android,not_removed,and google is a wholly owned subsidiary of alphabet with page as its ceo so pichai answers to him
Android,not_removed,sort of hes the divisional head there is only one ceo the alphabet ceo because google isnt a publicly traded company alphabet of which google is a subsidiary is the ceo is usually appointed by the board of directors whereas divisionalsubsidary heads are usually picked by someone else like upper management in most cases the csuite although it isnt unheard of for the board to decide on who fills these posts as well
Android,not_removed,if im not mistaken they definitely had aspects focused on animations and such i dont remember much because i think i was like at the time and didnt know much beyond csshtmljquery but i do remember something about polymer letting you create custom html tags with custom animations and it had the material design ones preloaded again its been i think like years so i might be completely mistaken
Android,not_removed,angular material materializecss and the newly released mdio might be worth checking out
Android,not_removed,if it doesnt have xvideos support in addition to ph its doa
Android,not_removed,youre probably not far off
Android,not_removed,youre right gmail tasks are basically calendar tasks too i dont seem to see keep reminders in my calendar this is why i am still using the old gmail tasks you can add email directly to it shiftt when in gmail then add a due date it will be plotted in your tasks calendar automatically
Android,not_removed,can do both with inbox automatically grouped are things like finance and marketing etc plus you can make rules for manually set categories eg any emails coming from family members automatically file themselves together under family for me
Android,not_removed,seems like the point is this isnt a very good anecdote because your father has bizarre unreasonable standards that arent compatible with what he was trying to do
Android,not_removed,im afraid your dad is right though if you dont resist privacy invasion you wont have any left
Android,not_removed,i think its better than those two aesthetically the ui is much more modern and appealing in my opinion and the barrier to entry for new users is lower than hangouts im content to use it for messaging my friends who are into android and will appreciated the added functionality as its added over time everyone seems to get really mad about this but i dont think its that difficult to understand that hangouts is enterprise chat and allo is mainstream consumer focused with bonus ai also using your paranoid dad as the primary example of why the app is trash kind of undermines your point
Android,not_removed,allo is developed by google alphabet just owns everything google related google the google fiber subsidiary the self driving car subsidiary
Android,not_removed,even the tiniest of their products has the same clusterfuck of names example chromecast was renamed google cast just to be renamed again chromecast i honestly cant comprehend how they make such terrible decisions inside google edit word
Android,not_removed,someone one day is going to google who is the ceo of google be directed to this thread and not find an answer
Android,not_removed,exactly larry page is an excellent engineerscientist who couldnt really get real investments to get google off the ground much without bringing eric schmidt to guide google to a real valuable company with real monetization and revenue streams eventually page took back over as ceo and schmidt stepped away when he took some courses on business and was mentored by business people to know how to manage his own company you dont get to the level of experience to manage a massive global conglomerate in a few years the reason ceos are considered overpaid is people dont realize the ridiculous level of experience required to manage a massive ship worth billions ceos getting quarter million salaries on up on average have over years of experience theyve probably closed ridiculous deals in sales or have multiple experiences as a different clevel position that exceeded their peers what im getting at is larry is doing a job leading a multibillion dollar global conglomerate that takes decades of experience and examples of highly successful things throughout the years including the guy right under the ceo they replaced their highly successful guy that grew them massively in no time with larry theres no surprise why googlealphabet is confusing as fuck these days
Android,not_removed,you dont need to be a publicly traded company to have a ceo nor does being subsidiary disqualify a company from having a ceo googles own webpages refer to pichai as the ceo in multiple places and the official blog post that outlined the transition to alphabet specifically named pichai as ceo of google
Android,not_removed,my head hurts after reading this
Android,not_removed,hello its google allo again
Android,not_removed,all the reminders except the one that is crossed out are keep reminders
Android,not_removed,keep reminders are in my calendar here the whole situation keep reminders show in inbox calendar and google nowassistant inbox reminders show in calendar and google now assistant google nowassistant reminders show in calendar and inbox calendar event show in google now assistant so if you want your reminders to show everywhere create them in keep
Android,not_removed,im with his dad too many apps want to know where you are all the time i dont care if it can offer me coupons for where ive been id rather them not know my every move
Android,not_removed,kinda wish there was some semblance of a list however brief of these number of bugfixes and optimizations along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users
Android,not_removed,would anyone who installs this please let me know if it fixes the it might be worth it for me to sign up for the beta program and install the sneak peek if that is fixed edit just in case anyone ever comes back and stumbles upon this post the beta did fix the car bluetooth issues with my nexus
Android,not_removed,rip nexus it is neither getting the beta nor final release
Android,not_removed,nexus is eol for major updates now only security updates until october no one has posted the release notes this public beta release may have various stability battery or performance issues on supported devices some apps may not function as expected on this public beta release this includes googles apps as well as other apps this public beta release is compatibility test suite cts approved on supported devices apps that depend on cts approved builds should work normally on these devices android pay for example known issues general on pixel c devices quick settings may not be visible in some cases pixel launcher may crash when trying to search apps while a physical keyboard is connected occasional ui hangs wifi stability issues setup wizard black screen during transition from boot animation to setup wizard wifi is turned off after completing setup even if user has chosen to set up the device using mobile data sms messages may not be restored during devicetodevice transfer
Android,not_removed,were rolling out a public beta to eligible devices that are enrolled in the android beta program including pixel and pixel xl nexus nexus player and pixel c devices were also preparing an update for nexus that we expect to release soon i wonder why the release for is delayed fu google
Android,not_removed,god please let this fix the random lte disconnections
Android,not_removed,factory images are up d
Android,not_removed,i really hope it improves the battery life on the fingers crossed
Android,not_removed,android is an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements so it includes a number of bugfixes and optimizations along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users
Android,not_removed,whenever some of yall get this update installed will you share with the rest of us if there is anything new and exciting thanks
Android,not_removed,is there any info on what they are actually changing
Android,not_removed,looks like thats the end of the line for nexus here it had a good run more than expected
Android,not_removed,any change logs floating around for this yet
Android,not_removed,hopefully pure nexus is able to update to this asap
Android,not_removed,android is an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements guys its literally impossible for google to support nexus the technology isnt there yet
Android,not_removed,strange naming i would expect for a maintenance release that takes a couple of months to land
Android,not_removed,wifi stability issues is a know problem thanks god ive been a lot into this problem on my
Android,not_removed,but does it have night mode
Android,not_removed,god bless lineageos and every other custom roms
Android,not_removed,hopefully it gets rid of the bootlooping problems on some nexus devices
Android,not_removed,has anyone got the ota yet its been over hours since i enrolled to beta and i got nothing on my pixel xl
Android,not_removed,this is kinda weird i am enrolled into the beta on my pixel xl and its not throwing the beta at me in the past just enrolling into the beta would immediately send it to the phone is this a deferred rollout
Android,not_removed,will this fix the bluetooth issues thats what i want to know im still on because anything higher screws everything up
Android,not_removed,i hope they release this fix
Android,not_removed,devs trolling us with neoplasms
Android,not_removed,this is actually the first time i dont care about having the newest and greatest all the way up to the nexus i would flash the betas roms anything just to have the newest features but with the pixel idk the price availability i lost interest
Android,not_removed,i hope this fixes my honda bluetooth problems
Android,not_removed,minor text fixes
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus that received the update and now refuses to boot anyone else facing the same problem
Android,not_removed,shame just got rid of my oh well its for the better p
Android,not_removed,what why does the nexus have to wait and not the nexus what the hell is going on here
Android,not_removed,welp getting rid of my nexus due to the early shutdown issue now they announce this hmm
Android,not_removed,calling it itt rip nexus even tho there are roms
Android,not_removed,no nexus oh well im happy running rr
Android,not_removed,umi dont even have nougat yet roflthis slow update shit needs to stop ffsi wish there could only be a few months between update release and all phones getting it can someone explain why they drag their ass so hard on this stuff youd think samsung would be doing their best to get nougat out to all phones and pushing carriers to getting the update out asap because of the note or maybe they think the note thing wasnt that big of a deal and people have forgotten about it after all they just have to wait a few months before the announcement of possibly new phones the edge and the note
Android,not_removed,nexus is getten fucken rekt ayy
Android,not_removed,does at this point anyone still care most are still on old versions
Android,not_removed,how long until it comes to verizon
Android,not_removed,tbf they did list some
Android,not_removed,well they gotta be major bugfixes and optimizations because the nexus and cant run them
Android,not_removed,you must be new to google products
Android,not_removed,apple does the same before i switched over to a pixel i enrolled in their beta program i updated my plus to the other day and no notes were provided
Android,not_removed,also please let me know if the has finally actually been fixed more than a year later or do i still need to use a pos lg phone running as an player in because i cant have proper control of the volume while using my bluetooth accessories
Android,not_removed,well something there with bt has been touched
Android,not_removed,fwiw in a teardown i do see some bluetooth changes i dont have any bluetooth issues to test though
Android,not_removed,what about the constant studdering of audio over bluetooth i have bt in my car and multiple headsets and it is a problem no matter what im using probably studderscuts in and out times at least for every song never had this problem with my nexus or
Android,not_removed,i signed up my ill make a post when it gets pushed to my device to say if it fixed my car bluetooth issue
Android,not_removed,been in the beta program with this problem once it gets pushed to me ill let you know
Android,not_removed,it might depend on the car too im on and my car bluetooth works fine calls work perfectly nexus and
Android,not_removed,i know im a little late on this response but can someone also confirm if connecting to enterprise wifi networks works on the pixel and pixel xl right now the only workaround is to disable certificate authentication
Android,not_removed,this is supposed to be the update that fixes it
Android,not_removed,its fixed in my chevy
Android,not_removed,it fixed that bt issue but caused the bootloop issue on mine phone was out of warranty and its now bricked
Android,not_removed,its a real shame considering the speakerphone on the nexus and that will apparently be its final state some dev on xda in short order apparently google just forgot to include some necessary lines in an xml file nothing like going straight to google for updates and quality
Android,not_removed,hooray for custom rom support d
Android,not_removed,take this as an opportunity to unlock the bootloader and install elemental x my phone feels brand new no stuttering no battery throttle just performance
Android,not_removed,welcome to the afterlife nexus
Android,not_removed,well it got additional major update than was promised
Android,not_removed,if the pixel gets his sort of treatment itll be my last google phone
Android,not_removed,nexus devices get android version updates for at least years from when the device became available on the google store after years we cant guarantee additional updates nexus october
Android,not_removed,its still getting security updates its not dead
Android,not_removed,oh no how will you ever live without updates so minor that they werent even enumerated on the announcement page
Android,not_removed,released november end of lifed january when the nexus line was inexpensive i could understand the year cycle but that changed with the nexus and should be reflected in the time they support the device and by support i dont mean security updates thats a bare minimum
Android,not_removed,get ready to love it all over again
Android,not_removed,you dont have to root to install a custom rom if thats what youre talking about
Android,not_removed,yeah but its not like was a flawless update looks like a bugfix update so even though the nexus is eol it doesnt really feels fair to me
Android,not_removed,wait what i only got this a year ago edit this is what happens when i get peerpressured into buying phones ah well edit i doublederped i have the not the
Android,not_removed,were now that uncle who only gets invited to certain family events
Android,not_removed,is the new
Android,not_removed,oh man i thought that this was just me fingers crossed about this one
Android,not_removed,wtf where they arent up on googles site
Android,not_removed,post link
Android,not_removed,did not improve it my friend i sold my to said its been better than when i sold it to him in october another friend and i both pixel xls have been competing with sots very recently sending screenshots back and forth because for once our battery life is really good
Android,not_removed,randroidpreviews
Android,not_removed,bug fixes and performance improvements
Android,not_removed,new stickers
Android,not_removed,they never post the source until its officially released via imagesotas
Android,not_removed,whats the difference between purenexus and these regular google updates
Android,not_removed,and even if it was there it would be too confusing to users
Android,not_removed,xx is usually for when features are added
Android,not_removed,looks like theres nothing really frontfacing in this release and people expect the feature list to correlate with the bump in version number if theyd increased by people would be whining about no new features
Android,not_removed,same with my so frustrating playing an online game and losing connection
Android,not_removed,unless the hardware supports it then no
Android,not_removed,i got it this afternoon
Android,not_removed,i enrolled my pixel xl last night got the update today
Android,not_removed,i submitted about bug reports related to bluetooth and bluetooth low energy for which are all easily reproduced all i got was a working as intended answer i wouldnt get my hopes up
Android,not_removed,i dont even have and im not savvy enough to flash it myself patiently waiting for the ota
Android,not_removed,yeah get your asses out of here
Android,not_removed,also gave my away kinda miss it now that its flash time
Android,not_removed,what did you replace it with
Android,not_removed,the next sentence says were also preparing an update for nexus that we expect to release soon
Android,not_removed,it says now
Android,not_removed,could be that they are working on a fix for the early shut downs
Android,not_removed,where do you see a update
Android,not_removed,early shutdown is a battery problem replace it
Android,not_removed,what are you replacing it with
Android,not_removed,error your phone got fuckn rekt
Android,not_removed,wrong thread
Android,not_removed,try the stickied question thread
Android,not_removed,people on nexuspixel devices probably care heck people that use roms probably care too
Android,not_removed,we work hard for you to have the best android experience if you encounter any bugs please contact us at androiddevelopersspamgooglecom
Android,not_removed,things and like stuff ya know
Android,not_removed,just reading that pisses me off
Android,not_removed,its as bad as the ohsohelpful updates yo we changed some shit and reset your attempts to block us spying on you but heres a notice that you arent even allowed to copypaste into google have fun writing down that characterlong identifier ps fuck you
Android,not_removed,fuck you caught us we changed nothing
Android,not_removed,i believe those are known issues with the beta not know issues fixed in this beta
Android,not_removed,actually theres a pdf with every beta release check riosbeta
Android,not_removed,what phone are you on now that youve mentioned it my nexus running no longer does that shit
Android,not_removed,and someone set their clocks to the date where do not disturb seemed to disappear and see if google actually fixed it
Android,not_removed,i am using jbl charge and after cant control btvolume besides still has this bug for me
Android,not_removed,nexus maybe i should wait
Android,not_removed,google replaces out of warranty boot loops
Android,not_removed,this is so infuriating part of me loves google and the other half resents it
Android,not_removed,i starred the issuebest i can do i hope yall get a proper fix from google
Android,not_removed,nexus is going to continue to get security updates for a while star the issue and perhaps complain enough and they could always bundle it in with a security update
Android,not_removed,i havent had the update from yet should i ignore it when it arrives
Android,not_removed,my speakerphone works just tested it httpiimgurcomklpfzpapng
Android,not_removed,considering broke the speakerphone on the nexus thats what happens when you choose not to publicly release a beta
Android,not_removed,it will still get security updates and i bet the fix will be pushed in one of them stop spreading rumors
Android,not_removed,rip android pay on the nexus
Android,not_removed,time to learn how tf to do all this then im kind of nervous but i bought a nexus for this exact reason
Android,not_removed,im afraid of having my bootloader unlocked from what i understand if i lose my phone and it gets into the wrong hands with an unlocked bootloader they would be able to bypass my passcode and get my data access to my apps etc is this correct
Android,not_removed,remindme years remind to enjoy his new iphone
Android,not_removed,oh it will people need to understand that qualcomm and other hardware manufactures abandoning their hardwares driversfirmwares is part of that reason maybe this will change when google start manufacturing their cpugpus
Android,not_removed,the nexus has been out since late
Android,not_removed,its still getting security updates its not dead denial denial
Android,not_removed,its not end of life for security and bug fixes
Android,not_removed,hey man im still on the last cm that they put out for the do i have to do a complete format to change over to lineage
Android,not_removed,they put bug fixes in security updates too sometimes they didnt even say what bugs are being fixed in
Android,not_removed,well it was released in late
Android,not_removed,that phone is two year old though you should have know that edit op has a
Android,not_removed,same this is my biggest complaint about the pixels also they market them at the price of the iphone yet only support them for years
Android,not_removed,welcome to android longterm updates are httpswwwredditcomriphone
Android,not_removed,be together not the same
Android,not_removed,peer pressure
Android,not_removed,your peers are really that concerned about which phones you buy
Android,not_removed,damn it uncle bob we dont appreciate you showing up drunk and telling stories about girls their dad was with in college
Android,not_removed,dont you fucking say that
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i got really really good sot when i first installed but shortly thereafter started getting the early shutdown problem and then my sot also fell back down to earth luckily i was able to rma it
Android,not_removed,android kernel is keeping my phone awake for multiple hours a day android os or system constantly tops my battery usage list even above screen
Android,not_removed,for me its the opposite i get and average of hrs of sot when before i would get an average of hrs sometimes more
Android,not_removed,if youre competing then crank up your screen timeout when the phone sits there doing nothing with you not touching it you can get pretty good sot
Android,not_removed,not the guy you replied to but battery life on my has drastically improved since i got it was pretty dismal back when i first got it
Android,not_removed,you make me happy 😊
Android,not_removed,every google changelog ever
Android,not_removed,soooo nothing will change
Android,not_removed,your warranty is now void i am not responsible for bricked devices thermonuclear war or you getting fired because the alarm app failed please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this rom before flashing it you are choosing to make these modifications and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device i will laugh at you a lot bugs see any let me know fingerprint sensor is disabled for a reason not a bug bluetooth gps and lte functionality removed for increased battery gainz
Android,not_removed,and new bugs
Android,not_removed,these devs should talk to the allo team
Android,not_removed,my nexus had night mode from until i lost it with official so does the hardware support it kinda bs cuz it worked so well
Android,not_removed,got it here as well not sure if i like it or not
Android,not_removed,i got tired of waiting and just flashed it manually ah well
Android,not_removed,awesome so potentially i have a month old phone give or take that might not be able to be as secure or as useful as it could be because google are lazy incompetent fucks the phone itself is only months old from release day as well im a huge androidgoogle fan but this is getting to the point of unacceptable if apple pushed an update that crippled the wifi on the macbook and went eh its supposed to do that im sure thered be far more backlash than this okay more people have those than nexus devices but still its a £ device its not cheap and people rely on them for their daily life i know i do
Android,not_removed,no because some of them understand that they bought a device knowing it only has an official update life of years
Android,not_removed,oh well we can wait unless you just have your iphone
Android,not_removed,im going to take a shot in the dark and guess a oneplus
Android,not_removed,not so easy to do in the uk huawei uk dont want anything to do with it
Android,not_removed,edge picked one up for £
Android,not_removed,pixel xl user here caring confirmed
Android,not_removed,i thought the no longer works
Android,not_removed,i see what you did
Android,not_removed,what about this
Android,not_removed,since when you arent allowed to copy and paste into google
Android,not_removed,i have a problem where my phone tells me that hey man we got this cool ok google thing you can use to do searches and stuff just say ok google three times and well make it happen then i do that get the check marks or whatever that ive done it successfully and then nothing happens when i press to try it again since well nothing happened it just goes lol i dont recognize that its annoying because every time it asks me to do that i do it and end up feeling like a fool because fucking google tricked me is this the problem youre describing could it be that my language is set to finnish and it just doesnt work with that or something even if that was the case i dont understand why it asks me to do the whole thing in finnish and then doesnt do jack shit fucking teasing piece of shit im using nexus
Android,not_removed,my bluetooth headphones no longer control my phones volume since on the
Android,not_removed,currently a redmi note have had the problem on all devices however different roms on the note stock on a moto still experienced the problem during my quick test of a while back before the whole cyanogenmod break down
Android,not_removed,ridiculous smh
Android,not_removed,depends on how much you value speakerphone there arent any real significant improvements in main thing ive noticed is app shortcuts in the launcher which i havent found very useful certainly not a worthwhile tradeoff against having speakerphone if google doesnt fix this ill be flashing back to at some point
Android,not_removed,what in my comment is a rumor facts broke the speakerphone on the nexus the nexus is not on the list in the linked official blog post of devices that will get and is officially end of life on nonsecurity updates were expecting to launch the final release of the android in just a couple of months like the beta it will be available for for pixel pixel xl nexus nexus nexus player and pixel c devices a dev on xda fixed the issue and attributed it to missing lines google forgot to include in an xml file on the official android issue tracker google has set it to priority small and has not acknowledged the problem the fix nor indicated any intention to fix
Android,not_removed,using anything besides dogecoin in
Android,not_removed,magisk hide bro
Android,not_removed,im running lineageos with the su extra and isu with the kernel command patch and android pay works
Android,not_removed,nexus root toolkit is your friend
Android,not_removed,literally the easiest phones to do this on you cant fuck up even if you tried
Android,not_removed,its pretty much impossible to accidently brick a nexus flashing romskernelszips worst case scenario you can always flash a factory image as long as you have at least a working bootloader or recovery
Android,not_removed,only if its unencrypted
Android,not_removed,i know thats why the eol date is october
Android,not_removed,are you kidding me google does years minimum of security updates fact
Android,not_removed,theres an experimental build if you want to dirty flash to lineage you can dirty flash experimental and then dirty flash lineage over it it may or may not work hence the word experimental check your devices xda section to see if its working for your device
Android,not_removed,raven got it there if youre still unclear send me a pm and ill get you sorted
Android,not_removed,oops
Android,not_removed,the bane of my existence is that i just dont like ios the iphone is stupid fast beautiful has tons of accessories and will probably get updates for longer than im alive id buy one but i just prefer android ¯ツ¯ edit to expand on this my personal laptop is also a macbook it sucks having a computer that works so well with ios and just not liking ios the first world is a terrible place
Android,not_removed,you misspelled rxdacirclejerk
Android,not_removed,i know right it was my colleagues when were the smartphone experts in the it department that suggested i get the to be fair its a damn good phone and im glad i didnt get the samsung i doubt the lack of updates will bother me anyways probably
Android,not_removed,fam i will mock anyone who doesnt buy a phone that meets my strict standards step to me with a and ill rip you back to the stoneage 😂😂😂
Android,not_removed,they were the teasing judgemental types office bants and the like
Android,not_removed,is there a reason they didnt include the or
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,damn im sorry to hear that definitely been there though my homies getting better battery life than i ever did with my and i barely even used it just to keep it alive
Android,not_removed,ive had just as bad luck with nougat roms sadly something is keeping the phone awake
Android,not_removed,here is the section where you detail your changes every app designer must use it but were going to just write the same thing every time
Android,not_removed,rxdacirclejerk
Android,not_removed,and the chrome team apparently
Android,not_removed,google switched the method used for night mode the and dont have the hardware support for the new one
Android,not_removed,what would you not like about it seems identical to so far with hopefully a decent amount of bug fixes and optimization
Android,not_removed,just got it to see how ios is hoping to get a job as soon as i finish school to get a pixel
Android,not_removed,o how did you guess 😂😂😂
Android,not_removed,unlucky i bought mine from the google store and they gave me a brand new one keep pushing for it
Android,not_removed,yeah i should have added pixel user here and im pretty excited i love new stuff obviously
Android,not_removed,it still works
Android,not_removed,yeah im a bit confused at what he means updates on windows usually come with a build number thats not so hard to remember google it and theres almost always an official update page
Android,not_removed,unselectable text so you cant even copy that
Android,not_removed,for me at least trusted voice keeps turning itself off nexus when i turn it back on it works for a couple days then turns off
Android,not_removed,theres two separate issues one is that it keeps losing recognition and you have to retain it that has always plagued me recently trusted voice had started turning off for people
Android,not_removed,doesnt work in finnish
Android,not_removed,same here its so annoying when im hella sleepy and trying to set an alarm with my voice
Android,not_removed,same it sucks
Android,not_removed,i pretty much never have my phone in landscape but ive never noticed it
Android,not_removed,huh think you replied to the wrong person
Android,not_removed,hmm i had heard might reduce the battery throttling which has become a real pain on my handset in recent months i guess i will wait until there is a fix for the speaker issue would rather not go custom kernelrom yet as i still like using android pay
Android,not_removed,because the the monthly security updates contain bug fixes saying your speakerphone issue wont be fixed is spreading rumors
Android,not_removed,why i didnt spread a rumor i said i bet thats usually not said before stating a fact but something you believe to be true he said it will stay in this state forever when as a matter of fact will still receive updates not version updates but still updates until sometimes later this year
Android,not_removed,android pay doesnt work on unlocked bootloaders unless magisk updated to spoof that
Android,not_removed,never been able to get it to work on stock rom or pure nexus with chainfires supersu or phhs
Android,not_removed,links
Android,not_removed,no its not training wheels are never going to show you how to properly ride a bike
Android,not_removed,well just dont wipe the efs partition
Android,not_removed,with unlocked bootloader you can flash a custom recovery like twrp and get access to the files despite being encrypted unless im doing something wrong
Android,not_removed,the custom rom scene should remain strong for a while the current favorite over at is pure nexus
Android,not_removed,im in the same boat i used to be all in with iphones though now days i cant even fathom going back to ios
Android,not_removed,not like im not in the same club but ill keep beating that dead horse until it gets updated
Android,not_removed,i was the same way now id say i am mostly ios especially since getting my having a phone that can repeatedly go hours of normal usage is huge the os grows on you and the only thing i can honestly say i really hate is the slow scrolling speed
Android,not_removed,for sure but the updates will make the phone unusably slow after about years
Android,not_removed,this is so wrong i dont even know where to start
Android,not_removed,you have the or the will still get updates till o
Android,not_removed,yes is eol now so and must now get grade treatment as is tradition
Android,not_removed,could still be cooking edit and its still not up hmm 🤔
Android,not_removed,i think they just claimed pixel first durring the beta rollout
Android,not_removed,night mode yet the thread on got marked for a future release that was supposed to be but apparently it isnt in the preview either future seems to be such a generic term for google is september so a rational person would expect the feature sometime before that
Android,not_removed,ram management seems horrible sometimes i open twitter for example switch to facebook go back to twitter and it has to reload
Android,not_removed,yea but thats a completely different topic that im sure everyone will agree on the terms for every google device to date was years of updates ranting that its not fair to only have years of updates when you bought the device knowing those terms is childish
Android,not_removed,how has ios been compared to nougat
Android,not_removed,im more annoyed by the fact that it make a notification after it have finish installing the update to click on to check out what is new only for it to say absolute zero about it considering the last windows update broke my audio drivers some information of what had been updated would have been usefull
Android,not_removed,turns its self off after less than a day for me on my pixel
Android,not_removed,same here my bother and i both have and his trusted voice does not turn it self off off topic kinda but i can control his phone with my voice i guess google thinks im trust worthy
Android,not_removed,dose its turning off there is a post where there is a know work around over is problem
Android,not_removed,ah damnit youre right oh well
Android,not_removed,i said broke the speakerphone on the nexus and that will apparently be its final state emphasis added and until google says it will release an update to a phone that is past its published endoflife date to fix this issue which it has pointedly not done on the issue tracker or in this blog post i dont believe it is a rumor to say that this will apparently be its final state
Android,not_removed,custom kernels are patched for that
Android,not_removed,it did working on my running pn release and elemental x
Android,not_removed,never been able to get it to work even if you did google can at any time make it not work and youd be perpetually be playing the catandmouse game on getting android pay to work then you have to wait on someone to blindly figure out what google changed and make a workaround for that until google blocks that workaround rinse repeat
Android,not_removed,lineageos and the su extra are available at httpsdownloadlineageosorg isu apk and kernel patch are here
Android,not_removed,are you being sarcastic i think hes being sarcastic guys
Android,not_removed,no if theyre encrypted a key is required with or without a custom recovery
Android,not_removed,it should ask for the decryption code unless youre using the default defaultpassword option which it does automatically
Android,not_removed,this was true before apple switched to processors starting at the since then updates have not slowed down their phones i used an iphone and now have a iphone se and the latest updates ios and have only increased performance and battery life
Android,not_removed,nice meme
Android,not_removed,oh im such a twat i have a and misread im going to bed now sleep is required for my ability to read apparently
Android,not_removed,im an idiot
Android,not_removed,day to night soooo smooth and never lags maybe since the wasnt a flagship i feel that much difference but ios has been amazing so far plus battery life is always two days
Android,not_removed,hmmmi think your flair could use some updates 🤔
Android,not_removed,you have to speak more trustworthy obviously
Android,not_removed,and until google says it will release an update to a phone that is past its published endoflife date to fix this issue which it has pointedly not done on the issue tracker or in this blog post i dont believe it is a rumor to say that this will apparently be its final state and thats only because it is google that we have faith if it was anyone else i would not believe them until i see an update until i see it i trust no android oem to keep their promise none of them it pains me to say this but on androidbased phones it is basically were on our own
Android,not_removed,it is not eol it wont be end of life until fall at the earliest it is only eol for features
Android,not_removed,any particular ones
Android,not_removed,thanks for the tip i actually ended up just clean flashing the newest version of pn instead of simply unrooting but letting magisk root on its own worked great plus i live in nyc so there are plenty of places to use android pay d
Android,not_removed,would unrooting via supersu with full unrooting be good enough i was planning on switching to magisk soon
Android,not_removed,dont you know you have to run before you can walk bro s
Android,not_removed,maybe not the best analogy but still i agree with the sentiment the root toolkit is more of a black box since it doesnt expose any of the cli theres not really a smooth way to progress from there to running fastboot commands assuming you want to ride the bike
Android,not_removed,exactly my point people rely on toolkits like the one pointed out here but when they break things because they arent aware of whats actually happening you start getting all these people asking stupid questions instead of being informed on how to use adb properly without the training wheels that this toolkit is
Android,not_removed,fake news i hate that this is reality
Android,not_removed,exactly my point learning how to use abd properly is much more valuable than using a toolkit cause when shit breaks you understand how to fix it
Android,not_removed,i have an encrypted with twrp i dont remember having to provide any key for it to access the files does it happen behind the scenes somehow
Android,not_removed,cool if accurate
Android,not_removed,days damn damn i remember when i had the iphone with a mophie juice pack case back in the day i miss that
Android,not_removed,damn the battery really sucks imo disappointing for a capacity
Android,not_removed,it is only not eol for updates for security issues documented in our public android security bulletins according to the hopefully youre right and they will release a bugfix for the speakerphone they broke in on the nexus however if they do so it will be purely based on googles charity and not based on anything in their support and updates policies
Android,not_removed,franco and elemental works from experience
Android,not_removed,relevance your honor
Android,not_removed,go to the lock screen settings resetup your lock screen and select require to start device without it the device is encrypted but the key is stored
Android,not_removed,gf is pissed because her last longer than the i gave her so yeah that battery sucks
Android,not_removed,move to strike repeatedly
Android,not_removed,ah thanks makes sense now so unless you enable passcode to start device the keys are stored on the device
Android,not_removed,unfortunately were still waiting on sonys binaries for nougat so this is pretty useless unless you dont need a camera
Android,not_removed,these threads usually have a lot of outofdatemisleading comments about the state of the sony aosp program marshmallow is running well at least on kitakami devices series now and i prefer it to stock xperia rom when it comes to general performance and functionality devices are a bit behind when it comes to the camera but pacrom is my daily driver on a compact with mobile camera bluetooth etc working mostly as expected though with certain issues im currently having the following anomalies occasional hiccups with initialising the camera the camera is otherwise alright though with noticeably reduced quality compared to stock the microphone randomly stops working during voip calls this is the most irritating its picky with chargers and quick charge usually doesnt work for me not everyone will accept these faults understandably theyll all be fixedimproved though new binaries will be out within a few days and improve performance further likely for android as well the sources are clean and portable aosp nougat may be usable before the official nougat xperia rom havent compiled and tried it yet its improving on a daily basis additionally a kernel used in the linked instructions is being developed for all supported models from sd and up for android which is unprecedented afaik this program is effective and it does produce great results please dont discount it edit added some words about current issues
Android,not_removed,i wish more manufacturers did like sony in this regard
Android,not_removed,for those interesting in building their own roms ive more success using the sonyaosps fork than the official sony ones the differences are slight but they handle binaries and cherrypicks for you and try to match google pixel ui and apps ive also had better success actually building the rom here are their build instructions httpsgithubcomsonyaospplatformmanifest
Android,not_removed,if i ever buy another non nexuspixel it will probably be a sony phone because of this
Android,not_removed,note that as always these builds dont get you an actually usable stable rom with essential things like telephony missing while their open source support is great for community developers there just isnt much of a developer community left for their phones the latest models have practically nothing going on in the xda boards and the was the last model to be picked up by cm dont buy a sony phone expecting a stable aosp rom
Android,not_removed,you would think that by now android would have a decent hal write drivers once then theyd be available for far longer than needing to compile for every version of android in response to some of the folks here complaining about lack of drivers
Android,not_removed,trying to decide if i want to ride out this aqua until the price on the xz drops or if i want go ahead and grab it this form is the best ive had among mid rangers
Android,not_removed,personal anecdote im using a an xperia xz on stock setting and im missing my running aosp battery life and overall system snappiness was better
Android,not_removed,still have a tmobile xperia sony please unlock my bootloader
Android,not_removed,sony deserves a lot more credit than they receive its because of programs like this concept firmware and beta program that their phones outperform a lot of similar or higher spec hardware
Android,not_removed,if sony are so developerfriendly then why arent there any cm maintainers for their devices
Android,not_removed,and im here with a with no
Android,not_removed,is site saying you can use the binaries for nougat or that you need to start with the binaries then go to the nougat ones
Android,not_removed,is this site saying that this is how we can build a full rom for my so that im not stuck on the developer preview
Android,not_removed,what will happen the camera wont work at all
Android,not_removed,people here are actually praising sony but im never buying a sony phone again camera is already not that great and any aospbased roms make them unusable these instructions are useless if the proprietary camera stuff isnt released or made usable
Android,not_removed,thanks for the informative post can you comment on the status of aosp for the x series specifically im considering an x compact for my so
Android,not_removed,do these roms contain the official camera app or its just some crappy version with the nice processing algorithms removed also have you tried this rom everything works the site says its a stable release
Android,not_removed,does the fingerprint scanner work at all i compiled for my but never installed it because i read it doesnt work
Android,not_removed,yep sony and nexus are the only ones that really do it i think oneplus might provide device trees too
Android,not_removed,i literally bought an x performance a few minutes ago so this is nice im sick of the giant screen on my going for something waaaay smaller and sony phones have always looked beautiful to me so lets see how it is only thing im pissed about is returning to micro usb i love usb c so much
Android,not_removed,yeah i really should have bought an xz instead of the htc i love the quality of sony software and hardware i havent had the pleasure of stock android though
Android,not_removed,after the pixel announcement i got the xperia x compact and i love it has everything i want on a phone and you cant beat the price its also water resistant although not officially
Android,not_removed,but imagine android was just a generic rom and all companies selling android devices just simply released drivers for the camera soc etc and if your hardware could handle it you could just install the latest android instead we have a wealth of devices on the market that will never be updated not only is the current update model extremely inconvenient it leaves devices with known security holes remaining active
Android,not_removed,why these builds are useless as daily driver they dont speed up the custom rom development and the moment you unlock the bootloader the camera is borked that coupled with the intermittent hardware issues made me switch away from sony
Android,not_removed,youre saying you got better battery life from a device running an just because of sonys additions to aosp thats crazy
Android,not_removed,did chrome feel snappier though
Android,not_removed,did you build it yourself aosp for could i get a link there is only one thread over on xda and it hasnt been updated in a month now the latest build gave me terrible battery life sot and would crash every so often
Android,not_removed,sony no lol
Android,not_removed,i miss my still have it its on my desk but the battery started expanding so sad that phone was great
Android,not_removed,unlock it yourself
Android,not_removed,their support in this manner is garbage it barely works if at all at least ime on my
Android,not_removed,poor product availability in markets that many cm maintainers reside in usa
Android,not_removed,that phone is three years old consider upgrading to something more recent perhaps edit yeahhh i get the downvotes but if the guy wanted updates for years he shouldve gotten an iphone
Android,not_removed,image processing ends up using some boilerplate methods rather than those coded specifically for the camera which results in shitty lowlight images and overall reduced performance iirc
Android,not_removed,as of last month the camera fails to start the majority of the time if you do get it to start the preview is borked but the actual image comes out fine im in the process of building now so it might be better image processing itself was fixed in the binaries its just that fails to initialize the camera of the time edit must state doesnt have the initialization issue and is more reliable
Android,not_removed,aosp has stable camera support doesnt though i havent tested it in a month ive seen some updates done recently for the camera spurces for and have yet to test it its my suspicion that sony will completely abandon stock builds and move to aospaddons within years i wouldnt recommend it for anybody who doesnt like messing with their devices but i do wish sony realized theres a good market for aosplike devices
Android,not_removed,camera hal is open source httpsgithubcomsonyxperiadevcamera the actual camera binary blobs are closed source
Android,not_removed,me too ive done a bunch of the z line but my is the last one
Android,not_removed,pretty sure youll have to use google camera or an alternative with any aosp rom the last time i saw sonys camera ported was from the and required a lot of additional frameworkjs changes impossible to do without setting aside a good chunk of your time
Android,not_removed,buy the xperia xz with usb c
Android,not_removed,i love usb c so much why after a year now with usb c its nothing but a huge pain in the ass this early in the game ive had to buy everything from chargers to cables and car chargers to accomdate the new life and there is no advantage to show for it years from today it will be good currently its just a hassle try traveling with it
Android,not_removed,why did you buy an x performance when the xz is out
Android,not_removed,sonys hardware is always gorgeous has been since the original z the glass on glass no camera bump rectangular slab is really nice
Android,not_removed,had it not for the £ price difference my would have been an xperia xz still not ready to say goodbye to my though trying to think of a good use for it other than backup
Android,not_removed,that would stuck every nonstock is haz way more features than stock
Android,not_removed,maybe if android were based on an os that didnt break binary compatibility all the time we could still use the original drivers under the updated os
Android,not_removed,it might be because the aosp is more aggressive with cpu management than sony i gave my wife my old on when a notification comes in the sound plays at lower than producing this extremely slowed down audio i would suspect its because their aosp build drops the cpu frequency very low when the screen is off i will concede im comparing marshmallow to nougat but yeah i know its vs
Android,not_removed,i did build it myself but i just wiped it since im building against the branch now ill upload it to google drive and send you a link when i finish it its a bit of a hassle to build since i need to reboot my pc into ubuntu since building via windows bash simply doesnt work
Android,not_removed,what made you realize that the battery was expanding
Android,not_removed,digitizer just went on mine had to give it back to telus but they gave me a new in return is nice but i do miss that sexy
Android,not_removed,its not unlockable at least no one has come out with an unlock method
Android,not_removed,what barely works im legitimately asking i cant speak for aosp because i havent tried it but their concept firmware is great ive owned a nexus and various xperias including and xz and every major release iphone from and sonys beta programs have always been the best experience im probably going to get downvoted for this but its true ive been running their concept marshmallow firmware on my since it was leaked and have had great support along the way giving them feedback is easy via their app or the forums ive always receive a reply from sony within hours on the support forums and suggestions are often addressed in upcoming firmware versions also the ability to choose between weekly updates or monthly rollups and being able to switch between the two without losing your data is a much better experience than running beta firmware on the nexus most nexus updates would breaks something like your battery life and ive never once received a reply from google all of sonys beta firmware could easily be your daily driver without any sacrifice tldr sony beta nexus beta ios beta in terms of user experience sony is engaging with their user base the others arent ps i wasnt the one that downvote you
Android,not_removed,the was pretty popular in the usa and has crap support because roms on sony devices are stupid hard
Android,not_removed,this sounds so strange the was released at the same time as the iphone for the same price imagine the shitstorm everywhere on reddit and the web if apple cut the support now for it
Android,not_removed,so no different to the stock camera then
Android,not_removed,hmm camera support for my is utterly broken on aosp as well
Android,not_removed,but does aosp have the same drivers as the official rom or just some placeholder crap
Android,not_removed,i had the same thinking before i switched to one plus trust me the grass seems greener on the other side i dont see any benefits of switching now camera sources still released for
Android,not_removed,not the x performance tho
Android,not_removed,because its one port for everything ideally i have a pixel c chromebook pixel dell venue pro tablet and now xperia xz i can charge my phone or tablet with my laptop charger all my laptop accessories i bought usb hub hdmi adapter usbc to usba usbc to ethernet etc work on all my devices usbc to usbc means i can also charge one device with another sap battery from my tablet to charge my phone and vice versa also the port is reversible and has a sturdier snap than microusb
Android,not_removed,online you can get converter tips by the boatload and just stick em on the end of your microusb cables like i did then you only really need to have or actual usb c cables laying round until the shift becomes even greater
Android,not_removed,dont sound like you have a sony i rarely charge mine
Android,not_removed,i like how they make some of the few phones that dont look like theyre toys
Android,not_removed,randroid on the xz bezels are too big resolution is too low battery is too small design is too boring price is too high randroid on the last year screen resolution doesnt matter dxo mark score doesnt mean anything randroid on the pixel bezels are fine resolution is good enough battery size is great design doesnt matter noone needs front firing speakerswaterproofingexpandable storage dxo best camera ever price take my money
Android,not_removed,rectangular slab in contrast to
Android,not_removed,ive heard their cameras arent as good is that true i also heard they use a plastic lens cover prone to scratching
Android,not_removed,os that didnt break binary compatibility all the time so why is this happening with android
Android,not_removed,xz has an has the
Android,not_removed,gotcha thank you so much how did you build the rom ive been thinking of trying my hand at this for a while now
Android,not_removed,have you had any luck building worked for me and ive been running it for a month or so on my tablet wifi but the build failed there seems to be a conflict with the prebuilt and opensource versions of qualcomm location and im not sure how to resolve that
Android,not_removed,yeahhhhhhhhhhhh i need to dispose of it
Android,not_removed,it got really really warm while charging and the screen started to separate from the phone no bueno
Android,not_removed,concept roms are ok but still have sony skin iirc i wanted aosp which they release stuff for but the builds dont work no camera fingerprint sensor etc and aospa builds dont have working cameras plus the bootloader is super funky so we have like no dev support
Android,not_removed,it was released in september the same time as the iphone
Android,not_removed,thats the only thing i hate about sony and why im scared to pull the trigger on the xz their updates are just garbage especially if it is carrier branded had a tmobile and waiting to get updates was an eternity decided to get an unlocked international and although i do miss band throwing a custom rom on it really is more enjoyable than whatever sonys plan with the tmo was
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,aosp doesnt use any of sonys drm protected image processing libs so it wouldnt have any effect
Android,not_removed,the issue isnt the processing its the initialization image processing was fixed somewhere around late august somebody uploaded a sample shot on xda im not sure if it has the extra bionz post processing though personally i dont like how stock dithers the images and blurssmears pixels together personally i have something closer to raw than post processing
Android,not_removed,depending on the price you want to pay but the xz might be the more future proof purchase i went with teh x compact and its a dream phone for me
Android,not_removed,how often you need to charge isnt related to what type of usb youre using
Android,not_removed,i shattered my back because i left it on a slightly inclined surface i turned to put away my coat and heard a splat the back was shattered to pieces the xz isnt nearly as slippery with its metal surface i can rest it on my leather couch at degrees or so and it wont slip my infamously slid off it all the time
Android,not_removed,unless your putting it down on a completely flat surface that thing starts slipping down the quickest route it can find to the floor great way to find out if the towel draped over the side of ones bathtub is completely smooth also helps determine if the bathtub is level hahahaha the xperia l might be slow and old but that curved rubber back will never let the phone dump itself on the floor
Android,not_removed,that used to bother me about the although at least with that you had the charging dock to plop it in if you were at home but anywhere else and the phone would just slide around on flat surfaces until it found its way to the floor i went and got some grippy tray liner from the local autoaccessory story its a thin neoprene like material and have one at my bedside table and one at my desk at work worked great with no case until the rear adhesive died due to excessive heat cycles and the rear panel started to fall off
Android,not_removed,compared to other phones samsung apple nexus and now pixel the corners arent rounded see i personally like it the xz has a somewhat flattened cylindrical shape to it
Android,not_removed,i couldnt get to build because i rely on sonyaosps fork and their fork is incomplete i did build with the new binaries and forced the camera to to get it somewhat working though not as good as with
Android,not_removed,i agree the status of the bootloader is pretty crap but the sony customisations on the concept firmwares are a lot lighter than their stock roms which are already light to begin with i dont have my here to refer to lent it to a friend whos now in love with it but iirc the concept firmware even had aosp dialer ill have to find my and give aosp a try ive never unlocked the bootloader on an xperia before
Android,not_removed,oh yes i was mistaken by a year still the outcry would be huge
Android,not_removed,sony doesnt get a say with carrierbranded phones nor do they have a say in what googles cts will be next year or the very next week or qualcomms support if you want to dig that far its just one of those things where having multiple hands in the pot leads to a horribletasting stew at times
Android,not_removed,buying a carrier branded phone is a stupid decision no matter what whatever sonys plan for your variant was the carrier has ultimate authority while the official updates for my may have been a little slow they were rock solid and a device that shipped with got an official rom and how many manufacturers can you say that about
Android,not_removed,it has stock qualcomm camera hal and chromatix tunings no chokoball and excal libs to handle post processing like on stock since theyre sony proprietary libs some think initialisation might have something to do with selection ill be having a look on the weekend
Android,not_removed,haha yeah i had this problem with the just when you thought the surface was level the would prove you wrong sometimes itd take minutes or so to fall off the couch but it always did
Android,not_removed,and thatll actually work too just build a small raft out of twigs and wood and sacrifice a charger
Android,not_removed,ah thanks with the correction info
Android,not_removed,i hate seeing these theyre both great phones its personal preference and up to the user neither one is truly better than the other
Android,not_removed,while this is true the screen and camera is undebatable better on the and for me personally these are among the top things i seek in a smartphone
Android,not_removed,i agree however i would say htc deserves the sales more than samsung samsung is samsung they really havent surprised anyone for years and since they are so big they can afford cheaper bulk buys and more rd htc however has been struggling and now theyve hit a home run but youll be hard pressed to see any htc hype outside of the internet which is sad considering it is such a good phone
Android,not_removed,i really think the has better battery life camera display performance ergonomicslooks and the addition of water resistantce heartbeat sensor and expandable storage do make it the better phone overall
Android,not_removed,you should consider that htc was the largest once htc has billions in the bank now theyre not too poor to afford rd oneplus arent selling their phones at a loss despite the price while limiting volume using invites so you see that volume is not the issue here edit all i mean is just get the best phone for your needs if you like sound quality very much or cant get an exynos phone htc is the best option never ever buy a phone just because the manufacturer is struggling why punish yourself for their mistakes
Android,not_removed,struggling cause of their own fault and i wouldnt call it a home run id say they are on the right track again but everyone has their own opinion
Android,not_removed,htc doesnt even come close to the amount of money samsung can spend on rd
Android,not_removed,this and the camera htc knows their cameras were not quite the best in their last three phones they should have spent more money into the camera software if the main difference between the and the was the screen slcd vs samoled and the metal body whoever wanted a metal phone would have overlooked the screen but now the camera is quirky in some reviews has better pictures in others worse the autofocus is not as good as samsungs the lcd screen is not quite as bright as the amoled so people overlook sense and go for the i would have liked an but i could not find in in any store in my city and recently the has seen lowered prices by the equivalent of
Android,not_removed,agreed lower the price htc
Android,not_removed,same here has seen a drop htc is keeping the very expensive especially on contracts
Android,not_removed,samsung also manufactures components for others whatever samsung invests also benefits other oems look at finfet for example pretty sure htc has much more advanced metalworking facilities than anyone due to how long theyve been using metal in their builds sony probably invests a lot in their sensor division yet their rivals use their sensors more effectively than them
Android,not_removed,the one was borderline worse than the

Android,not_removed,what a cheesy title
Android,not_removed,a cpu that wont overheat yeah lets wait and see about that we didnt think would overheat and it did we thought that kryo would fix the overheating issue and yet were still seeing some problems
Android,not_removed,idea from someone with no knowledge in cpu architecture put in of the same cpus in one device far away from each other the first does all the main work when the first starts to get hot hand the main workload over to the second the first goes idle or lowactivity to cool down when the second gets hot hand the load over to the first and so on and on and on qualcomm call me to seal the deal
Android,not_removed,sounds like the governor used in the xaomi for the masses love that governors are getting attention on desktop and mobile platforms
Android,not_removed,its important to note that moving to a smaller process doesnt solve cooling a smaller chip has less surface area to transfer heat which is pretty inconvenient for cooling this is apparently going to be using less power so maybe that will make up for it
Android,not_removed,wait did the snapdragon not fix the overheating issues present in the
Android,not_removed,the only thing right about this post is the first sentence
Android,not_removed,the problem here is the swapping is quite costly and also most phones are designed to disperse the heat from the cpu throughout the whole phone so this wouldnt really help much
Android,not_removed,how to double the price of a phone
Android,not_removed,oneplus actually did something like this with the in the opt their governor ensures as much as possible that when more than one of the are in use they are not the ones that are beside each other
Android,not_removed,another problem with this is that it will take twice the amount of space in the phone precious space that could be filled with battery instead of a redundant cpu also having two cpus means you need to power both cpus even if theyre not really doing anything they still draw power and will now be drawing twice as much power even while idle
Android,not_removed,among other problems what would you do when theyre both hot
Android,not_removed,you know a cpu gets hot and throttles in seconds
Android,not_removed,from what i understand its much better than the but still not there
Android,not_removed,not if they dynamically throttle over to the othe cpu but on that note throttle the socs to workload and use both no heat problems and increase performance
Android,not_removed,because a mobile smartphone snapdragon cpu costs anywhere between dollar no
Android,not_removed,but is tiny the cpu part probably takes like so it doesnt really matter which cores youre using the whole chip will still heat up
Android,not_removed,you could also use that space for a heat sink or something still keeps it cool but without the crazy overhead of a second cpu
Android,not_removed,the idea was to let one cool down while the other does the work and gets hot when the working cpu gets hot the other had cooled down so they can switch workloads
Android,not_removed,mortal kombat x starts to stutter after minutes on my
Android,not_removed,with modern cpus the time it takes the electrons to move across the wire can be a bottleneck as wikipedia states a computer built with parts connected by half this distance centimetres in of wire would take at least a nanosecond to send data to a part and get a response httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinanosecond given that modern cpus have a clock cycle of ghz we only have of a nanosecond to work with that means the maximum distance the electrons can go is inches so if you put your cpus on opposite sides of a phone youre already limiting the speed of the cpu in ghz and thats before you account for all the actual computation that happens im grossly oversimplifying already but the tldr is that you cant put the cores far apart as for the handover between two perfectly good cpu i dont even know where to start lets just say there would be issues
Android,not_removed,youre not just doubling the cost of the soc but all the mainboard components needed to drive and support the soc it would be a big increase in cost as well as a big increase in the size of the mainboard requiring either a larger device or less room for batterycomponents
Android,not_removed,nah a newly released soc is like max a last gen soc is more like
Android,not_removed,without active cooling heatsink will be just a heat conductor heat wont dissipate faster
Android,not_removed,thats a lot of information for just a casual comment then again servers are build like this to scale so i cant see to much over head problems if its designed for it and there both based in linux kernel same as these servers so the tech is there
Android,not_removed,not saying its a great idea or anything but couldnt you use something with a very high heat capacity that way youre essentially taking energy out of the system
Android,not_removed,i just thought id explain it i was on the bus and had too much time on my hands parallel processing what server farms do is a different topic you know how cores isnt times faster than core this would just make the problem worse it could be a little faster i cant say for sure that it wouldnt but im sure intelqualcomm etc are doing their research and have looked into things like this
Android,not_removed,the way it works right now is heat is displaced everywhere and you could call your whole phone one big heatsink in its current state everything cools down your phone slightly in a low temperature room something like or less phones stop throttling
Android,not_removed,but its not a fake remote control if it actually works
Android,not_removed,moto z play love the battery and moto mods
Android,not_removed,nvidia shield sure it had a recall for the battery but they replaced it very quickly in the end that thing has lasted me for years of reading and note taking now its running as my mobile dev environment thanks to the magic of multirom heck that thing has lasted longer than any laptop ive used in that time
Android,not_removed,nexus
Android,not_removed,nexus cheap durable good performance for the money and it got lots of updates
Android,not_removed,just got an this week after using the for years god damn i love this thing although some of the changes i do not like and take some getting used to
Android,not_removed,the edge exynos is the first phone ive been completely happy with i dont like the samsung launcher but nova takes care of that its the first time a software update nougat beta has genuinely increased the battery life on a phone ive owned too
Android,not_removed,my og moto x is still my favorite phone if it werent stuck on lollipop id still be using it today
Android,not_removed,my best experience was probably with the moto x or my current phone htc honestly though theyve all had a but this is my android phone history og motorola droid cool because it was my first smartphone keyboard was great but it was laggy and i was plagued by home screen redraws all the time galaxy nexus loved ics and felt that android finally was rivaling ios in smoothness but it lasted like hours total moto x amazing form factor and great software features but i was stuck with a rearfacing speaker poor camera and a locked bootloader on verizon moto x even better software features had a model so i had more space than before nice color options but bad battery life and form factor that was a tad too wide and topheavy compact finally a phone that fit in my pockets but speakers were too soft and it was uncomfortable to hold and a tiny bit too small for me i prefer but that doesnt exist anymore and for some reason i just found it boringi cant explain why because the htc which is similar on paper is way more exciting to me htc beautiful design great speakers and smooth performance but its a bit too big lacks amoled and doesnt have an alwayson voice detection feature like my old moto x devices
Android,not_removed,sony xperia great screen long lasting battery water resistant native dualshock support it lasted me two years with absolutely no issues at all
Android,not_removed,htc one software updates to marshmallow sd card slot ir port everything was smooth and worked great
Android,not_removed,my nexus and nvidia shield tv which is goddam glorious
Android,not_removed,the first of my current phones xiaomi mi plus performance design and build all the others other xiaomi phones xperia galaxy a couple of early iphones have had some bigger or smaller thing that wasnt quite right
Android,not_removed,nexus still using mine daily after nearly years
Android,not_removed,compact i got that phone basically a month after it came out two years later it still flies with everyday activities water resistance expandable storage minimal bezels front facing speakers camera is not the greatest but other than that phones been great even after using it for two years i still get about a day of heavy usage talking sot plus music play in background
Android,not_removed,galaxy note pros speed doesnt feel slow at all after having it for almost years great camera it was fucking amazing when it came out and can still take some amazing picture but by no means is it the best anymore screen the screen is a great size and i would want to go any smaller or bigger though when i did it people were amazed at how big it was touchwizsoftware ive slapped on nova launcher and made it look exactly the same is it was before its just got some extra features that are pretty handy overall ive got nothing to complain about touchwiz it got some handy features i dont really use many of them removable back now this one is very handy as my battery ended up getting fucked so i just went an boughtwithout having send the phone away to get it fixed super duper handy battery its pretty good and can sometimes last the whole day if i dont end up using it that much thought it could be a little cons figure print scanner this one is horrible and im glad the fixed it on the onwards making it so you dont slide your figure which is a pain in the ass
Android,not_removed,sony xperia my current phone never had an issue does everything i need it to do
Android,not_removed,nexus switched to project fi and dont have any carrier bloatware ive always got service and this phone just seems to do everything i throw at it only complaint i could have is that its too thin and feels like it would bend easy if i left it in the wrong pocket
Android,not_removed,the note ii for the vast rom support and i suppose the oneplus which is my primary device now
Android,not_removed,its been a while since i used android ive made a return with the moto after using mostly windows phones and before that i was an apple fan although my moto is not the best device available it does out perform my lumia i didnt realise how slow the actually is and apple bored the hell out of me there were also many apps force closing on ios which is something that hasnt happened to me yet on android ive had my for four months now and i still cant find anything to fault it
Android,not_removed,samsung edge
Android,not_removed,my motox dropped that thing more times than i can count dropped it in a pool and it still worked as good as the day i bought it i only got rid of it a couple months ago because i wanted a phone with more memory but i have fond memories of my motox i wish i still had it for a backup
Android,not_removed,just got a moto coming from samsungs and an old xperia its amazing so fast and stock android is great
Android,not_removed,nexus nexus google pixel
Android,not_removed,my htc one its just so beautiful
Android,not_removed,samsung nexus s replaceable battery big display good performance at the time better storage situation it was such a huge step up from all phones before in terms of quality user experience everything really especially with having had storage phones from htc before it was my best experience even though of course as soon as dual core or higher phones came out it was outdated
Android,not_removed,to be honest my nexus running nougat is the best android experience i have ever had a lot of people are having battery issues but theres a huge silent majority like me that doesnt
Android,not_removed,both previous and current xperia x ive been running sonys concept software on both for longer than stock sony rom and i really like the experience
Android,not_removed,never had a better phone than my current phone xiaomi fast miui is amazing with the features packed in good camera for the price i dont ask for anything else
Android,not_removed,perfect size splendid battery life and the legendary i just wish it didnt have a glass back
Android,not_removed,nexus
Android,not_removed,droid incredible started a love for android that would last forever for me
Android,not_removed,xperia xz feels like the most polished android device ive ever handled and doesnt even wake up the desire of rooting it or anything like that screen is great speakers are great especially the one for phone calls the stock rom is rockstable has no unkillable bloat almost as fast as ios and is very consistent in its resource consumption and sony launcher is perfect for me camera is able to produce photos which look great on a fhd monitor in almost any conditions although you have to be handy with manual settings for that with always spoton af and colors battery life is plenty enough for me around days or hours of sot with either wifi or active at all times i just hope it will remain that way for as long as possible
Android,not_removed,honor people are sleeping on this device imo
Android,not_removed,my nexus was fantastic until it bootlooped days ago
Android,not_removed,and
Android,not_removed,nexus by far i came from an and the nexus was amazing in fact even though i switched to a note about months ago i was having so many issues with it that ive switched back my nexus its been magical outside of the low battery cpu throttle
Android,not_removed,the most dependable android device i ever owned was my motorola atrix original not hd the screen was pretty lowres qhd but it was packed with features fingerprint scanner in hdmi out great performance and build quality the processor never stuttered in any game i threw at it im still salty it never got ics
Android,not_removed,i went from a samsung galaxy s to an that was pretty crazy my was perfect but the screen broke so i was forced to upgrade i tried a note and pixel and the note was my overall favorite device unfortunately it was too sluggish compared to the and pixel so im using the pixel right for the time being since its so fluid the note and both have issues with gps and my pixels service cuts out randomly sometimes too though so none of them are perfect once the note comes out ill probably switch to that and be done with it
Android,not_removed,love my note first time i had a new phone for more than months without getting frustrated about something year later and much the same
Android,not_removed,as much hate as it gets here i really enjoy my pixel xl my biggest thing with this phone is battery life and it blows me away with how long it can last with my old i would have to plug in halfway through the day but with the pixel i dont find myself doing that at all
Android,not_removed,ive had a nexus sony lg and now a galaxy the samsung is a clear winner premium price but a premium phone
Android,not_removed,this phone makes it really hard for me to justify upgrading it runs super smooth and has decent battery life with my extra battery i never run out of juice and my grados sound great on it my fiances moto z play is also pretty awesome its buttery smooth and it just wont die she never ends a day with than percent of her battery
Android,not_removed,both of my current devices are excellent in their own ways i love my mi max for its big screen long battery life miuis useful features and frequent software updates and i love my new yoga book for its flexibility
Android,not_removed,was the beast i was hoping it would be and served me well for years i got the nexus basically on clearance for xmas i didnt need a tablet and this is doing everything i could possibly want at a fraction of the cost of what i could have paid
Android,not_removed,my current phone galaxy active has nailed everything i wanted in a smartphone i used to use phones with replaceable batteries since im not home often the battery life on this phone is double that of what id get from previous phones with a spare battery lg active note note and its also great theres no compromise to the specs of this phone has the same camera and processor of the original just with a bigger battery and beefier build id love it if other manufacturers did the same with their flagships
Android,not_removed,galaxy s
Android,not_removed,i only recently switched from apple but the axon has treated me very nicely and i am happy with my decision
Android,not_removed,the entire note line ive had every one other than the and theyve all been gorgeous powerful phones that were a joy to use the note was by far my favorite it had every feature i want and is still just as good as most of the new phones out there i loved it so much in fact that i bought another one last night i had the moto z force for about months and it was a nice phonephenomenal battery but i found myself missing the note features way too much
Android,not_removed,oneplus coming from a nexus i was right at home with pretty close to vanilla experience great performance awesome battery life and decent software updates i still prefer a smaller phone with screen but barring that i dont have a single complaint with this one running nougat beta now with open beta no plans to update to stable builds as i guess beta channel will get first
Android,not_removed,motorola droid it was a remarkable device and when heavily overclocked running launcherpro was genuinely fantastic
Android,not_removed,the one plus three has been a great device it has worked flawlessly
Android,not_removed,i no longer use it but my note never slowed down a bit over the years i had it my moto x play is rock solid as well
Android,not_removed,moto g lte cheap great battery lifedisplayreception android stock portable it lacks of a good camera but i dont care about that for it was one of my best tech deals ever and im still using it
Android,not_removed,oneplus and thats coming from a
Android,not_removed,my moto x was a fantastic device i still give it praise when speaking about it my has been pretty good too overall
Android,not_removed,nexus for my usage it was perfect camera was on point fast enough for most things front facing speakers easy to hold
Android,not_removed,htc incredible sits unbelievable that it still runs perfectly after so many yearsyeah its still on ics but works great had some issues over yearsbut interestingly enough they repaired themselves after days so yeahthats my best experience
Android,not_removed,xperia xz hands down the best device ive ever used theres no bloat its all stock images are amazing and i can easily offload to the microsd so i dont have to resort to lower res shots its also the first phone i havent tinkered with all my other samsung phones ive flashed custom roms to get rid of bloat or ugliness my xz still has its locked bootloader which is an absolute first for me since all the way upto galaxy the i used to have sucked because of the and all its throttling i kept flashing custom roms and kernels but was never satisfied also the camera was worse but the new rgbcir red green blue clear infrared sensor on the xz fixed my low light issues
Android,not_removed,i agree the made me switch from the iphone the was fucking awesome with the speaker ir blaster and htc sense just sucked that mine got fucked up
Android,not_removed,note in white it was the perfect phone imo
Android,not_removed,pretty much every android phone i had some issue none of them were stable nexus had crappy battery galaxy note had crappy ui galaxy had severe lag lg had crappy battery redmi note had crappy software cm and miui both had so many problems lg had crappy battery my current phone is the galaxy and the battery life is kinda unstable it depends what day it is also not a phone but i had a galaxy tab a and it bootlooped tbh the iphone was the most problem free phone ive ever had battery lasted the whole day ui looked good and it never lagged
Android,not_removed,nexus man that phone was perfect
Android,not_removed,nexus was my first which i loved but the nexus remains the smoothest phone ive ever used just so snappy and responsive i didnt have the best luck with the power button going on the two i owned but software wise its the best
Android,not_removed,redmi note i can run a very stable build at a budget price i dont care about camera given the price the development forum is awesome like maybe nexus awesome
Android,not_removed,my current phone xiaomi is great super fast display is great a good enough camera and overall a great looking phone i upgraded from an htc one and havent looked back was a good little phone but i just didnt like the screen size camera
Android,not_removed,i would say coming from the one i have the best experience with the edge right now as this phone has almost everything you coud wish for and even more i am glad that the experience will be even better great job with the line up all i can say
Android,not_removed,original droid x
Android,not_removed,htc one and now the moto z have yet to find a problem with the z
Android,not_removed,galaxy i know beat it on all front but still this design language first attracted me towards samsung smartphones in general using it for years and yet to find a problem waiting for whatever samsung comes up with note in
Android,not_removed,i remember just how wowed i was going from a budget android phone to the that phone had and still has everything i want in a phone and was just an overall great phone additionally i loved upgrading to my after had a premium feel decent headphone jack audio quality good dev support although i found its camera to be a downgrade from the still a phone im glad i got to use regardless
Android,not_removed,started with a one x moved on to note nexus and currently nexus each was better than the one before all were at least fine
Android,not_removed,my lg optimus one and nexus one i still have the nexus and that trackball still works
Android,not_removed,so far the best device ive had was probably my im hoping that changes when i receive my pixel xl though
Android,not_removed,nexus on mahdi rom
Android,not_removed,nexus still use it today for games and misc it was a very consistent phone
Android,not_removed,galaxy nexus and one plus one
Android,not_removed,moto is amazing its dirt cheap and you get a decently fast phone with a inch screen also the bootloader is very easily unlockable i just wish i went with the plus instead of the standard i didnt realize the standard one came without a fast charger and i realize how useful a fingerprint scanner would be
Android,not_removed,the edge first amoled display looks great and them blacks mmmmm
Android,not_removed,htc one gpe
Android,not_removed,sony xperia play my first smartphone all android phones were shit back then but looking back on it it performed well and allowed me to play snes and gba games easily and with a quality experience sony compact back to sony after a few years i loved having a small phone and the performance and build were excellent it ran rings around other android devices from the same time period even years later showed me firsthand that samsung software was shit moto z play my daily driver is now a pixel but i use the moto z play for music games and heavy dickaround browsing the battery is insane the performance is barely different from the pixel and the display is warm and colorful and i love the speaker mod the projector got some surprising use watching netflix in bed while cuddling with the gf projected on the cielling and with a bluetooth speaker way better than a couch
Android,not_removed,htc one was a great device that i couldnt stop using when i got it then it was the htc this year which is still my all time favorite device and now the pixel which is the smoothest phone ive ever had
Android,not_removed,i liked xperia the most the software was really well made sound quality over bluetooth was unmatched by any other phone ive owned after the battery was great i could easily get hours sot good microphone and the size was good too now i own a and it kinda sucks i see where they cut the costs the antennas are awful they put the worst microphone available on the market no aptx and more
Android,not_removed,galaxy nexus nexus pixel xl
Android,not_removed,not technically an android device but the was solid for me i finally had to get a new phone when the usb port went out the lg was also great for me currently on the moto x and its solid as well
Android,not_removed,my blackberry priv has been really impressing me everytime i use i am impressed with it and i have had it for over a year now
Android,not_removed,original moto g
Android,not_removed,used far too many over the years to really remember so only posting very recent ones edge exynos it was my first samsung phone directly from the note days i went completely to the iphone from there really no complaints about this phone at all till i used it it was from work it was smooth battery life was amazing the display something to die for and the camera afaik was and is still one of the best overall solutions around the phone delivered at every level oneplus this was bought on a lark i had little intention of really keeping it however its grown on me like the proverbial fungus they have been steadily adding features to it its multitasking is really smooth and i just enjoy using it lag is non existent and battery life is great the camera is not quality but its right up there with anything released last year the pixel xl what do i even say about this use this for a few days and every other android phone feels like a sluggish tortoise battery life is stellar apps just fly and even after putting gb of music and apps its still responsive like nothing i have ever seen on android
Android,not_removed,i really liked the original droid turbo verizon only it had a great battery nice screen some cool features and the rubberized coating was awesome the had the best camera ive ever had on android the for beautiful screen using iphone now hahaha biggest factor being battery optimization
Android,not_removed,ive been a long time iphone user and recently said fuck their controlling ways and switched to android i was going to wait for the galaxy to come out but i couldnt wait any longer so i bought a used note to hold me over so far i love it its wayyyy better than any iphone ive used and i dont know why i didnt make the jump sooner
Android,not_removed,droid turbo perfect performance before lollipop never lagged and always had insane battery life camera was amazing it had capacitive buttons which i prefer over onscreen front facing speaker excellent software never overheated great screen fast charging and did i mention battery life nexus the few months great performance latest software holo blue from android jellybean good battery life very affordable but then the touchscreen issues hit it
Android,not_removed,my nexus best phone ive had only thing i wish is that the battery would be as good on nougat as it was on marshmellow
Android,not_removed,galaxy nexus was the shit
Android,not_removed,i remember getting the google developer edition of nexus one it came with a special google branded sleeve and was sent to me for free from google as recognition of my early development contributions ive misplaced both the phone and sleeve now though unforutnately a close second would be the which was my first ever android device
Android,not_removed,samsung infuse was my first real android device great screen huge for the time performed well all the way up to
Android,not_removed,the vizio tablet that came with my tv battery lasts about a week and performs well
Android,not_removed,the lg was a great phone i always loved the camera
Android,not_removed,i had an amazing time with my nexus that thing impressed me so much and i spent a lot of time with custom roms and kernels etc i also loved my htc one x maybe more than the but i had weird mobile signal issues with att and the bug they finally discovered was marked as will not fix
Android,not_removed,nexus beautiful screen excellent rom support huge but i loved it now i have a shitty moto x pure that feels depressing
Android,not_removed,nexus
Android,not_removed,my galaxy which i am using right now is fantastic it just has so many cool features that even some new phones dont have the screen is beautiful and i just this new years cracked the screen after almost two years of no case and i do not have good hand eye coordination
Android,not_removed,oneplus one see absolutely no reason to upgrade it atm
Android,not_removed,went from xperia arc to lg i was blown away still using my lg 🎈
Android,not_removed,nexus one and nexus were both awesome i just wish they had better battery lives nexus has a great camera and is fast most of the times but i frequently face lag not only when the phone overheats but also during simple tasks like dialing a phone number also has some connectivity issues mainly volte doesnt working with jio network in india
Android,not_removed,sony xperia great specs battery life features clean fast os waterproof etc
Android,not_removed,all time has to be the galaxy note it was well ahead of its time for a display of ramand a specs were amazing most recently huawei honor got it to test out a budget phone on amazon for i am seriously impressed by this little device the performance is great battery life is ridiculous hours and the camera is decent the only reason im returning the phone is due to intermittent push message delays
Android,not_removed,ive never had an android phone that lasted me over hours sot average until i got the moto z play this gets me hours average and easily lasts me days absolutely mind blowing
Android,not_removed,htc ultimate beast having all sort of different os rom nexus s or galaxy but faulty gps hardware the phone that sparked up cyanogenmod moto g first gen is impressive fuelsaver oneplus one is a great release alongside with caf source put into shame oneplus dont need to explain much these are the best android phones that shows me the true customizability of android ecosystem
Android,not_removed,moto x play which is my current one ive havent yet found an issue with this phone also lg this phone was a beast when i bought it back in even when it got horrible blotches in the screen maybe due to overheat it was a really good phone
Android,not_removed,lg i loved that thing id still be happy to daily one
Android,not_removed,the galaxy was amazing for its time
Android,not_removed,yes the gpe is my favorite android phone ever
Android,not_removed,ive had the lg and theyve been great companions for me ive loved them more than any other device ive ever owned
Android,not_removed,moto incredible rom support daily driver and is currently on and running better than stock alsogalaxy note for the rom support
Android,not_removed,nexus bootloop victim 😢 and now nexus cheap and smooth devices
Android,not_removed,lg the best ergonomically designed phone of its time
Android,not_removed,htc one i keep my eye on new phones being introduced but ive been pleased enough with this phone that nothing has lured me yet its allmetal unibody is stylish the screen size is just right for onehanded operation and pocket comfort decent quick charge battery life and allinall the specs arent much less than the newest phones especially considering the pluses otherwise it seems to me htc doesnt do enough to market their flagship phones yet charges about as much as ubermarketers apple and samsung so i think they get overlooked a bit htc made googles pixel phones and with that media buzz the phones get rave reviews
Android,not_removed,yeah i just got the phone and im blown away really the only downside for me are the speakers
Android,not_removed,coming from stock nexus touchwiz isnt even that much of an issue compared to the days its still pretty speedy a ton of useful features and doesnt look that bad anymore the is probably the first phone i didnt want to root right away
Android,not_removed,i also just got the coming from an lg myself great device and you can hide a lot of the touchwiz stuff by installing good lock which you can set up to closely resemble stock android
Android,not_removed,there are even a few features with samsungs software that is much better than googles split screen comes to mind where on stock splitscreen has major problems especially how the windows are only allowed to be certain sizes whereas now i can basically have youtube play in the background with nearly no screen obstructed i also prefer samsungs keyboard but i use swiftkey anyway
Android,not_removed,i mean it is a premium device thats why it feels like a premium device touchwiz also isnt terrible on the
Android,not_removed,quick tip if anyones reading this days later disable animator duration scale in developer options my screen would be really slow to turn on after hitting the button but now its not really noticeable
Android,not_removed,fast charging too
Android,not_removed,just got rid of my exynos too much lag force closing freezing seems like it might but have been the norm though when it worked i loved it
Android,not_removed,decent camera lol the camera was horrible
Android,not_removed,i loved that phone but i only had two problems with it one the amoled display burned in around the navigation bar and the notification tray area two the battery life wasnt very good you would get at most hours of screen on time the standby was terrible for that phone as well
Android,not_removed,yup still my favorite phone of alltime
Android,not_removed,i love using my iphone because of its size but the moto x will forever be the best phone ive ever held
Android,not_removed,i love my but daumn this phone has given me headaches with its inconsistent battery and its rather poor build
Android,not_removed,does the nexus have the cpu throttling issue that makes my nexus practically unusable by the time it reaches percent battery
Android,not_removed,im still using mine but oh boy its dying edit dieing dying
Android,not_removed,really liked this phone but the battery was pretty garbage
Android,not_removed,gave mine away current user is still using it and happy
Android,not_removed,i hereby knight your flair to that of galaxy
Android,not_removed,i did that too generations is too long of a wait pretty impressed with mine
Android,not_removed,the nougat beta is so good
Android,not_removed,brotha is that you edge all the way mate
Android,not_removed,ive only ever owned sammy devices and this is definitely the first one that has everything id want out of the box
Android,not_removed,i love my edge i normally replace my phone each year but i have no interest in doing so this year this phone is perfect and the battery life is brilliant
Android,not_removed,how can i get in the beta or should i just wait for the release
Android,not_removed,try install the latest cmlineageos
Android,not_removed,this is where i am right now i love my nextbit robin but want the xperia performance htc or xperia compact for the better audio dac with my premium headphones
Android,not_removed,this is what i came to post i went from a moto milestone got slow after a year nexus s got upgradeitis galaxy nexus charging port failed warranty wouldnt cover it nexus cracked screen after months then used it for another months thanks to pi controls xperia been using my phone since june and still really like it battery is great screen looks good enough camera works well enough and besides not getting nougat thanks to qualcomm update support has been a little slow and good overall looking to see what brings as im in no rush to replace it still
Android,not_removed,seconded as my first and current until my arrives android i couldnt be happier im on the rooted mm gpe rom and performance and battery are both fantastic just as good as the day i bought it in minus dying at like but i still consistently get at least a good hours sot so thats forgivable for a year old phone if it wasnt for cracking the screen pretty badly i dont think id even want to upgrade yet
Android,not_removed,damn nexus is buttery smooth even after a year like a reincarnated nexus
Android,not_removed,i wanted a shield player so badly but i decided to just buy nexus players periodically the clearance prices were just too lucrative i bought my last one for something like at best buy a few months ago but ill definitely agree with you on the i bought a regular pixel when there was a sale and still find myself using the as my daily driver
Android,not_removed,wow really mi plus is awesome but camera is complete crap because i upgraded from edge so theres that miui is probably the best android os or maybe second to touchwiz but unfortunately it is not for me i traded down to redmi note and performance is better than mi plus with a custom rom camera is obviously crap but so is mi plus hehe
Android,not_removed,how many times u charge to write that comment
Android,not_removed,i love my note i do think the fingerprint is a pain but its nice to have one
Android,not_removed,my note has been slow since day one and the wifi chip crashed and burned about months ago have not had a good experience with this phone at all
Android,not_removed,hmm i dont hear much from sony these days glad to see something about their phones
Android,not_removed,i have an xperia and although it does get a bit hot when doing intense processing it is otherwise a wonderful workhorse that does everything i ask of it and the fact that i was able to use it at the pool and underwater without worrying about damage was a plus
Android,not_removed,i had a and the xz is a great upgrade the is a better chip without the heating or throttling issues the rgbcir sensor produces better camera shots in low light those were my two criticisms from having a i do miss the reflective back but id honestly think a sturdier metal back is better i do miss my lanyard slot though 😕
Android,not_removed,fi is awesome so is the my bill this cycle which ends tomorrow is peoples jaws hit the floor when i tell them that
Android,not_removed,project fi customer support is amazing
Android,not_removed,i really would love to jump on oneplus bandwagon i hope i can hold on to my redmi note until oneplus comes out
Android,not_removed,moto gets such a bad rep and maybe deservedly so but coming from a nexus that shit the bed finally the plus is fucking amazing stock android basically cheap expandable storage i wish it had wireless charging but damn what a great phone it is for the price the price of flagship phones nowadays imo doesnt justify the purchase of them compared to phones like this or something from one plus nowadays fuck the pixel the s whatever edge the only phone id buy right now to replace the plus is a z play
Android,not_removed,samsung nexus s definitely one of my favorite phones i got this as a replacement to a shitty cheap android phone i had at the time got the nexus s for on ebay and it completely blew me away used it for a good year and a half before switching out i still miss it
Android,not_removed,really i hated that phone i switched from an htc desire and i remember i was very dissapointed with the software and performance htc really was ahead of the time with their skin it improved stock android a lot i had to bear that nexus s for years before i upgraded to the galaxy note which was a huge huge improvement
Android,not_removed,ehhhh mine kept getting dust under the ffc
Android,not_removed,same i love this phone
Android,not_removed,glass screen protector for the back went a long way towards keeping mine looking nice
Android,not_removed,i believe the had a plastic back
Android,not_removed,did you install cyanogenmod onto it that was what i did with mine after a year
Android,not_removed,not rooting my xz either no need this coming from the person who made superoneclick that says a lot about how clean the phone is
Android,not_removed,unlock it and install los or cm if still possible
Android,not_removed,cant wait till i get mine in the mail
Android,not_removed,😬 i feel the same way with my moto z play the battery life is unreal
Android,not_removed,loved my take away the bootloop fear and i would have basically forced my friends to get it as it stands i traded it in via a great tmobile deal for a i usually keep my phones for years so it annoyed me to trade so early especially w a phone i loved
Android,not_removed,i loved the way my headphones sounded on the dac but i couldnt get the battery to last me past pm
Android,not_removed,first time ive seen someone talk up the axon welcome back from north korea
Android,not_removed,they really nailed it with the oneplus especially since it came after the rather disappointing oneplus theyre rolling out oxygenos android ota for the so thats a nice way to start off i like the sleek look and placing the headphone jack at the bottom makes more sense now the biggest feature id like them to add is stereo speakers it might not seem important but if youve used a phone with stereo speakers the difference is literally like night and day
Android,not_removed,i dont have to resort to lower res shots thats interesting i find that mp mode is better in low light because of less noise and blur in the corners the detail is of course lower but it is still plentiful for fullscreen viewing is there any special benefit from the rgbcir sensor in low light apart from spoton colors
Android,not_removed,the had a good battery rooted underclocked on another rom in a fridge with three apps or less installed
Android,not_removed,are the cm roms bug free now when i had that phone the stockcm roms were full of bugs like camera crashing lags and dialer proximity sensor problems
Android,not_removed,galaxy was a great phone the and were ass by comparison even the plastic was better had that ceramic feel to it
Android,not_removed,i had the too and the for a day can confirm that the is the extremely refined brother p definitely worthy successor after their other sibling the let the family down
Android,not_removed,touchwiz is no issue for me i love it im on the nougat beta and the new samsung skin and additives are what make this phone what it is a stock google experience to me now would be a disappointing thing
Android,not_removed,yeah when you are in a country that supports goodlock i cant download it in germany
Android,not_removed,i recently switched from a which i basically hated for that reason to a day and night so happy with it so far
Android,not_removed,mine has been limping along for months ended up just getting a pixel xl last week hoping thatll last me for as long as my dayone did
Android,not_removed,have you tried changing the battery
Android,not_removed,i feel like im the only one whos battery life got ass fucked in the heart ever since getting the beta
Android,not_removed,i think the beta filled up a while ago
Android,not_removed,you can flash it if you can find the right firmware i didnt get into the beta but theres a firmware somewhere on xda
Android,not_removed,verizon version locked bootloader
Android,not_removed,no moto features with custom rom kinda ruins the experience
Android,not_removed,i would love to put a gpe rom on mine but its a pain on the verizon the only complaint i have about the device is occasionally it chokes up really badly and also the camera is a bit slow
Android,not_removed,hehe funny with the different experiences yeah compared to edge the camera probably is a bit modest but the clear sight mode stereo mode actually improves things a lot i ran and on my redmi note for a while but still went back to miui for now i actually like miui but i do admit that its a wee bit as annoying to run through the list of adjustments every time you install it disable memory optimization disable battery saver restrictions enable auto start etc
Android,not_removed,i wish people keep asking questions which have the same answer
Android,not_removed,ive replaced the battery on mine numerous times just because its easy and cheap these days i have it running with aggressive doze it basically acts as a remote for nexus players
Android,not_removed,yeah for some reason people feel that sony phones arent great ive had now the then certainly the latter is better i like the simple unfussy design solid phones in my experience
Android,not_removed,my is also a champ still the only smartphone that i know of
Android,not_removed,the was the top sony smartphone the versions sucked because of the anything else that came after that was some kind of midranger disguised as flagships im still waiting for that amazing sony phone i know they are capable of releasing
Android,not_removed,att offers unlimited txt and talk and of data rollover data for a month fi is shit and i dont get why people praise it like its the next big thing
Android,not_removed,thats gigs of usage with a boughtoutright device though any other prepaid service would give you more data for the same price your friends are probably all on verizon or sprint paying for galaxy or iphone devices in installments with insurance thus fi is cool and with us cellular service it has arguably equivalent coverage to verizon
Android,not_removed,no doubt that in the future i will probably spend a little more money on a better device but the as an entry level phone into the android world has sold this ecosystem to me id also probably go for the z next motorola has blown me away
Android,not_removed,i used mine for too short since the galaxy nexus came along but gave it to a friend who used it until a few months ago and it still worked for plenty enough for him
Android,not_removed,well we had very different experiences then i couldnt wait to get rid of my desire there were so many issues with that thing the acceptable skin back then was indeed something i didnt miss dont tell me you didnt enjoy the fact you didnt have a phone anymore especially since or so months after the desires release app sizes started exploding from a few kb to dozens of mb
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,sadly its a hardware issuebad soldering so i cant fix it
Android,not_removed,i get and half hours of screen on time and thats it which kind blows but the stand by time isnt bad
Android,not_removed,its fairly popular on this subreddit
Android,not_removed,lower physical megapixel count produces better low light images changing the software option to wont make better pictures is always better than people talk about pixel binning but thats just another downscaling method vs pixel skipping here are some samples of to compare the rgbcir sensor allows more accurate colors reducing noise which is usually the biggest problem when capturing in low light edit heres a good paper that shows the benefits namely infrared on using an rgbcir sensor dont worry it has lots of picture samples httpwwwcstorontoeduhxtangprojectsinfraredmainrgbipdf
Android,not_removed,no matter what rom i flashed i never got more than hours sot
Android,not_removed,wasnt it just that since the and were so raved about that when the had so little change from the that its release was somewhat of a letdown it wasnt a big upgrade but if you didnt already own a then the is the better phone at least thats what i gleaned from investigating my options before deciding on the
Android,not_removed,also on nougat beta and back in the days these are words i thought id never agree with at least we can change the font size that was my biggest gripe stock touchwiz to me looks like a step down from senior mode
Android,not_removed,i live in the netherlands myself so i also cant download it officially but you can install the apk from httpapkmirrorcom without any problems
Android,not_removed,good ol verizon being bitches as usual
Android,not_removed,i guess so it depends whether you use them the only feature i use on mine is the feature where when you pull the phone from your pocket and slide to unlock i know some people probably use more of the features
Android,not_removed,replaced my old ones battery too but it started acting up in a month
Android,not_removed,had a sony xperia j performance was much better than the lg optimus which has the same specs so wouldnt mind trying it again if i have money
Android,not_removed,check out the sony xperia xz its really cheap and had pretty nice all around quality
Android,not_removed,swede swooshing in with unlimited text and calls within scandinavia usd
Android,not_removed,youre right but ever since i learned how to use the wifi at the hospital i work at involved credentials and certificates etc ive saved big time on my data because im always near wifi unless im on the road so im not limiting my usage to save im just being smarter about turning wifi on
Android,not_removed,shit youre old
Android,not_removed,downside to the screen is slightly curved so tempered glass is an issue any full sized glass is going to have lots of warped spotsi bought a smaller glass and still have slight imperfections in the edge usb c charges crazy fast but the wires are rare so you cant bum off a friend in a pinch currently a software side issue regarding auto camera in low light situations shooting manually presuming you know how solves it the lg omnipresent fear of boot loops and their poor customer service i was originally upset that the volume buttons arent on the back too but thats not appearing to be an issue everything else is amazing back fingerprint is a must removable battery and external storage are musts battery is solid camera is a beast second screen insanely helpful i love this phone
Android,not_removed,people talk about pixel binning but thats just another downscaling method vs pixel skipping if i am understanding correctly pixel skipping which is used trditionally is basically not using some pixels on the sensor at all so the amount of light falling onto every active pixel is the same and there is no advanatage indeed however in pixel binning the system averages over several adjacent in case of xperias pixels the amount of light falling onto three pixels is greater so that should result into less noise i havent yet shot all that many lowlight photos and almost none in full res but in my experience the amount of noise is significantly lower on isos up to the level of detail does seem somewhat lower than that of a true camera with sensor but is still enough in most cases which leads me to the next point here are some samples of to compare the mp photo there has a lot of motion blur to me it looks like the automatics derped out and chose too slow shutter speed which it likes to do in my short experience i am not claiming that the point is invalid though you probably have a lot more photos from xz pixel etc im just saying that that particular example is not very good imo i tend to just use mp in manual mode with fixed shutter speed for a static picture and it seems to be good enough i am definitely going to to shoot more lowlight photos in full resolution and compare them to mp ones edit heres a good paper that shows the benefits namely infrared on using an rgbcir sensor dont worry it has lots of picture samples httpwwwcstorontoeduhxtangprojectsinfraredmainrgbipdf now that is what i really like to see thank you
Android,not_removed,i was using a custom kernel and had gpu underclocked
Android,not_removed,i think the suffered it had worse battery worse panel etc sound was better though camera slightly better
Android,not_removed,last time i tried it it screwed my whole system edit it worked
Android,not_removed,yea americas kinda fucked i was just saying fi really isnt that great of a deal
Android,not_removed,from what ive read and researched pixel binning is more of a downsampling alternative the photosensors run at if you want to shoot at instead of just using simple downscaling pixel skipping it would use the sensor data to make a better image that said you can take any raw file and pixelbin it to since sony doesnt give access to raw we have to decide if jpg is better than a pixelbinned jpg thats completely subjective but from my personal experience i rather have jpg you can take a look at a good discussion about it here as for the samples i took numerous at at low light its just very hard to capture detail even the pixel with its larger sensor couldnt capture a lot of detail remember that these are final shots after the camera post processing so its very likely that the noise was cleaned by the processor which explains the blurriness regardless my wife has a pixel and ive done a bunch of comparisons and usually beats her pixel and generally loses out maybe sonys pixel binning implementation is broken i dont know but regardless of the reasons works best for me
Android,not_removed,only less max standby battery time but in talktime battery and everything else the is better or at least as good better processors more ram and improved cameravideo here are spec comparisons oh and the will be getting an os upgrade this month to android nougat
Android,not_removed,because fuck att its a matter of principle for me
Android,not_removed,idk mate its what i read at the time but you seem to have more detailed info
Android,not_removed,they all honestly suck

Android,not_removed,good lord i am never gonna comment using my phone again the hell
Android,not_removed,it is march in some parts of the world d
Android,not_removed,it is march in some parts of the world d
Android,not_removed,have a posting party did we
Android,not_removed,wait what day is it in some parts of the world
Android,not_removed,you do know you can delete comments right
Android,not_removed,were you using the website or an app i would try the latter there are various good apps
Android,not_removed,its– never mind
Android,not_removed,yes but yolo
Android,not_removed,i used a browser and it never confirmed or showed anything after i saved what i typed in so i figured it never went through imagine my surprise when i opened up the pc and saw all the bloody gremlinlike comments
Android,not_removed,i wish the z play would go down if it was that would be a steal they have it for right now
Android,not_removed,probably will piss off the early adopters i never get oems subsidising it so soon after launch they should do their research and start off with a great price they are billion dollar companies so i guess this approach works but it always keeps me from pre orderding things
Android,not_removed,i know is to early for a discount on a z play but come on xd off wouldnt be to much to ask
Android,not_removed,uuugghh i just got this from verizon three weeks ago for full price 😖
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,it doesnt have band but it should still work on all carriers
Android,not_removed,has anybody ordered from expansys before that z play price is great and they look legit but ive just never heard of them i hope its a us model dont want to go without the us warranty
Android,not_removed,youll get shite reception though at least on tmobile
Android,not_removed,yeah but it has the verizon firmware and updates will be controlled by the useless carrier unlike the pure edition moto z wish they had the moto z force pure edition as well
Android,not_removed,surely only lte will work
Android,not_removed,you have the leeco pro coming for after rebate though they want you to use their services and im not sure how customer service will be it has a battery the rumored moto m is supposed to have same processor as moto z play and have a mah battery
Android,not_removed,have a look at the redmi note better in every single way compared to the z play it performs better than a nexus does not throttle at all in fact it doesnt get hot even under load thanks to the snapdragon has a ridiculously large battery and it costs like on amazon it doesnt support all bands though so ymmv but you can get excellent stock roms on xda its an insanely popular device having plenty of dev support
Android,not_removed,they sell a lot of international phones but i think this is the us model the moto x is going for around right now so the price of the z play might climb down in a few more months
Android,not_removed,only in cities with buildings that block signals for most towns and anywhere else without skyscrapers bands and are adequate
Android,not_removed,youre better off without band i can never pull more than mbps on
Android,not_removed,no headphone jack bad qc shitty software
Android,not_removed,the moto m wouldnt have that battery the lenovo is the one with it
Android,not_removed,their bootloader unlocking process is painful the official unlock process demands you request for permission wait for anywhere between a day to weeks for approval use their windows only tool to unlock iff you get past the bugs
Android,not_removed,ｗａｒｒａｎｔｙ
Android,not_removed,i have thread going on and i am a pro photographer so i have some skills nobody who likes to take pics in the dark would want to buy this phone daylight pics come out good though the phone is a champ except for low light camera aspect
Android,not_removed,i get great speeds with band its just because so many people use it since it goes such far distances its better to have than to not have though even if it doesnt work since you would only have otherwise at least thats how i look at it
Android,not_removed,tmobile only has mhz of band so it gets bogged down quickly tmobile needs to activate carrier aggregation in as many places it can while seeding the market with ca devices
Android,not_removed,the software isnt that shitty though theres an xposed module to easily enable stock android apparantly the stock android is still there just hidden behind a layer thats pretty easy to disable
Android,not_removed,what then what will it have it should at lest get same battery life as moto z play
Android,not_removed,i got mine in an hour as did my friend who bought the device a week ago theyve been selling so many of them that theyre just approving the requests quickly apart from that the process is to install the china rom unlock bootloader flash twrp and then custom rom of your choice it all a one time process so id go through it but yeah its not as simple as a nexus fastboot unlock command its sad that theres no other device with a snapdragon that has such a massive battery and custom rom support and costs i personally dont like miui at all which is why recommending the device asis can be difficult
Android,not_removed,usa eu thats a problem
Android,not_removed,in my experience you do better turning off lte and going with when you are on band
Android,not_removed,so like i said its essentially useless
Android,not_removed,oh sweet so the mods are basixally only apks because when i used it in china it was like all the bad parts of miui and emui mixed together with a ios seasoning
Android,not_removed,they have changed the things at more fundamental level i had a leeco le and they use a modified contacts storage system which will automagically merge all contacts with same name none of the contacts apps will be able to help you as the storage itself is screwed up here sold it off with this disclaimer to a friend as couldnt see different people with same name being shown as a single entry in my contacts
Android,not_removed,i dont know what battery itll have but it was corrected that the mah were specs for the
Android,not_removed,for my previous phone i keep getting stuck at with message saying the accounts dont match i am in process of getting it done for my wifes phone which is again at the same juncture the price is hard to beat they got everything right except miui only if i could understand why companies go extra length to make their devices suck with their rom
Android,not_removed,isnt the pretty good for that too just unlock boot loader and throw on cm looking at getting my first android and am genuinely interested
Android,not_removed,yh so it cant be compared properly to way more expensive devices
Android,not_removed,still good for reception so that i can sms and make voice calls
Android,not_removed,you know except when you need to make callstexts
Android,not_removed,like for eui they had their customized notification bar and stuff but they just never removed the stock version it was still there just disabled most custom uis will strip away the stock parts after they replace it with the customized versions eui just kept both ones and just disabled the stock version
Android,not_removed,well they make a fuckton of money by partnering with cheetah mobile loading their cm security shit into miui so that incentive alone is enough for them to create a makeshift software layer around it cm security is literally baked into settings its fucking insane i have no idea what sorts of data it is collecting really scary dont get me wrong miui does have some really neat features and is extremely pretty compared to the sometimes mundane stock feel but its horribly unoptimised and has bloatware at its core
Android,not_removed,yeah pretty much mi has great specs but needs to be handled like a baby so its something to take into account its a bit expensive too perhaps you could find a good deal on a galaxy non exploding variant lol ive been eyeing one myself for a while small flagship phones are so underrated these days

Android,not_removed,well hspa isnt on mhz so you youll literally be losing the ability to use your phone without it in some cases
Android,not_removed,depends on the phone chipset itself if its an exynos version heres where to go if its snapdragon youll have to see which exact model it is and then flash that rom there are plenty of great roms in xda usually when the choice gets overwhelming i sort the forum by number of views and go for one from the top three that fulfils my needs popular ones get updated regularly so its best to go for them alternatively just get the latest stable from httpwwwcyanogenmodorg and youd be good to go as well
Android,not_removed,considering it has warranty for places where it is supposed to be sold it is outstanding
Android,not_removed,look of you are trying to compare no service at all with voicetext only then fine its better than nothing unfortunately ive gone from decent usage in heavily populated urban areas oakland sf san jose portland to shitty where i cant load imgur

Android,not_removed,depending on where you are it might be integrated where i am right now it shows bus times when i tap on a stop i still use a separate app as it is faster if you are in the seattle area pretty much everyone uses onebusaway which shows realtime arrival times
Android,not_removed,its integrated to google maps ive lived in couple of countries and visited several others in the last years and public transport options were shown everywhere edit an example
Android,not_removed,have a look at citymapper here in london its our local darling but it really is the best app for public transport use ive spent many hours using both transit and citymapper and since they both pull their data from the same sources the differences lie in app performance and functionality citymapper is simply faster smoother and smarter with many more ridiculously useful features than transit which come from a dev team who seem far more engaged with their audience give it a try and let us know if you like it ps live bus train tram etc arrivals are integrated into google maps too here in london since the transport for london apis are accessible for all though google maps handles that data a little weirdly instead of showing a minute countdown it shows how late or early the service is running relative to its timetabled time its a feature which is hard to find too hidden in transport directions and the details when you click a stop or station weird
Android,not_removed,my city already has a dedicated app that surprise surprise is also material design how does this differ can you still buy tickets on the fly
Android,not_removed,if you have a named list you can also add items verbally using ok google super cool
Android,not_removed,i honestly love google keep i just wish it had nexus imprint support on android and touch id support on ios thats the main reason i dont use it
Android,not_removed,i love how well keeps sync works i add an item on my computer and seconds later its on my phone
Android,not_removed,can you lock notes in google keep just wondering as i havent found a decent note app which can sync with ios and android
Android,not_removed,this in conjunction with cam scanner i never need another piece of paper again also massive google photos
Android,not_removed,i lost a very important piece of information as i accidentally deleted a chunk of text from a keep card and as the app has no undo function it was gone for good
Android,not_removed,im a huge fan of keep but i really wish they would allow notes to have sub categories i would like to break down my grocery shopping list by typespasta dairy meat etc
Android,not_removed,the only thing that makes me not use this more often is the lack of an undo button i use notes for work most of the time and this killed me on more than one occasion
Android,not_removed,i wish there was a lightweight desktop counterpart for google keep i dont want to log into google every time i want to use keep i delete cookies on exit
Android,not_removed,there is a great feature on the desktop extension that lets you save pages in keep really useful if you need to research something later on a different device i use it all the time on my work pc saving reddit pages and links i want to check out when i get home or reference that weekend for a project apps like pushbullet and join are good but not the best option if you dont need the link for a few days
Android,not_removed,i didnt really see the use for it at first but now i find it amazing i use it for any kind of list or little notes the best part is being able to quickly pull them up on my watch like when im shopping
Android,not_removed,yup i have the widget on my home screen with all my notes love it you can add pictures on there too for whatever reason and they look nice especially on the widget
Android,not_removed,dont forget you can have it remind you at a specific place or time also your notes sync with all your devices and the cloud so you can access them from any device
Android,not_removed,ive been using keep for a while now and absolutely loving it i love being able to create lists in chrome and have them sync with my phone i just found out you can collaborate lists this takes it to the next level
Android,not_removed,i would love to use firefox but the weird scrolling speed thing is a non starter for me
Android,not_removed,personally i would recommend httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonublockorigin as the adblocker really lightweight but still compatible with common blocklists
Android,not_removed,well shit i may have to try it knowing this thanks
Android,not_removed,and now the webextension work being gradually done firefox might be weirdly enough the first android browser to support chrome extensions as well
Android,not_removed,i tried it for a while but its been extremely slow and plain not responsive to some things and search buttons on websites ill be back when its on chromes level
Android,not_removed,my mobile browsing has been so much nicer since i switched to ff with an ad blocking addon
Android,not_removed,exactly why i use it i wish there was a way to block ads in chrome without rooting only issue with ff is lastpass auto fill doesnt work with ff but works perfectly with chrome
Android,not_removed,unfortunately performance is much worse than chrome and stock browser
Android,not_removed,may i ask how you think it stacks up against fuelly ive been using fuelly with good results only drawback is that you need to go full site either on browser or through app to view certain things like old records and other peoples results i like that the asp is simple and straightforward
Android,not_removed,does it automatically log your mileage or can you only enter it manually i have to keep a journey mileage log and im basically awful at it by automatically i mean does it figure out you are driving using locationgps and log the miles travelled by car

Android,not_removed,shealth is a surprisingly good app
Android,not_removed,how id like to know more i have the app on my phone but seems that i mostly left it untouched maybe sometimes i play with the stress measurement
Android,not_removed,i love shealth not only does it do everything in the background and even track my runs automatically but it can also track my cycles sleeping habits food heart rate and stress level all in one app its by far samsungs best app and should be advertised more
Android,not_removed,similar thing here a combination of google fit and google calendars new goals feature has gotten me burning an extra calories a day and im looking into getting a gym membership in the near future all i did was set up for calendar to remind me to do minutes on my elliptical machine once a day and ive only missed day in the last month and a half or so
Android,not_removed,i too would like to know more is there a routine you have that makes you use it frequently
Android,not_removed,same i also started using loop habit tracker to try training myself in areas that i normally lack the will power to keep doing consistently
Android,not_removed,is it really that good im into fitness and self improvement but i never touched it because eww samsung stereotypes
Android,not_removed,the accuracy and battery drain improved so much in my note it destroyed my battery and gave me far too many steps on my edge its not too hard on the battery and its quite accurate more so than my g watch and about the same as my fitness band
Android,not_removed,just installed this today on my nexus hours later it had used of my battery while i just sat in classes and didnt use my phone at all nopeapk i dont need battery hogging apps when i can simply use google fit for the basic stuff
Android,not_removed,i just wish it was compatible with bt smart pulse trackers thats the only thing im missing

Android,not_removed,i second this
Android,not_removed,yeah i just started using this instead of tinfoil its great
Android,not_removed,i cant wait until swipe can upload videos i just ditched facebook because it was using half as much battery as my screen did with hours of use that means that facebook was using as much battery as hours of my screen being on an app shouldnt need that much power
Android,not_removed,i liked sleep as androids gentle rising volume option too i never really used any of its advanced features i stopped using it when recent versions of googles clock app added a rising volume option as well though its nice that sleep as android lets you create a random playlist of alarms instead of just one tune
Android,not_removed,are you using it with a wearable or just on your phone and if on your phone do you need to keep your phone on your bed or can you leave it on the bedside table
Android,not_removed,absolute life changer you wont believe the difference a minute margin for your alarm makes in your morning
Android,not_removed,ive used so many other alarms and keep coming back to sleep as android even though a lot of other apps are way prettier the functionality in sleep as android is unparalleled im horrible at waking up in the morning solving really hard multiplechoice math problems is finally enough to get me awake
Android,not_removed,have you tried timely its what i use and im just curious what you think the differences are
Android,not_removed,yes true one of the best apps ever

Android,not_removed,my biggest issue with textra which is also why its not a nonstarter for me is that connected devices dont recognize incoming texts as texts for example my car can read text messages it wont beep or read the text message if its from textra but it does from every other app im actually using yaata for its customization right now but textra had the best quick reply of any text app ive tried
Android,not_removed,textra eventually pushed me to port my google voice over to my tmobile line its great

Android,not_removed,relay is sluggish personally ive found it to be impressively slick and smooth across multiple devices even on an old galaxy i used to use sync but switched when the syncing feature stopped working and the dev claimed it wasnt a priority despite the name
Android,not_removed,what is better about this compared to sync
Android,not_removed,absolutely love duolingo ive learnt so much spanish because of it
Android,not_removed,came here to show some love for duolingo id heard a lot about it but never tried it then decided to sample some of the german lessons and soon i was hooked
Android,not_removed,i changed to boost from reddit is fun just because i can watch youtube videos without being redirected to the youtube app i have never looked back
Android,not_removed,i second changelogs when you apply it if isnt too bad
Android,not_removed,changelogs works for you for me it only displays following with every single app no changelog found there is a bug with googles data where some apps are missing and unfortunately there is no way for changelogs to fix this because the information comes directly from google alternatively the app may not exist on the play store too bad since this is an app i definitely need

Android,not_removed,i love signal unfortunately i couldnt convince anyone to switch over to it so i started using whatsapp a few months ago it has end to end encryption now as well and its been pretty great plus a whole lot more friends were already on it
Android,not_removed,get google opinion rewards so that youll be able to buy the full version
Android,not_removed,this is one of those apps that once you start using it you cant live without it also one of those didntknowineededthis things highly functional and highly useful its also nice to get notifications from apkmirror for google apps or anything you want
Android,not_removed,limiting sms replying from computer nailed the coffin for me that i dropped it all together
Android,not_removed,google hangouts does this natively for me maybe because i have google fi but i can do everything on my computer make calls sms mms texts answer calls etc is this not the case for non fi users
Android,not_removed,try httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomtextysms i use it on my laptopdesktop using a chrome browser extension and also the app is on my phone and tablet so basically no matter what im doing it is really easy to see and reply to my texts you can also set it up to mirror other notifications from your phone to your computer and it will give you an alert if your batter is low or when it is done charging

Android,not_removed,yeah i feel like all of the other apps try to be like desktop reddit whereas relay does its own thing it might be similar with the card layout and stuff but its different in a way to me once you get used to it its hard to switch off

Android,not_removed,onebusaway was pretty great despite the old interface
Android,not_removed,i started using citymapper this year and i love it their devs are very responsive to bug reports as well being able to save common routes and view them with a tap is great
Android,not_removed,ive heard really good things about city mapper but they support only a handful of cities in the us its a great option if you live in one though
Android,not_removed,agency x is made by the same people as one bus away and has a new interface i use it every day and i highly recommend httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidorgagencyxandroid
Android,not_removed,btw if there isnt a list already named it will automatically create the list for you additionally if you say add the following items to list name it will prompt you for each until you say im done or finished great way to create a shopping list as you are going through your pantry or fridge
Android,not_removed,whats the command to trigger this
Android,not_removed,did not know that thanks
Android,not_removed,for what
Android,not_removed,for me it works even faster almost instant
Android,not_removed,its instant not seconds you just need to refresh
Android,not_removed,i dont think you can lock notes in keep you can password protect pages and sections in onenote
Android,not_removed,same here had a huge shopping list shared with someone and they somehow managed to delete almost every item without knowing google needs to add a simplified version of the revision system used in google docs
Android,not_removed,well dont delete your cookies then you cant have it both ways either delete your cookies and suffer through a poor user experience or dont if youre worried about tracking grab an extension like ublock or umatrix to block the cookies outright from bad domains andor disable thirdparty cookies
Android,not_removed,there is if you look for google keep in the chrome store you can download the desktop app and it looks and works exactly like the phone app but on your desktop and it syncs seamlessly
Android,not_removed,theres a keep chrome extension and it will also give you a button in your menu to save the current page to keep or you can right click anything and save it to keep instantly
Android,not_removed,exactly thank you finally im not the only one turned off by this theres something weird about scrolling inertia and im not exactly sure what it accomplishes
Android,not_removed,whats weird is that folks at rfirefox completely ignore it as if it doesnt lag and others say a fix is coming
Android,not_removed,you can actually fix this by going into aboutconfig and changing the smooth scrolling value edit basically go to aboutconfig in firefox and change the value of toolkitscrollboxsmoothscroll to false
Android,not_removed,i think theres a flag you can turn on that improves it
Android,not_removed,the nightly has a much improved scrolling compared to release
Android,not_removed,i use firefox and cant think of what youre talking about whats the issue
Android,not_removed,and yet still no chromecast extension of ff desktop i appreciate it on the ff android version but seems like a huge oversight to ignore it on desktop
Android,not_removed,if you think firefox and ad blocking is nice give the standalone adaway a shot if youre on a rooted device it blocks ads systemwide using the hosts file its incredibly empowering if youre sick of ads everywhere
Android,not_removed,yeah that annoys me too i switched from dashlanetoo expensive to lastpass and i recently installed their desktop mac app i hope they add ff mobile support soon
Android,not_removed,no you have to manually log the miles its really easy to input them when you fill up

Android,not_removed,if only it wasnt tied to the device
Android,not_removed,thanks for reminding me of the new goals feature will try this
Android,not_removed,i take an average of resting heart rate over three times a day once shortly after i wake up once on lunch break and one shortly before i go to work a few months ago my resting heart rate was way above average floated as high as not doing anything i did the same with stress levels and blood oxygen levels stress was through the roof always in the red and my blood oxygen was this is a good sign of hypertension it made me change my diet and go back to the gym i have now got those readings into check where they shoud be and lost quite a bit of weight in doing so edit i also want to add that i do use the step counter and watch the calories burned i have checked the apps reading against various treadmills and it is damn near spot on in both distance and calories burned i then take that calories burned info and input it into mfp
Android,not_removed,those people stereotyping samsung users can fuck off they do it because they hate touchwiz i used to agree touchwiz on kitkat and older sucked shit through straws its fine now and yes shealth has been the primary motivator in changing my life it opened my eyes to possible health issues for example the readings showed that i could be in hypertension stages my grandparents both had hypertension issues my grandfather eventually passed from a heart attack over the shit i actively use it and have reaped benefits however i also pair it with mfp i dont want to sound like a fanboy though i hope i dont
Android,not_removed,im not so concerned about steps but distance the distance measuring is damn near accurate against a treadmill that also tracks distance the difference is negligible distance calculates calories burned
Android,not_removed,shill warning it doesnt even even break for me and it runs on my note
Android,not_removed,i thought mfp works with bt devices
Android,not_removed,i should have noted that i also use the math feature to turn off the alarm thats probably my favorite thing because i have to make the conscious decision to do math equations at that point its a challenge to fall back asleep
Android,not_removed,you need to keep it on the mattress if you want to make use of the sleep tracking smart alarm features since it keeps an eye on how much you move around based on how much the phone is being shoved around on the mattress in your sleep so that it can estimate remdeep sleep and wake you up appropriately basically bed
Android,not_removed,bedside table for me but as points out it needs to be on the bed to take advantage of certain features i currently am not using any wearables so i dont know if it integrates
Android,not_removed,i use it with a wearable if you want to ask any questions i frequently dont manage to track my sleep though but thats my watchs fault my has such shit battery life that i usually cant even put it on overnight because it needs to charge when i get home but the tracking itself works very nicely
Android,not_removed,ive been waking up more positive and ready to kick the day with this one
Android,not_removed,it is pretty strange it usually wakes me up within the first seconds and the volume is still pretty low

Android,not_removed,wish we could access something from the pc as well so we could type stuff out rather than always using the android keyboard gonna try it out though ive been wanting to try journaling and meditation recently and i think this might help thanks for the suggestion
Android,not_removed,i use journey and it seems to do the job
Android,not_removed,trying this
Android,not_removed,you have to install a generic equalizer app for it theres loads of them on play store though
Android,not_removed,it doesnt
Android,not_removed,not op bit pia is basically the cheapest thing on the market they keep no logs and have servers basically everywhere i wont lie its pretty nice
Android,not_removed,could you possibly be on an older version i have had to since drop the facebook sdk so if the version is you wont be able to log in try killing the play store and then clearing the play stores cache to force it to check for the latest versions download again and you should be all set
Android,not_removed,in terms of functionality where the official app is a and tinfoil is a id say swipe would be somewhere at in terms of battery life and resources used where the official app is a and tinfoil is a id say swipe would be a not implying that tinfoil is bad in any way and only scores a on anything but just wanted to put it into a scale so its easier to visualizecompare swipe just adds a ton of functionality to wrapper apps but it also requires a bit more resources but comparably still a lot less than the official app
Android,not_removed,have you tried emailing them they have good response times
Android,not_removed,the time bubble or the notification because you can disable the bubble
Android,not_removed,im not ucurrently but its to unlock all features i installed this app along with jefit and fitnotes and ended up liking it the most its got a couple of annoyances but overall im happy with the app i never used fit journal this one httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcommaestrosultanfitjournalru it looks really good as well i might check it out as an alternative if progression stops being great for me
Android,not_removed,there are a ton of machinebased exercises too you can use the filter to narrow down the exercises by equipment youre probably referring to the builtin schedules that come with the app he included some of the most common strength and body building routines but theyre just there for convenience the strength of the app is the ability to make your own routines you can make your own routine with machinebased exercises if you wishjust create a new routine and use the filters to help find the exercises you want if you cant find an exercise you want you can just let the dev know along with a description and youtube video and hell add it in hes quite active and responsive to users also hes soon gonna release the ability to share custom exercises and routines with friends which is gonna make the app a ton more useful

Android,not_removed,off the top of my head it supports tables you can tag users progress bar for gifs lots of customization
Android,not_removed,you can set the font sizes for posts and comments individually in slide
Android,not_removed,im the kinda guy whose music tastes change every few months and so spotify is amazing premium is worth every penny

Android,not_removed,thats weird i just checked mine out and its working perfectly fine im on a galaxy edge running marshmallow what device and software you have

Android,not_removed,it gives a lot of togglesapart from the standard ones plus many options for rooted users i cant list all the features heretheyre too many just try it out the app is free and has no ads
Android,not_removed,is it not subscription based

Android,not_removed,sorry im late i was in a meeting in an they basically said that they needed to monetize it to make money to continue to support it makes sense but even after people were willing to pay for it in the past they wouldnt accept peoples donations i understand what theyre getting at and for the most part you can remain on the free version but id rather donate to join now
Android,not_removed,can that apk be run on marshmallow lolipop
Android,not_removed,i cant tell you cause ive never used pocket casts i dont know if podcast republic is the best one as its really the only one i tried and it does what i need so didnt really try others one complaint i have is it downloads podcasts slow i did try one other forget the name but was one with a high amount of downloads as well and that one downloaded podcasts way faster i cant remember the reason why i didnt like it though over republic
Android,not_removed,yes in grade i got the edge
Android,not_removed,they get their data from the metro system its not the apps fault that the data for routes like the number bus is apparently pulled from an alternate dimension
Android,not_removed,doesnt transit pull data from the same source i never got into transits interface particularly because i found it difficult to look ahead to see if i could make a connection
Android,not_removed,thats a fair comment but they have a voting page on their website to nominate and vote for future cities so its the ultimate in democratic app development they periodically release new cities at a speed which is quite surprisingly quick especially when you consider the myriad functionality that any citymapper city includes
Android,not_removed,thank you striving to get some reliable etas

Android,not_removed,i can get s health on my priv literally just went to the play store to see if i could check it out seeing as so many people like it and im about to
Android,not_removed,huh
Android,not_removed,how can it measure your oxygen blood level
Android,not_removed,this is great thank you im definitely going to check it out anyway i dont really hate on samsung itself the new phones are sexy as hell but i think they only fully woke up now by the time the galaxy was released the introduced that poor ram management no expandable storage nonsense and poor battery life samsung actually listened to the customers and fixed these three in the im still bothered by clean masters apis being preinstalled
Android,not_removed,each to his own my steps vary quite a bit in distance depending where i am walking so i care more about the steps i just need a benchmark for myself to beat so i just want something constant and relatively consistent i bring my phone everywhere so its perfect for me while things like a fitbit gets steps when i am just moving my arms which is not ideal
Android,not_removed,shill warning i installed it because of your post and uninstalled it because it doesnt bring anything useful to the table for the amount of battery it used yeah sue me call me a cuck next
Android,not_removed,i forgot about that feature its pretty neat i think one of the options is to make you scan a qr code that you have to print out and put somewhere not close to your bed
Android,not_removed,it does integrate with wearables but only specific ones theres a httpsleepurbandroidorgdocumentationintegrationwearable
Android,not_removed,i used it for days and am pretty disappointed first of all it is chockablock full of settings its overwhelming anyway i went through all that and set a smart alarm it is supposed to wake me up when its most optimal for my sleep right darned thing always woke me up in middle of deep sleep i think all times i woke up groggy and irritated stopped using it and went back to stock alarm
Android,not_removed,wooaahooooooooo
Android,not_removed,which would you recommend
Android,not_removed,i live alone and im not a student unfortunately i wasnt aware that you can share the family plan will check that out thanks
Android,not_removed,openvpnprivate tunnel is pretty good you pay for the data you use for for or for unlimited cheaper than pia
Android,not_removed,hey i wanted to ask you a question i am on android and while the payed version says its compatible with my phone the free one isnt is there an actual reason for this or is it just a mistake
Android,not_removed,i was using an older version since apkmirror showed it as the latest however the newest version is and im on so i cant install it
Android,not_removed,yesapparently its just the way the app is coded in order to get other functionalities linking with other apps from what i understood to work
Android,not_removed,what i must have missed it thanks gonna look in the settings again edit sorry cant find it are you sure
Android,not_removed,yup im checking out progression for now looks like lots more workouts
Android,not_removed,is one of the annoyances being that every so often it doesnt save a created workout day i havent submitted a bug report because i cant reliably replicate it but holy shit this drives me up the wall
Android,not_removed,its the best on battery ive seen of a weather app i have a widget on my home screen set to update every the longest available update option but it still tries to sync more often than that over days standby i have wakelocks from it should only be if syncing every still comes out to per day or what it should be i wish it was less aggressive trying to update or even better offer a manual sync only option but its not really an issue as it doesnt disrupt deep sleep i tend to hit the refresh icon on the widget once in the morning and again after work dont need it to be constantly updating in the background like that
Android,not_removed,for me its the timeline i dont need information about the current weather i can look out of a window
Android,not_removed,syncing entire poststhreadssubreddits for offline use i believe sync for reddit was built upon this premise hence the name id never used the feature but i would be surprised if isnt still included in sync
Android,not_removed,i used to be firmly in the download camp as i grew up in the dial up era and you really had to work for your music even when itunes came out it was quite painful to use for a windows user but with and a phone bluetooth headphones i have basically my own musical universe if i want to listen to brazilian baile funk on my subway journey home i can download a play list in about minutes on my walk there or some country music while talking a walk in the woods i remember having to choose my track play list to put on my player for the school day and now that users can pay £ a month its even better
Android,not_removed,ive been using boost for a few weeks now but just recently switched back to sync boost is great and pretty but i felt like it was a little slow in comparison im on the n beta though so im not sure if that has any influence on it
Android,not_removed,that was going to be my second choice when i decided to find a replacement for reddit is fun if boost was trash maybe if i tried sync first i would be using it right now
Android,not_removed,nexus on mm but on custom rom dirty unicorns i think that may be the reason
Android,not_removed,thanks a lot i feel stupid that i havent found it before
Android,not_removed,how much does pro cost
Android,not_removed,wow i am surprised by your detailed feedback about this many many thanksgonna try it later tonight when i am home again many thanks
Android,not_removed,might be related to adblocker
Android,not_removed,i also would like to know
Android,not_removed,thanks i had to change my note title to grocery list to make this work i had the store name as note title before which didnt work
Android,not_removed,you can use an xposed module called maxlock that will let you choose apps to be protected by nexus imprint authentication really should be a standard feature in android to protect apps chosen by the user
Android,not_removed,sorry didnt realize that part
Android,not_removed,hmm havent really noticed that myself
Android,not_removed,yup ive given up on ff for android
Android,not_removed,see my edit
Android,not_removed,basically go to aboutconfig in firefox and change the value of toolkitscrollboxsmoothscroll to false
Android,not_removed,oh my god this is the best thing ever
Android,not_removed,im assuming you turned the option off for her haha
Android,not_removed,one question i already have a mi band can i just set it to track steps instead of my phones accelerometer in s health removed fit because of this
Android,not_removed,s health con info strictly for samsung devices unlike fit if you get a new device unless its a samsung you cant transfer previous data besides that s health all the way edit didnt know samsung released it as a standalone app compatible with any device
Android,not_removed,httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomsecandroidappmusic isnt this it i dont like it much i use black player for simplicity
Android,not_removed,you can still find it it in galaxy apps as samsung music
Android,not_removed,not with the heart sensors only on galaxy i believe although iirc the apple health app lets you check hr
Android,not_removed,cant get shealth for non samsung devices
Android,not_removed,from wikipedia in its most common transmissive application mode a sensor device is placed on a thin part of the patients body usually a fingertip or earlobe or in the case of an infant across a foot the device passes two wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector it measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths allowing it to determine the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone excluding venous blood skin bone muscle fat and in most cases nail polish
Android,not_removed,i just assumed you were shilling once i read nexus its probably best you use google fit for it anyway maybe it is better optimized for samsung devices like i said it barely cracks running all day long i know someone at work with an that uses it and she has the same results in all fairness i did check out fit but it lacks the heart rate monitor and stress functions so i cant use the hardware i have to the fullest potential
Android,not_removed,i use the similar nfc tag option absolute necessity for me now no more being able to dismiss the alarm in a half sleephalf awake state and oversleep i just place the nfc tag in my bathroom drawer and it forces me to get out of bed
Android,not_removed,well i cant speak for most of the settings ill admit there is a bunch and definitely can see it being overwhelming for me i just picked out the few settings that suited me and thats ignored the rest
Android,not_removed,whatsapp a friend of mine spent some time abroad and i could text call her on my cell using my wifi eliminates international charges
Android,not_removed,try out alarmdroid it also has the rising volume alarm im using it since at least years and love it never used sleep as android so i cant realy compare them linkme alarmdroid edit sorry i missunderstood i tought you didnt like it because it has too many features or something
Android,not_removed,youre a master of karate and friendship for everyone
Android,not_removed,ive used this one which seems pretty good httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomsmartandroidappsequalizer
Android,not_removed,okay sounds like a nice alternative do they log
Android,not_removed,check out httpsbolehvpnnet looks nice but costs like twice as much
Android,not_removed,hey there unfortunately ive had to drop support on the free version anymore and theres a full explanation as to why here however ill always maintain the free version for android in a folder through google drive adding an apk there every time a stable release is added please bookmark it heres the link
Android,not_removed,how are you on i am on
Android,not_removed,ahh i see unfortunately ive had to drop support on the free version anymore and theres a full explanation as to why here however ill always maintain the free version for android in a folder through google drive adding an apk there every time a stable release is added please bookmark it heres the link
Android,not_removed,thats so strange i was just about to also comment that the rest timer can be disabled but then i went and searched and couldnt find the setting i wonder if it was removed in a recent update hmm
Android,not_removed,weird i swear i had it disabled and off before sorry guess i must be going crazy
Android,not_removed,i havent experienced that one yet i think the biggest problem i have is its a pain in the ass to add workouts on the fly i have three days i work out and sometimes when im there i have more time for more shit and when i do its just kinda cumbersome to add more exercises i understand the process kinda but it doesnt make it less annoying i really hope i dont come across your bug though
Android,not_removed,did you make sure to disable the current location card and just set it as your city instead
Android,not_removed,obviously not a ios user here you are not afraid to use windows
Android,not_removed,player lucky i had a cd player throughout high school bumping the latest eminem that i downloaded and burned to a cd
Android,not_removed,yes im thinking thats reason just make sure i uninstalled and installed again no issues
Android,not_removed,per year
Android,not_removed,it happens to me all the time both my devices are on mm rooted across reinstalls and reboots and even rom changes i had to migrate to boost and sync for now linkme boost for reddit linkme sync for reddit
Android,not_removed,how so i dont have adaway just min min guard which is an xposed module
Android,not_removed,actually idk what phone i have 😂
Android,not_removed,every few months someone makes a post saying they fixed the scrolling in the new nightly i try it out and its the exact same weird behaviour isnt there a standard scroll function for developers so many apps even simple ones have better scrolling that ff ff on android is dogshit slow too a page loads in seconds while chrome will have it fully loaded in i love the addons but there are too many flaws to make them worth it currently happy with lightning browser for the different rendering modes i can get a black background on of pages thanks to lightnings inverted mode
Android,not_removed,i didnt actually lol i thought it was cute of her and she actually got the hang of it and even if she fails it doesnt kill her to have duplicate photos on her of emptyness but yeah think ill ask her this thursday and if she still wants to ill disable it
Android,not_removed,no clue honestly
Android,not_removed,really like s health too the only thing bugging me which fit gets right is automatic tracking when im on my bicycle when im going to the university it tracks it as steps in stead of km on a bicycle
Android,not_removed,s health is available on all android phones not just the galaxies
Android,not_removed,ah great thanks
Android,not_removed,ah great thanks
Android,not_removed,yeah you can it works on all devices
Android,not_removed,so its like a thing you pull out from the phone or is it like an accessory
Android,not_removed,i dont have a heart rate monitor zenwatch and stress function fanciness i just want to know how long i was on my bike jog walk thats it sorry i jumped at you i had a long day
Android,not_removed,is there a way to override it when youre not sleeping at home
Android,not_removed,you replied to the wrong person d

Android,not_removed,this was the one i used as well but on my it was glitchy at best half the time it didnt work and i had to keep going into the app and turn it on and off i had some other issues with phonograph on marshmallow so i went for poweramp no where near as pretty but no issues and one of the best eqs i have used
Android,not_removed,i am pretty sure they dont i cant check right now though rvpn recommends them and its been pretty good so far i am still on the they give free
Android,not_removed,thank you very much for the answer i will surely check the free version from your gdrive
Android,not_removed,i meant android
Android,not_removed,ah thank you i understand thanks for the link
Android,not_removed,im not sure it was ever there i believe i just revoked its draw over other apps permission
Android,not_removed,nah hadnt messed with that one i assume youre referring to settingsinterfacelocations dont show current place i just checked it will see if it helps thanks for the suggestion
Android,not_removed,thanks for your effort ill try reinstalling but if it doesnt work i think its my setups fault
Android,not_removed,that seems kinda steep for what it is my mom has gotten from rewards in the two months shes had it but i think thats just because she very frequently goes into town to shop and other things like that

Android,not_removed,i dont know i used to have that problem and read that it was fixed by adblock iirc try searching on reddit this
Android,not_removed,this is why im killing myself
Android,not_removed,exactly however me the pages load fast but the ui is too clunky scrolling is horrendous
Android,not_removed,firefox is probably handling all rendering by itself android does provide you with standard scrolling behavior but you have to use the builtin views to get that to work most likely firefox is one giant view and they draw everything directly to the views canvas this means they have to detect drag events themselves and apply a scroll behavior and theyre nowhere near as good at it as google is
Android,not_removed,guess there are no cons for s health p
Android,not_removed,weird i got it on my
Android,not_removed,no the builtin sensor on the back throws red led light onto your finger and absorbs back the transmitted light i dont know how this type of measurement is pretty standard fare
Android,not_removed,then yeah fit is a better choice for you if you dont need all the extra or lack the hardware to make use of i should also disclaimer that if you use it on a nonsamsung device ymmv
Android,not_removed,yeah i just have a separate alarm that i turn on
Android,not_removed,yeah shutting the phone off
Android,not_removed,whoops my bad
Android,not_removed,oh sorry read everything too quickly
Android,not_removed,oh yeah of course ill just do that until the developer adds it i really hate all those floating windows and chat heads
Android,not_removed,yep it should decrease those wakelocks because instead of always checking for your current location it just uses the predefined city you type in and add manually
Android,not_removed,when rewards asks the question regarding sex answer with female historically there are more surveys targeting women than men
Android,not_removed,i just know it has a pen in the bottom
Android,not_removed,its called magic
Android,not_removed,im not even sure how a fifth grader is smart enough to know how to browse reddit let alone even know it exists realize the os his phone is using is android but not know about what phone heshe uses
Android,not_removed,how can i get that on my note thats you days ago seems like you know which phone you have edit upon further investigation it seems you had a a few months ago wtf dude are you really in the grade
Android,not_removed,wait is it a magna doodle
Android,not_removed,i can upload the apk so there is a small chance itd work here
Android,not_removed,sike i know im actually sophomore i just wanted to see if you guys believed a grader
Android,not_removed,im just wondering why youtube doesnt use the oss share menu and has its own slow implementation instead
Android,not_removed,i wish google would stop trying to make a social network happen
Android,not_removed,great thanks google for this useless feature
Android,not_removed,google i dont want to share the horrible things i watch with people i know same goes for that dumb all devices on the network chromecast notification
Android,not_removed,the youtube app is just utter shite
Android,not_removed,butwhy
Android,not_removed,kinda related anyone know a good way to change default android share menu for all apps i mostly share to my pushbullet for looking it on pc sometimes to so very rarely somewhere else but most of the time i get some suggestions from outlookinbox or google messenger app for people i never write on phone or never share anything to them wtf
Android,not_removed,i wish there was a party app that i could use similar to what swipe for facebook is
Android,not_removed,im still on version ffs
Android,not_removed,ive had it forever ab testing
Android,not_removed,okay ill ask it what is the best thirdparty youtube app on the play store
Android,not_removed,just keeps on givin
Android,not_removed,because they didnt want to switch the arrow for the standard share button so this was the compromise
Android,not_removed,not on the yt team but i know why my own company uses our own share menu we use it for analytics ie seeing how people share what app they share to etc the native implementation doesnt allow for this so we have to unnecessarily write our own though we try to make it as close to the native implementation as possible
Android,not_removed,google photos also uses their own implementation it isnt slow but it seems odd maybe just to add sharing to photos libraries
Android,not_removed,seriously when i use youtube i try to avoid every other user there
Android,not_removed,one thing i wish they would add is some social aspect to play music though one thing i liked about rdio and spotify was the ability to see what my friends were listening to or what was on their heavy rotation plays recommendations and autoplaylists are pretty terrible in comparison the only reason i switched is for the free months
Android,not_removed,why the regret about the
Android,not_removed,you think that but it could potentially stop some shit commentators from adding their shit comments when they are recommended adding their mom
Android,not_removed,settings google google cast turn off show remote control notifications alternatively next time you see one expand it and tap the gear to go right to this toggle
Android,not_removed,i share videos with friends i dont think its a strange feature at all my share interface doesnt look like this though
Android,not_removed,its a great app tho does what it needs to and looks great
Android,not_removed,im wondering why this warrants its own post and an upvoted post at that
Android,not_removed,nougat lets you pin apps too the top
Android,not_removed,server side update ab testing
Android,not_removed,nah thats my mum
Android,not_removed,loled hard from this one d
Android,not_removed,heh interesting on the iphone the uiactivityviewcontroller has a completion callback that tells you the activity that was called shared to thats pretty odd that android doesnt do the same
Android,not_removed,does this work only for the notification on my device or does it stop the notification from showing up on my girlfriends phone when im casting as well do i need to go into her phone and disable it too
Android,not_removed,problem is it shows up on devices like my moms phone which i have no control of
Android,not_removed,you clearly havent used mytube coming from windows phone the official youtube app is utter shite
Android,not_removed,at least someone is aware not everything that pops up in the yt app is a permanent addition seems this app has the most ab testing out of all of googles to those who have this and dislike it go to the main page tap the three dot menu on the top right help feedback scroll down and send feedback saying why you dont like it
Android,not_removed,shut up chelsea
Android,not_removed,d
Android,not_removed,i liked rdios heavy rotation home screen the most for finding what my friends were spinning autoplaylists only go so far rdios werent great spotifys are a lot better imo google still seems to think i like every band under the sun because theyre the same genre
Android,not_removed,do hers
Android,not_removed,as uthevoiceless mentioned this setting is specific to the device its on im hoping google eventually adds a toggle to each chromecasts settings too
Android,not_removed,every device
Android,not_removed,you could ask to borrow her phone to turn off an annoying thing google added because she might accidentally pause or stop your casting if your concern is just her seeing the content youre casting afaik it only lists the app thats casting not the content
Android,not_removed,mytube is really great that was one of the best perk of having windowsphone is there any third party youtube app thats better than the stock i wish mytube developer makes an android app
Android,not_removed,so pandora
Android,not_removed,google would block it instantly unfortunately they would get better support on windows phone than android
Android,not_removed,never used it is it more like a radio station service or a straight up music service with a library playlists etc
Android,not_removed,more like a radio based on things drawbacks the catalogue is severely limited you wont find a lot of really popular songs also you will get the chance to hear a lot of songs multiple times were talking about a catalogue thats literally a mere fraction of spotifys anyway context is not that great in a genre based radio youll be hearing songs that obviously dont have anything to do with it lots of ads audio ads video ads pop up ads nearly full screen ads ads that prevent you from clicking on things only available in the us yeah no its not worth it
Android,not_removed,only available in the us ah im in canada so thats not even an option then
Android,not_removed,i used to use a random free vpn from italy it works fine app from apkmirror ill warn you its a lot of trouble to go through for so little gain if youre a free streamer spotify free is better than the paid version of pandora this tells you a lot

Android,not_removed,i too would like a gtx in my phone
Android,not_removed,yes because all we need is rgb mods on my phone bezel
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,shout google share this on facebook in the bathroom when you suspect your coworkers are watching porn
Android,not_removed,how about add to bookmarks instead
Android,not_removed,fun fact you can also say send this to insert contact here to text them the link
Android,not_removed,it would feel much more conversational to say hey google share this on twitter imo
Android,not_removed,so yeah this would be the first thing i would nuke on my pixelassistant capable device even if it requires root fuck auto sharing shit me and friends already annoy each other enough with ok google randomporn or call x i cant imagine what would happen if you can post crap without consent
Android,not_removed,if your coworkers are regularly jacking it in the work restroom you probably want to find somewhere else to work
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,irregular jacking ok then
Android,not_removed,its only fair to let a few slide by
Android,not_removed,i guarentee there will be third party manufacturers for this for a third of the price
Android,not_removed,usba no usb
Android,not_removed,not a bad option i dont even own a pc anymore i have a desktop at work and everything i do at home is on my phone this could be a good option for me
Android,not_removed,is there any intelligence in this thing if not that price is pretty high for basically a dock with ports
Android,not_removed,id prefer a laptop or tablet shell instead needing a monitor and keyboard and mouse if you have those stuff you wouldnt need this probably lol
Android,not_removed,serious question who would be ready to pay that amount of money to use samsung dex dont get me wrong its neat and love the concept but i have a hard time finding it a real purpose on a daily basis for any power users or professional
Android,not_removed,this should be an option to select instead of the gearvr for preorders id snag one of these in a heartbeat instead of that
Android,not_removed,ill wait for samsung str thanks
Android,not_removed,for this price couldnt you basically just buy a computer instead heck you could get two of these for around that price
Android,not_removed,i really dont like the idea of docking a phone people dont like that and they will forget it insted take the same abilties but do it wirelessly all you would do is use a nfc chip in the monitortvlaptop etc etc as a connection establishment then you put the phone down on the foot of the monitor which has wireless charging or just put it back in your pocket and if you go out of range it just disconnects and saves the work you did all samsung would need to do is add this ability to all there screen based products smartphones are going to become the personal compute unit that everybody carries around the next step is seamless useage of traditional interfaces for the phones such as a pc interface a tv interface etc i would also really like to see more connection between my smartphone and my pc one the things apple dose really well
Android,not_removed,will we be able to use the os on a screen without the dock or is this dock a must own piece
Android,not_removed,im hoping my continuum dock will work
Android,not_removed,for id pick this up to mess around with no more itd also have to be compatible with my
Android,not_removed,april fools
Android,not_removed,idea is not anything new of course httpswwwkickstartercomprojectsandromiumandromiumthenextevolutioncomputingplatform been looking for something like this for tablets that way i can replace my daily use laptop and desktop and use windows only if i really need to hate windows so much
Android,not_removed,will this be able to run games i mean games that are heavier than say fire emblem heroes or puzzle and dragons
Android,not_removed,since there is very little info about this i think its safe to assume this thing only outputs a signal also i find it hard to want a dock for a phone that i might only keep for a year samsung might end up with the problem lg had last year with modular accessories if they become disposable quickly then people will be hesitant
Android,not_removed,motorola tired this and it failed a while back
Android,not_removed,headphone jack
Android,not_removed,so its just like a paid version of sidesync then edit other than being a hardware version of a free software solution what is the difference then i use sidesync on my work computer every day i just dont see how this is any different than my existing usb connection
Android,not_removed,i thought there was only samsung dex has it been confirmed third party manufacturers can make their own samsung dex
Android,not_removed,and the thirdparty options will probably have more features
Android,not_removed,these ports are for peripherals such as keyboard and mouse which are typically usb
Android,not_removed,i demand lpt ports mouse and scsi for my zip drive
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,maybe one day well have a beefed up dock with a gpu in it and we just dock our phones to use as a regular pc and it can run real games i wouldnt need a traditional pc anymore i can dream
Android,not_removed,this is exactly why im interested in it i no longer own a computer and just use my work laptop when needed id much rather leave it at the office and use my phone as a computer while at home
Android,not_removed,youll still need to buy a monitor mouse and keyboard​ and for a you could probably even find a more powerful computer like the intel compute stick to plug into it as opposed to this thing
Android,not_removed,samsung branded official dock with ethernet usb slots and a fan makes sense
Android,not_removed,theres also a fan
Android,not_removed,asus or acer tried that
Android,not_removed,guaranteed big retailers like best buy and carriers will have bundle deals that pack in a basic wireless mouse and keyboard or if they dont the two cost about to buy cheaper even with bundle deals and depending on where you buy it from
Android,not_removed,power users or professional thats not the target audience i use my macbook at the house to pay bills go on reddit and occasionally research something i dont need anything fancy the dex setup would be absolutely fine for of my use cases the only other thing i use the computer for is videos when i travel which admittedly is not that often no reason i cant use the phone and bring a power bank with me
Android,not_removed,i might have to get this since they dropped mhl support or any hard wire hdmi out i like to use my phone to play games on my tv so streaming is completely out so if i have to buy this dex thing or wait for another company to do so if that means i can play my games on tv then so be it how samsung has gotten away without having hdmi out no stream is crazy to me
Android,not_removed,my mom doesnt need a desktop she needs a machine that goes on the internet and does stuff so having one device is better
Android,not_removed,yep the dex functionally should be in the samsung monitorstvs inorder to incentives people getting a samsung phone or a samsung tvmonitor depending on which other product they got first
Android,not_removed,im not sure i really understand the point of it if your tech needs are so simple you can get away with using a mobile os and mobile hardware and just wanted a bigger screenkeyboard its already trivial to do that today with cheaper parts and for a power user professional like myself it obviously got no point
Android,not_removed,there are a lot of people whose only computer is a smartphone this is a great product for them for or less they can get a decent desktop experience dock monitor peripherals
Android,not_removed,using dex
Android,not_removed,the dock is probably required hardware for the dex app to run just like with the gearvr you have to have the gearvr connected to run the oculus home app
Android,not_removed,it doesnt seem like it i havent seen anyone talk about using it without the dock i wonder if thats just because nobody has plugged in a hdmi cord into it yet i would assume theres something in the dock that triggers the phone to go into pc mode
Android,not_removed,as long as samsung doesnt artificially gimp it to force you to buy their over priced junk
Android,not_removed,what do bad in windows
Android,not_removed,it will only play android games because its still just an android system
Android,not_removed,potentially if you install moonlight game streaming and are running a companion desktop with geforce experience
Android,not_removed,according to samsungs live stream its supposed to be capable
Android,not_removed,there was info floating around that it actually does
Android,not_removed,unlike the lg attachments it doesnt look like the dex station is made to perfectly fit the shape of just one particular phone theres a good chance but no guarantees yet that itll remain compatible with the note etc
Android,not_removed,smartphone performance was a little bit poorer back then
Android,not_removed,motorola should totally revive the atrix id be all over it
Android,not_removed,a while back yeah years ago things have changed since then
Android,not_removed,sidesync requires you to have that extra computer this option is to replace your computer only a keyboard mouse monitor required
Android,not_removed,watch the promo videos which explain what it does
Android,not_removed,sidesync unless they updated sidesync it only works as a remote connection to the phone where you can use the phones features on a pc with the dex you dont need a pc you plug your monitor and keyboardmouse into the dex and the phone will function as a basic pc stuff like documentation web browsing
Android,not_removed,the dock is basically usb slots a fan and ethernet so unless samsung only allows the official dock for using dex theres nothing stopping third party manufacturers for making their own dock and even then you could find some cheap knockoff that works pretty​ much the same
Android,not_removed,wheres my
Android,not_removed,is backwards compatible
Android,not_removed,maybe the port on the is also so no point putting a port on the dock
Android,not_removed,wtf samsung no cassette drive
Android,not_removed,external gpu all the things
Android,not_removed,i mean if youre willing to put up with having the docks and a full desktop setup witu a monitor keyboard and mouse why not just get a small form factor pc
Android,not_removed,or or a beefed up gpu would already be inside the phone mind blown
Android,not_removed,i use my phone for web browsing reddit social media email messaging and an awful lot of porn i work in the staffing industry
Android,not_removed,there is also the cost involved in making the new user interface
Android,not_removed,lol no it doesnt there are full computers for that price with more ports this is insanely over priced for what it is not even gigabit ethernet which is standard at this point not even a single usb port its pretty bad
Android,not_removed,really thats a great idea
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,but for the cost of a dex monitor keyboard and mouse you can get a windows or chrome os laptop that performs about as well if not better for example i recently picked up a windows tablet core gb ram display i couldve picked up something with an atom cpu and similar specs otherwise for around
Android,not_removed,youre the target audience for the macbook
Android,not_removed,i hear you but would you really swipe your macbook for dex
Android,not_removed,i might have to get this since they dropped mhl support or any hard wire hdmi out effect meet cause
Android,not_removed,i didnt think of that use case its a pricey mhl equivalent to play games on your tv but it does the job
Android,not_removed,touch based games with mouse are pretty terrible
Android,not_removed,it dosent have usbc to displayport connection
Android,not_removed,you could buy a chromebook for not much more though
Android,not_removed,never say never the atrix hd was hacked to enable lapdock mode without the lapdock required root hack mini hdmi cable and power
Android,not_removed,i figured no other way to charge that much and get away with it
Android,not_removed,things like drivers virus malware simple things that should work just dont and you almost always have to find workarounds just tired of it now
Android,not_removed,there are some good old pc classics on android nowadays though baldurs gate icewind dale rollercoaster tycoon knights of the old republic etc
Android,not_removed,it might even play them better since the screen resolution will probably be less than on the phone what a time to be alive
Android,not_removed,id imagine itll be awesome for emulation though
Android,not_removed,that would be nice then
Android,not_removed,more of a reason to get a note now
Android,not_removed,a little is probably an understatement
Android,not_removed,that is very true
Android,not_removed,also dont forget the convenience benefit of only owning one device all of your apps contacts pictures music etc will be available when using it in computer mode
Android,not_removed,if you have a monitor mouse and keyboard chances are you have a pc
Android,not_removed,and netflix and multi window support should be pretty cool
Android,not_removed,theres software needed to turn the phone into a desktop though its not as easy as you think if it was wed see a bunch of them already but we only see some from certain companies and their phones
Android,not_removed,yeah just like theres party gearvr no wait theres not because samsung locks down the software to their hardware
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,but if youre making it solely for pieces of equipment that deal in a im assuming cheaper version of usb why woild you step it up
Android,not_removed,so you can just kris kross them
Android,not_removed,note has usb gen i doubt theyd go back to usb for the if the dex dock supports that bandwidth for that would limit usb data to usb some sources say dex is limited to but claim the phone supports over displayport
Android,not_removed,usb can not carry an hdmi signal and two more usb ports
Android,not_removed,literally doa
Android,not_removed,hmm and if it goes on the top of our lap what should we call it
Android,not_removed,i thought about it but if we have a beefed up gpu inside wouldnt it run really hot when using it in docked mode we can use the phones gpu for mobile game but if we want a full desktop experience with photoshopgamesvideo editing id think an external gpu would be better the phones processor is already going to be under stress we dont need two nuclear reactors inside
Android,not_removed,i think these are key questions for people who are the target market for this devicefeature im a project manager in the software implementations space and i know for a fact i cant fit this device in my workflow ive found a way to make a lot of cool tech i wanted work but this one is a head scratcher i work in my office about of the time balanced with another working from home and in meetingsinterfacing with clients away from the office and my need for power on demand is pretty crucial its rare but the times when i need to compile software or play with video are when i need my workstationsystem to be able to kick in and go vroom add to that im a pc gamer and a rhomelab subscriber so having the get up and go on tap is pretty crucial the only things i own that dont have that power are my tablet and my phone but thats compared to my workhorse devices in their class theyre pretty solid people who have the gig and clock out at may be able to find the use for this but when my life is my work i need a real machine everywhere i go
Android,not_removed,this is primarily why it costs so much my samsung rep told me its basically booting into a separate partition of android sort of that had its own backend development
Android,not_removed,it is in fact overpriced if you look at it on a part and spec sheet its pretty much a piece of plastic with a fan and some basic ports for but youre ignoring the external factors that samsung is using to try to justify its cost to customers dex functionality is something they had to cook up at home and youre paying for the software product around the dock rather than the parts in the dock itself guaranteed you could build the dock for like but the rd of the software feature dex that the piece of hardware is used as a key to unlock is why samsung has the balls to demand this price dex is not accessible without the dock so the dock basically is dex
Android,not_removed,yup to cool it down
Android,not_removed,yes but then you dont get a dank as fuck minority report futurtek dock to show your kids how tech savvy you are to be serious i dont think people who use dex will be into buying an old asscheap ass laptop because the novelty factor of dex will probably factor into the purchase think about the psychological difference between having the cheapest ass laptop vs having the fancypantsest feature from the fancypantsest phone of the year thats why people will buy it i would also bet money that there will be lots of carrier plans and shit that throw in the dex and maybe gear vr as a bundle deal so you sign your soul away for years to verizon and get both for free or something
Android,not_removed,its about a unified environment for me
Android,not_removed,yeah i think the extra money you have to put on the table to buy a keyboard mouse and mostly a monitor will stop the majority of average users to switch to dex and if you already have a mouse keyboard and monitor chances are that you already own and desktop pc anyway
Android,not_removed,i dont believe samsung is expecting people to trade in their laptops for a dex its more for people that doesnt have a laptop or a desktop or a broken one if they are upgrading to a new phone and needs a basic pc for web browsing and read a few documents its pretty much a smaller chromebook like device
Android,not_removed,if theres a third party that wants to do the same thing for cheaper ill use that i dont see that happening though
Android,not_removed,trust me im sure a mhl cord would work just fine but i think since the note they stopped supporting it also the reason im such a fan of that is because i travel a lot with an mhl cord i was able to be at any hotel no wifi necessary and plug my phone into any tv now apparently i have to spend to do the same thing that four year old phones can do it is really irritating
Android,not_removed,oh sorry i wouldnt know my friends and i use sixaxis so we can play player smash i dont think ive ever tried to do a point and click game on my tv
Android,not_removed,i believe neither the or of last year had it and i know they took that feature out from the note and so id imagine theyd keep that tradition going except now theres a device i need apparentlyhaha
Android,not_removed,thats a good point
Android,not_removed,wow my experiences vary so much from what to you have said i cant remember last time i had to do any of that i have to admit that dex in corporate usage could be great success i know i would love to use one in my workplace
Android,not_removed,i am running pcs in the house and they all work without issue have not had a virus or malware in years
Android,not_removed,dont forget the greatest game of all time goat simulator 🐐
Android,not_removed,yeah but there are a lot of things that are cheaper that are awesome for emulation
Android,not_removed,hopefully i can already use chromecast with steel series android controller for all emulation
Android,not_removed,youre monitor could be your tv and you could use a bluetooth keyboard that you might have for your tablet
Android,not_removed,not in an environment where thin clients are used as its cost effective
Android,not_removed,the software could be on the phone tho
Android,not_removed,yeah that would only happen if samsung did something anti consumer and artificially gimped their software to not work except on official usb docks
Android,not_removed,if its similar to the dock for continuum then you don not need the dock to run the software microsoft uses an app to launch the launcher whether you have it connected through a dock or typec to hdmi out
Android,not_removed,cant you use the usb port on this for other stuff such as flash drives and hdd
Android,not_removed,because its a dock
Android,not_removed,for i would expect at least one type c gen preferably gen port so i can use a portable ssd
Android,not_removed,that would have no effect usb type c has separate lanes for alternate modes that dont affect usb bandwidth when in use display port is one of those alternate modes
Android,not_removed,yes im fairly sure most type c on phones is i remember the htc being a notable exception with usb gen
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,im pretty sure the one in my phone is
Android,not_removed,the alternate modes are separate from the usb portion they use separate pins
Android,not_removed,desklap sounds brilliant omg why arent these made
Android,not_removed,your samsung rep is just some bro paid to stand there and explain stuff off a script he has no insight into the high level decision making that went into the pricing
Android,not_removed,or samsung has set the price that high because they know people will buy it they will then lower the price in a few months to a more acceptable price
Android,not_removed,you sign your soul away you get my upvote 😂
Android,not_removed,i think its more about having everything located on a central device some people like to simplify things
Android,not_removed,monitor tv you can get a wireless kbm for like bucks
Android,not_removed,i think youre right actually i predict very little success for the dex in developed countries where laptops desktop pc penetration rate is really high but samsung could have a shot in countries like india or in africa where people have actually more mobile phones than pc
Android,not_removed,could chromecast screen mirroring be a viable option for you
Android,not_removed,haha each their own dex is going to be the future for sure i dont believe peoples confidence in the cloud is enough right now may never be with all these constant reports of hacking
Android,not_removed,might but i bet theres some sort of propietary verification on the dock similar to the one on the nintendo switch
Android,not_removed,this is likely however its also how the gearvr works afaik there are no third party headsets that are able to trigger the software
Android,not_removed,if it is it wouldnt need a dock just a cable
Android,not_removed,so youre telling me the files are in the phone
Android,not_removed,why
Android,not_removed,and i would like to ask why is this shit bucks it dont look like it should be
Android,not_removed,no displayport alt mode reconfigures the superspeed pins for video data it can use half of them for two lanes of dp data enough bandwidth for and or all of them for four lanes of dp data there are also some sideband use pins which dp alt mode uses for auxiliary data not video usbcs pins dd cannot be reconfigured for alt mode
Android,not_removed,pixel htc lg note and xperia xz premium all support usb gen on usb typec ports its fairly common now among flagships
Android,not_removed,afaik the first wave of typec was mostly with the lg and htc being exceptions
Android,not_removed,usb c confuses me
Android,not_removed,can confirm am samsung rep
Android,not_removed,callin it like it is
Android,not_removed,samsung has set the price that high because they know people will buy it yes no duh captain obvious but the reason people will buy it at their set price is because it is being justified to them somehow ie not by the cost of the physical base but as a gateway to dex as a whole
Android,not_removed,tvs are typically more expensive than monitors
Android,not_removed,seeing how the dex is only currently available on their flagship galaxy i doubt budget or midrange phones will be supported
Android,not_removed,it might be too expensive for budget markets atm maybe people like people that dont want to have a desktop or dont see the use for them its a pretty niche market but there are some people that really likes smaller pcs but want something with a large monitor mini itx pcs nucs apples non pro lineup desktops but with a portability feature
Android,not_removed,i tried it and its super laggish and theres a gap between the sound that comes out of your phones speaker and the image on tv
Android,not_removed,afraid not any kind of streaming especially when it involves gaming just has too much lag trust me i wish or they could have just kept support for hdmi out and i wouldnt have to try plan b through z i always thought people pay dollars for these phones and they cant even wire them to their tvs streaming doesnt work for everything samsung you ass faces
Android,not_removed,i dont think that dexlike devices will be considered​ viable for endcustomer it should be great value for corporate especially considering knox and fingerprint iris etc i work in vw and our latest move from blackberry to iphones was really big deal most emphasis was put on safety of data
Android,not_removed,thats a shitty apple app issue
Android,not_removed,i wasnt aware that the switch dock had any sort of verification cant you just use any old usbc cable
Android,not_removed,twrp that verification away
Android,not_removed,the dock has an ethernet port usb slots and a fan would be kinda clunky to use a cable for all that
Android,not_removed,the fan on the dock is needed for cooling
Android,not_removed,that doesnt make any sense
Android,not_removed,because they can
Android,not_removed,probably for gaming
Android,not_removed,model m
Android,not_removed,its a super low level port so it will pretty much always work even if your motherboards usb drivers fuck up and all your usb ports are dead also unlimited key rollover though that might have been fixed with newer usb keyboards really no reason to not use it
Android,not_removed,is actually better for keyboards than usb it lets you press more keys simultaneously and has lower latency since it interfaces pretty much directly with the hardware
Android,not_removed,something something key rolloverdriversinterruptswhatever its bullshit mostly its just for geek cred
Android,not_removed,because samsung likes money
Android,not_removed,rvxjunkies
Android,not_removed,true if you do use all four lanes you dont have super speed but two is enough for if you have display port which is available now on gpus
Android,not_removed,yeah i guess it was mostly the first gen of type c phones
Android,not_removed,try to think about it this way usb can be divided into physical sizes ie a traditional rectangle b squareish one used in printers c rounded rectangle etc as well as technology speeds etc so you could have a micro usb port which would be different from a usb type c port or a usb type b port edit there are subclasses such as micro usb that have the same internals hence easy adapters but different physical connectors it is kinda confusing as almost all modern devices are moving towards and the type c standard is slowly adopting it gets even more complicated of you begin to consider thunderbolt certification and bus speeds i hope that this helps
Android,not_removed,usb c is just the connector
Android,not_removed,loving the honesty tried to become a samsung rep in the uk because of the goodies they got choice of flagship phone notesx laptoptablet and company car and more pay than i was getting at the time
Android,not_removed,but someone who doesnt own a desktop computer is more likely to own a television than a computer displaymonitor
Android,not_removed,but most people already have tvs in their homes
Android,not_removed,that sucks bro i wish samsung just supported mhl hdmi would be so much simpler
Android,not_removed,aw that sucks bro im sorry
Android,not_removed,i dont see why they would people wouldnt buy their more expensive dock then
Android,not_removed,for charging yeah but not for outputting to hdmi
Android,not_removed,no not yet you can of course charge with your own cable though but the dock also does hdmi out which i dont think has been figured out
Android,not_removed,dont think the market for third party docks could sustain itself solely on people who know how to use twrp
Android,not_removed,rooting jailbreak is apple if the dex is anything like the gear vr it a two way check you need the software in the phone to work with party devices which depends on how the verification process is coded into the app and then you need the device to communicate with the app in the same way as the dex rooting wont help unless you have a bunch of skilled devs trying to copy the dex
Android,not_removed,theres already phones that do this that only require a cable not a dock
Android,not_removed,exactly saves a port aswell
Android,not_removed,mini and micro usb actually fall under the b class of connectors traditional b is the large rectangle you refer to and then you have the smaller versions minib and microb c is a class all to itself there arent multiple sizes of the c connector
Android,not_removed,thank you it helps the thunderbolt ones throw me most
Android,not_removed,it is a really solid gig all the management ive met has been some of the best ive had and they pay is pretty solid its been a great job to pay the rent as i finish up school
Android,not_removed,but are they on your study table or are they mounted high on a wall away from your couch
Android,not_removed,just think about all the apple products you can buy that are party and look at how much money apple gets from official cables and cases android is similar for things like official cases for the nexuspixel lines
Android,not_removed,of course not party gear vr replacements have to be made specifically for that purpose which would never happen the twrp using market is too small for dex no dedicated hardware solutions would be needed therefore i think this could be possible for the twrp users
Android,not_removed,jailbreak is apple not really jailbreaking is a generic term edit no idea why this was downvoted you know three years before the iphone
Android,not_removed,or you could use root and stuff to tell apps that youre on dex and activate the dex software on the phone
Android,not_removed,i know it wouldnt need a dock doesnt make ant sense what does it mean to need a dock that makes no sense
Android,not_removed,actually there are microa and minia connectors too microa is completely rectangular like a filledup microb it does spin ones head at first
Android,not_removed,thanks ill update my post
Android,not_removed,i think were going off on two different roads my response was to address the idea that the cost of buying a monitor and a keyboard and mouse will stop people who dont already have a pc from using dex because you dont need one maybe if they want to move the experience to your desk the dex will be the catalyst to that who knows my point is that its disingenuous to tack on the price of a monitor as being a startup cost of using dex i dont think anyone really believes this is a replacement to a laptop
Android,not_removed,work at best buy can confirm
Android,not_removed,if its that easy how come theres no gear vr copies out
Android,not_removed,if theres verification on the dex dock that is needed to use dex then you need a dock
Android,not_removed,yeah i omitted those because they are discontinued
Android,not_removed,my point is that its disingenuous to tack on the price of a monitor as being a startup cost of using dex its not really apart from cost you also have to consider the portability factor do you remember when you moved away from desktop to a laptop or lan cables to wifi router that monitorkb will be sitting on a desk all the time no more working on a couch working in the balcony or working in the bed or wherever you would like on the desk all the time for bucks you can get a full powered windows tablet laptop that you can use everywhere and that can also let your use case grow with time vs same for dex setup that you have to use in one spot offers no portability and will only get leggy as you phone agessee how many users are complaining about declining performances not to mention what continuous use of dex will do to your battery health have you ever used your phone as a wifi hotspot for hours
Android,not_removed,because dex will use a standard screen
Android,not_removed,it will use a standard screen with a validation process within the dex knowing samsung it might even not function with rooted device like the knox services
Android,not_removed,fuck them knox ew magisk should prevent that atrocity
Android,not_removed,installed as im a developer i think its hard for users to build a circle as you guys imaged
Android,not_removed,stupid brexit gahh
Android,not_removed,ohi never thought aboutim not from ukso didnt give much thought
Android,not_removed,software software software software the frog in the weather widget
Android,not_removed,you cant even buy one
Android,not_removed,reason not to buy pixel phone lack of sd card support youll run out of storage fast unless you get the best version price since lack of sd means you cant really buy and is also not future proof is damn expensive
Android,not_removed,its one of the worst phones in terms of what you get per its the same problem apple and samsung have they are so overpriced they actually cannot be good edit how old are you guys do you have any concept of money if you like to give away money for free pm me personal opinion doesnt matter on this topic high prices are worse than low ones thats it
Android,not_removed,an iphone clone and price competitor but doesnt have as many features as the iphone and only years of os updates no thank you
Android,not_removed,why not
Android,not_removed,you can here
Android,not_removed,i just bought one the other day and my boyfriend bought one a week earlier
Android,not_removed,valid points no expandable storage is a deal breaker for a lot of people however i would be fine with a personally since most of the content i consume is on the cloud or online
Android,not_removed,huge bezels can also be counted if you ask me 😂
Android,not_removed,while ill admit the pixel is a hell of an expensive phone it is the best phone ive ever owned and could possibly be even a three year phone if i truly wanted
Android,not_removed,thats a matter of opinion edit for you dumbasses down voting me it really is a matter of opinion stop jacking each other off with your circle jerk bullshit
Android,not_removed,im guessing because of the backorder
Android,not_removed,because people in here take every chance they can to dig the pixel that poster has no idea if its in stock or not
Android,not_removed,oh are they shipping immediately yet
Android,not_removed,your flair says and pixel which do you prefer also if your name is a radiohead reference youre awesome if not youre not
Android,not_removed,got the myself and havent ran nto any storage issues im using currently sd support is hopefully on its way to being improved i hope current microsd support is slow as shit compared to usf when will we see usf sd cards
Android,not_removed,we are taking about most unlocked root friendly phones out there custom rom is name of game here im not sure how big rom images are for nexuspixel but if any thing like htclg then at least a gb then you need minimum clean stable and preupgrade twrp backup thats easily spent right there even a dirt cheap class card easily deals with stuff like that and for media storage or backup speed isnt that important
Android,not_removed,seconded
Android,not_removed,thats absolutely contradictory ive got a oneplus one its a few years old and sooooo much better than the pixel edit downvoted by money farting donkeys who dont know a bit about reality
Android,not_removed,price is not a matter of opinion design is but the price is an objective number higher is worse lower is better how important the money is for you is indeed everyones own decision but ppl here argue that money doesnt matter at all
Android,not_removed,you can buy them from the carriers here as well in canada didnt know there was a backorder on the phone
Android,not_removed,yep
Android,not_removed,it is a radiohead reference i really enjoy both the pixel and the but tend to use my pixel as my daily driver mainly because the camera on the is pretty awful compared to it i also enjoy just how smooth the pixel is compared to the has very noticeable touch latency
Android,not_removed,for taking nandroid twrp titanium backups and storing media speed isnt important a class card is fine
Android,not_removed,thats also a niche thing only accounts for a small percentage of users reddit and xda are a vocal minority imo
Android,not_removed,how is it contradictory its expensive its very expensive but its good and i feel like it is worth it just because it is expensive doesnt mean it cant be good i personally can not stand oneplus design the support is crap and i personally dont trust them but again its all a matter of opinion
Android,not_removed,you can buy it directly from google in canada too right now
Android,not_removed,says all xl is out of stock for me
Android,not_removed,not everyone wants to store media on their phones i respect that there are those who do however im only guessing but isnt streaming way more popular than storing music or movies on your phone these days im just guessing
Android,not_removed,its contradictory because the price is a huuuuge drawback you cant just ignore it opinions do not matter its just about what you get for your money in terms of performance it may well be the best but it is by far not the best smartphone i dont say oneplus produces the best smartphones but they are all better than pixel
Android,not_removed,yup thats an option too
Android,not_removed,im in canada
Android,not_removed,are they selling the phone at carries in the states in canada all the major providers are selling
Android,not_removed,not when im mostly using my phone on the move constant in and out of tunnels and flights make streaming impossible also use more battery and im usually on a restricted data plan a month
Android,not_removed,yes the price is a drawback and why i hope the pixel is going to be available to buy from all us carriersother than that your point falls apart you even say it may be the best performing phone what else do you need phones are at the point where they need to perform well because everything else is practically within the same range on all flagships
Android,not_removed,currently only verizon is selling it possibly some exclusivity deal
Android,not_removed,yeah but why would you want that
Android,not_removed,there is more than just performance it may be the best performing phone doesnt mean it may be the best phone the price is important and in terms of that its one of the worst dont ignore the greatest flaw just because youd like your phone to be the best confirmation bias
Android,not_removed,why not the device is unlocked either way
Android,not_removed,bootloader cant be unlocked on anything other than one bought from google in the us
Android,not_removed,who cares where you buy it
Android,not_removed,you literally just responded to my response on why people would only buy from google
Android,not_removed,i responded to the wrong person on reddit the horror how could i do such a thing
Android,not_removed,better performance is good but the limiting factor for mobile gaming will always be control and battery life the medium is limited by the fact that most users are only going to have touch screen controls which do not translate well to most of the genres that have traditionally dominated the video games industry there has been a lot of progress and a lot of thinking outside the box in this respect the past couple of years but i still think there is some ways to go
Android,not_removed,if androidgoogle doesnt get control of the bullshit that gets accepted on the marketplace this will be a missed experience by me i have seen enough clash of kings and clans and warrior games to make me not even waste my time on timers in app purchases and must have facebook to use etc whatever happened to just a good story and well made platformer i know there are some good ports from the pc and other systems that make you pay a bit morebut id rather have that than the current trend of get rich quick developers making regurgitated money grab garbage products they call games edit added google who bought android from android inc since i had a piss poor attempt at being trolled by one individual umegablast what a waste of time replying to his shite
Android,not_removed,i hope they all really take on vulkan
Android,not_removed,cant wait to download candy crush hd saga
Android,not_removed,just to note that qualcomms adreno which is bundled on the snapdragon already supports vulkan if every manufacturer embraces vulkan that will be a huge step for mobile gaming
Android,not_removed,this is some very exciting news for mobile and the tech world if mobile phones start supporting vulkan we may see a move in pc gaming where devs may develop more games for vulkan instead of just microsoft directx
Android,not_removed,are there vulkan api development resources and tutorials somewhere
Android,not_removed,so are there games that work with the vulkan api already i have been waiting for this since the launch but have not found anything
Android,not_removed,i totally thought this game looked like star craft for a second i wish we had a game like star craft on the play store
Android,not_removed,vulkan the only thing that will make me buy a new phone this year
Android,not_removed,rtitlegore
Android,not_removed,this wont matter unless all the game devs hop in to take advantage of vulkan apis however the problem is this is going to take at least years become mainstream graphics api on android
Android,not_removed,since nintendo is basically dead now compared to microsoft and sony they should bring their titles to mobile im sure kids would still pay to play the latest pokemon or mario games on their iphones or androids i think the same way that the ipod died when the iphone came out mobile gaming has the power to do the same alot of people have mentioned controllers as a major road block but what if microsoftsonynintendo put their games on phones and only manufactured controllers instead of consoles it would be better for the companies in the long run too
Android,not_removed,you are not completely right here vulkan is more powerefficient than opengl es it does save battery you mustve missed the vainglory part of video the game has all the same visuals no new effects were added but runs more smoothly because it utilizes hardware more efficiently cpu usage is always lower with vulkan since it is more lowlevel better battery life and when framerate reaches that fps cap a few gpu cores may even idle for a few cycles again improving power usage and all of this is only because of more efficient rendering pipeline vulkan provides as for touch input i agree with you the only games that feel natural on phonestablets are racing ones with tilt steering
Android,not_removed,yeah honestly gaming on phones is still trash for anything other than very simplistic games like clickeridle games or simple puzzles if i know im going to need to kill time gaming when im on the move then it really isnt too much hassle to throw my into my bag
Android,not_removed,it pisses me off how we have android as good mobile platform and all the brand names are making fucking tv consoles other than the aging nvidia shield handheld and ancient xperia play the only options for a handheld android gaming console is chinese off brands i know its niche and would be expensive but id buy a decent android handheld console in a heartbeat it would be great for games
Android,not_removed,hopefully the control situation will be very easy once usbc takes over everything you will be able to plug your usbc xboxplaystation controller into your usbc android phone without adaptors
Android,not_removed,for heavy gaming like modern combat the limiting factor is thermal control devices get hot and throttle quickly which results in a poor framerate and a poor gaming experience to get around that i turn off throttle control for the gpu and take cooling into my own hands with an ice pack
Android,not_removed,i think this is more for vr
Android,not_removed,i actually think touch controls work pretty well in a lot more genres than they get credit for for example i got quiet used to them in platform games as long as you dont need to press more than two action buttons plus the dpad and had no problem playing even more difficult platformer like vvvvvv dual stick controls work very well on touch screens and translate good to all kinds of eagles eye isometric games including zelda clones diablo clones or gta i ii clones what really doesnt work are first person shooters although i am curios if touch could change that all of those of course only if implemented right imo the big problem of mobile games is monetization just look through the play store to see how bad many core games sell privacy is a big problem and so is the unwillingness of most phone tablet owners to pay more than dollar for a game the only people that really make money in that space are small indie developer with a viral marketing hit like flappy bird or free to play garbage developer to get back to the topic i also doubt that a better graphic api will make much of a difference well maybe it reduces costs for porting from pc a bit which could result in a few good quality games better graphics though not important in a space in which asphalt from is still often in top graphics videos better performance performance would probably ok for most users if developers included resolution scaling options into their games
Android,not_removed,android has control of that bullshit its at the top because people are downloading it thats also why quality mobile games are so rare nobody is buying them the quality stuff is out there it will get much better because of vulkan but it will almost never get to the tops of the lists
Android,not_removed,i feel like the only solution would be a separate android gaming market like a steam for android with better moderation right now if i wanted to find good android games id use humble bundle
Android,not_removed,whatever happened to just a good story and well made platformer there are plenty out there you seem to be ignoring them why dont you ask yourself why you are ignoring them
Android,not_removed,in
Android,not_removed,woo linux it could actually be a very lucrative business too make a decent looking game in vulkan and then port it with the growing number of android consoles and make more money
Android,not_removed,httpsgithubcomgooglesamplesandroidvulkantutorials
Android,not_removed,hopefully they wont be samsung exclusive
Android,not_removed,vainglory
Android,not_removed,its vainglory hands down the best touch based moba
Android,not_removed,nintendo is currently working on titles for mobile not just ports though theyre making games specifically for mobile animal crossing and pokemon go are the two that i know of its a good sign of things to come
Android,not_removed,yeah ive never come across anyone who plays real hardcore games on their phone it just doesnt have the ergonomics of a handheld touch screens have their limit with how awkward controls can get and then you end up needing a controller which is too much for the vast majority of consumers i mean im glad theyre innovating but i really dont expect much to come of this in terms of mobile games bridging closer to full pcconsole ones both visuals and gameplay
Android,not_removed,i had always thought it would be a good business move for nintendo everyone had been asking nintendo if they considered mobile gaming a threat if they planned on making mobile games if they would give up on traditional handheld consoles if they did they are making mobile games but its a really halfassed approach what if they could instead pave the road for highend android gaming make their own version of android that has a traditional dsesque experience but give it all the benefits of an android device give it a nintendo marketplace app to buy games let it read old cartridges even give developers a reason to make quality android games in the first place
Android,not_removed,the new xbox one s controllers will use bluetooth so you probably dont even need to worry about typec im pretty sure the controller already does too
Android,not_removed,you can currently use your playstation controller without usb type c you just need a usb otg adapter and root on nonplaystation certified devices like the highend xperias
Android,not_removed,google likes it how it is iap pulls in bucketloads of money for example they could offer a noiap category but they dont or only allow a limited number of iap that could only be bought once
Android,not_removed,truethe grazing sheep are to blame
Android,not_removed,its at the top because people are downloading it its at the top because bots are downloading and rate it ftfy google play is a no mans land main activity on play is bots pumping up rating of crap apps from noname publishers
Android,not_removed,thats not a bad idea actuallya separate game store for qualitymaybe steam would entertain that idea with the new vulkan stuff
Android,not_removed,no im aware of maybe a dozen vs thousands of rehashed copied bs why do you like pointing the finger and trying to bash someone i never discredited the existence of good games i said i know theyre out therebut not compared to the crap that people seem to enjoy
Android,not_removed,and it doesnt have a ridiculous grind i have nearly enough for a champ for a few hours of gameplay daily free lootboxes its probably the first mobile game in lords how long or first that i play semi regularly when im out and about
Android,not_removed,the biggest problem is that touch controls make you cover the display with your fingers so theres less usable screen and yeah if the solution to that is bring a controller then the better solution is bring an actual portable console
Android,not_removed,my controller and i hope youre wrong but youre probably correct
Android,not_removed,i actually played through kotor last year wouldnt recommend it though the controls were severely lacking
Android,not_removed,i totally agree i would much rather have something from the heart of nintendo rather than having to use emulators
Android,not_removed,xbox one controllers that use bluetooth sounds too good to be true i personally prefer the layout of the left stick on xbox controllers but i dont want to buy their adapter to be able to use one
Android,not_removed,you will be able to plug your usbc xboxplaystation controller into your usbc android phone without adaptors that was the whole point of my post currently the controller situation on android is pitiful because you need adaptors with usbc becoming widespread it will be far more enticing to use a controller since it will be a seamless experience where you can just plug it into your phone no problem not to mention bluetooth like the other person said
Android,not_removed,i used it via otg cable even wo root on httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomfdeavpevolutionhlen supports controller
Android,not_removed,you can even do it using bluetooth if youre root its quite useful and well recognized by most games
Android,not_removed,at least they list when an app has iap now but it would be great if they listed what the iaps are like the apple appstore does
Android,not_removed,why are you trying to bash what people enjoy i mean i dont like those popular games either but who are we to say that other games are more deserving
Android,not_removed,absolutely my controllers pair just fine and there are plenty of controller mounts but theyre physically bigger to bring with me than a or psv if im gonna bring something that size with me why wouldnt i be in the one thats dedicated console and not going to leave me uncontactable when the battery dies
Android,not_removed,its true though but will also carry the old ir for the older one consoles to
Android,not_removed,httpsxboxdesignlabxboxcomxrshellnav
Android,not_removed,ahhh i mustve missed the part the where you said without adapters sorry about that
Android,not_removed,never said i was right youre reading a bit to far into my original commentreaching for some high ground or something
Android,not_removed,the xbox one doesnt use ir it uses some proprietary form of wifi direct to communicate with controllers the original xbox one controllers had ir reflectors for use with the kinect but those were removed when they added the headphone jack
Android,not_removed,thats kind of expensive i guess ill either wait for the price to go down or just get myself a regular xbox one controller and use a microusb to usb c converter thanks though
Android,not_removed,mate you are talking shit what do you want android wtf to control then
Android,not_removed,ah gotcha mine is the original original so if i got a new controller that would help my little distance issue i sit about feet from mine and time to time it disconnects from the xbox
Android,not_removed,thats because is the design lab edition where you can customize the colors of the controller i expect a normal version just all whiteblack httpwwwxboxcomenusxboxones that should be cheaper
Android,not_removed,lol youre not comprehending at all op or my upvoted to what we want to see android do with the game store no need to get all pissy now you came out swinging
Android,not_removed,ah good thanks
Android,not_removed,what the fuck does android have to do with it genius it is the google play store google are the ones in charge
Android,not_removed,you just like to argue heres some facts moron android was initially authored by android inc which google bought in and unveiled it in can call it either one now same owner go write a thesis or something mate everyone else seemed to understand except you but youre the one making an ass of yourself lol holy shit my reddit entertainment for the day
Android,not_removed,so you really have no idea the different between android and the play store is
Android,not_removed,done replying to you you cant even troll properly google owns android google is the playstore its full of crap end of discussion with you gday mate go to work or something
Android,not_removed,sorry i just figured out that maybe english isnt your first language it is just confusing when you talk about android an operating system controlling the play store
Android,not_removed,i know what it is i was referring to it as a prior company called android incthat google bought youre trying to grab for fallacies in my original commentit isnt working for your sake i hope your naive and a teenager not a grown adult
Android,not_removed,im not sure if these chips will change much the seems to be a modified or even just binned version of one of their lowerend socs i wonder if the is similar
Android,not_removed,industry leading in their own article sounds like httpsiimgurcommnuipmupng to me are we getting scared last years socs damanged the reputation
Android,not_removed,well they are objectively industry leading so i wouldnt make a fuss about that and specially not an rr martin quote about it

Android,not_removed,the nexus had a vibration motor id describe as a thud instead of a buzz yes taptic engine is just a marketing term its just a vibration motor provides haptic feedback i do prefer thuds over buzzes i hope this is the direction pixel goes
Android,not_removed,the way you described the haptic feedback is exactly how any vibration motor works because its a marketing term its a very good vibration motor but thats still what it is
Android,not_removed,each thud on that glass back felt beautiful
Android,not_removed,most vibration motors work by spinning a lopsided weight around they cant generate a single impulse because however fast they are they still have to spin up and down a linear actuation can generate a single impulse at full strength instantly
Android,not_removed,that is not used anymore and phones use the same lra tech that is used in the onwards
Android,not_removed,do you have a source or anything that compares vibration motors in phones like the op the taptic engine is unlike any other feedback ive felt in a phone especially when using things like dialsspinners
Android,not_removed,do you have a source or anything that compares vibration motors in phones ive seen the insides of phones and can see what they use you are not wrong though apples is the best it really is excellent but the underlying tech is the same
Android,not_removed,i was under the influence that most vibration engines didnt have a z axis to them and again do you have a source for most phones switching if so why hasnt the feel of the vibration changed it cant be purely software apple had to make space for the larger part
Android,not_removed,this is the vibration motor of the theyre are all lra motors this is the old style
Android,not_removed,am i missing something both of those are round and look nothing like the taptic engine apple uses here is the taptic engine
Android,not_removed,lra can come in a square shape its the same tech
Android,not_removed,no lra motor spins these and the tactic engine are lra motors
Android,not_removed,the and ones are clearly round regardless what apple is using is clearly different
Android,not_removed,i stand corrected just watched a video til
Android,not_removed,lra is a new type of vibrator unit which has recently been adopted into smartphones it stands for linear resonant actuator it uses a completely different mechanism compared to erm the general shape is similar to that of a small button cell but can come in all shapes and sizes rectangles in the iphone and iphone plus imore
Android,not_removed,httpimorecomsciencebehindtapticsandforcetouch if i understand that article right apple was using lra in the iphone which doesnt have the taptic engine the taptic engine is what presses back it creates a haptic response — which is a fancy way of saying physical feedback in this case the haptics are generated by an lra linear resonant actuator akin to the one used in the iphone and iphone plus so clearly the taptic engine is more than lra
Android,not_removed,it literally says right there the feedback is generated by an lra the thing i am saying it uses
Android,not_removed,the engine is driven using lra the iphone uses lra and doesnt have haptic feedback at least not like the taptic engine there is more to haptic feedback than simply using lra to drive the vibration
Android,not_removed,nope apples taptic engine is just a real nice linear resonant actuator with a lot of control in its intensity and brevity still just an lra though
Android,not_removed,what im not saying that it isnt lra im saying that it takes more than an lra motor to provide the type of feedback that the taptic engine provides to make an analogy almost all cars are combustion engines but not all combustion use the same action see wankel versus piston engine
Android,not_removed,i dont mean this in a negative way i wish links to youtube videos included the name of the reviewers so we could know whether or not we want to click on them yeah i know its just a second or two of wasted time on a desktop its a little bit more annoying on a mobile phone to have clicked on something i wouldnt want to watch in the case of this thread there were no comments to give me an idea its krystal key if youre wondering

Android,not_removed,i want something like this i dont need it but i want it
Android,not_removed,theres tons of other chinese tablets that can dual boot but bucks for an added projector i dunno about this
Android,not_removed,is this one of the first atombased windows mobile phones to be released
Android,not_removed,idea is awesome but smells like vapor ware
Android,not_removed,a little high but hey more power to ya my and my dell xps and going strong so i got best of both worlds except my laptop wont make it past two hours with a cell battery thats what i get for getting a though and dont regret it
Android,not_removed,i dont think they actually sold that many and i agree with youi cant see a huge market for something like this with this mix of specifications for what you get for the price you might as well get an actual small projector a tablet and a phone
Android,not_removed,i loved the nexus ads
Android,not_removed,droid is goat
Android,not_removed,wish they had gotten a more appropriately matched voice for the video but the concept and visuals were pretty good i remember liking the old og droid stuff but i cant remember what it was really and it was more teaser stuff rather than feature walkthroughs like this was
Android,not_removed,this would make a terrible ad would an average consumer want to sit through a and a half minutes video while watching a phone turn around on a background laser lights its a nice informative video something that would accompany a product page listing not something that plays on tv or before a youtube video
Android,not_removed,that oneplus video is actually really really good
Android,not_removed,although not a specific smartphone ad but is my favorite
Android,not_removed,nice try one plus marketing team nice try
Android,not_removed,this is more a listing of specs than an ad
Android,not_removed,the christmas one for the was really good
Android,not_removed,if you want the smoothest experience of android the general consensus is that stock android is the way to go which would be a pixel phone
Android,not_removed,first of all you will not have to worry about itunes if you switch computers add music or videos to your phone switch to a pc manage the file typesize i could go on to add musicvideos from your computer to your phone just plug in your phone find its respective folder and drag and drop thats my personal favorite
Android,not_removed,youre fear is very justified the best part about android tho is the fact that you arnt locked down when it comes to default apps so you can try and experiment until you find the experiences that work best for you
Android,not_removed,or htc which has very close to stock if you want some sort of skin the u ultra and the are just as fast if not equals to the pixel
Android,not_removed,i like the title of this so have my upvote also as much as the people who make predictions get shit on for causing false hype i think talking about the possibilities is one of the most fun things to do before a product launch as long as you remember to rein in your expectations
Android,not_removed,my take all google needs to do to win my interest is address the misbehaviors in android and nexus phones stop wake locks address runaway battery drain and provide an honest to god good camera app experience because google camera sucks great battery life decent performance no glitches top of the line camera experience if they can do all that with the boring ugly devices showing up in the leaks im golden i have my doubts
Android,not_removed,ive come to the conclusion that google while quirky and questionable at times arent dumb people at google are smart but yeah google is that dumb sometimes its a paradox for the age heres my bet the pixel line will be just as the leaks have shown complete with the run of the mill specs weve all seen leaked there will be no bling no surprises no light up trackballs no notification lights no wireless charging no trackpad on the back man thatd be dumb the camera will be fine but will fail actual world shootouts with the iphone and galaxies its going to be just a regular phone but they will include the always listening stuff you mentioned which will basically be the allo chatbot as some voice activated ok google thing except theyll rename it maybe theyll make the keyword allo google so we can all sound like cockney brits but seriously that will be their only gimmick the google special software sauce theyve been hyping and teasing always listening allo and it will be underwhelming to all good night
Android,not_removed,i want to believe in everything you said but theres a side of me saying that google changed their plans in the middle of everything yeah just like android silver x nexus and didnt have the time to make thing great so it may be a expensive device with low to zero enhancements and yes google may be that dumb sometimes
Android,not_removed,my prediction is that there will be surprises inside this phone i do find it kind of funny that so many people judge the phones based on what they look like and not what is inside my dream feature would be google putting their tpu tensorflow processor in these phones enabling offline and materially better voice recognition improved accuracy but also vastly lower latency a lot does depend on if the rumored price is correct but if it is then there really has to be something extra with these phones or at least something google thinks is extra and valuable i also believe these phones will have very good cameras as in getting an or higher on dxo they are rumored to be using a sony camera part that has a sensor that should help provide very good low light performance
Android,not_removed,i think the main two areas i agree with you are the speaker setup and the emphasis on software i dont expect a lightbar wireless charging is a big maybe in my opinion and i expect the camera to be about iphone level and at most will match samsung rather than beat their camera im not expecting touch but i am expecting a software alternative to it i think youre right about the assistant stuff im sure google will include something none of us were expecting maybe nothing groundbreaking but something to differentiate
Android,not_removed,if the pixel is anything like the rumors suggest ill be ignoring it the design language suggested is pretty bad the bezels are larger than the yet dropping front facing speakers jack still on top everything about it looks ugly on top of having fewer useful features to me my hype is at an all time low right now
Android,not_removed,people are still talking about the chins even though the comparisons show them no bigger than existing phones i do hope there is a light bar though
Android,not_removed,my unpopular prediction this phone will fail to gain traction with mainstream people only people in this sub will eat it up hardware its going to be exactly how the leaks look completely underwhelming and boring like an iphone clone camerabattery will also be underwhelming and unacceptable for a device software wise it will pretty much be like nexus devices with a couple of gimmicky ask google functions which will be buggy and bad predictive abilities people will hype it up only to never be used again after a couple of months carrier bloat will also exist on it as google still cant control carriers to play ball with android and they will only promise years worth of delayed updates going to be like verizon galaxy nexus all over again too little too late google were in a galaxy and iphone world and youre not invited you lost control of android
Android,not_removed,google hit a home run with the so i have some degree of optimism they literally only need to replace the pathetic dac add ois to the camera and adopt a faster storage standard like samsung and apple have thats literally all i need to be impressed and preorder
Android,not_removed,you can create a bingo for that
Android,not_removed,honestly i believe the hype and advertising for the announcement alone is a sign of desperation it almost feels like google is aware that these phones will not appeal to the same people in the nexus consumer base and are hoping that by over hyping and pushing advertising to maximum levels that they could try and gain sales of the device in the main consumer market i mean for fucks sake if it is especially true about the verizon carrier exclusivity it further drives that point that they are trying to push this phone more in the public eye than any other nexus device ever had before plus knowing the history google had with verizon and how they have handled their devices it is a matter of worry on how much they really care about the long term support of this device in the end the device will likely not scratch the surface of sales and google will have to rethink their approach on these devices worse case scenario you will hear normals trying to call it the galaxy pixel
Android,not_removed,but what about daydream it seemed like a big deal at io
Android,not_removed,none of this seems out of the realm of possibilities htc is making these phones so to have their speakers wouldnt be shocking galaxy nexus and nexus and maybe had a large led dot on the center of the bottom bezel and pixel devices have had light bars too apple has a pressure sensitive display and companies have made the components to make one for android just the software has lacked also back in an earlier developer preview they were toying with the idea of shortcuts on launcher icons as for the software i think they are going to refine the stuff the nexus hasand struggles with i would expect display when picked up to light up more reliably voice commands to work better camera open speed to decrease along with the new features they will add in
Android,not_removed,oh my your mind is so unique im surprised no one else has made a list like this yet on here
Android,not_removed,for fucks sake man
Android,not_removed,agreed predictions should be taken with a grain of salt its always nice to have hype but moderately enough that crazy expectations dont ruin your impression of the real deal its always nice to dream
Android,not_removed,thanks im just trying to start a conversation ya know hype trains are fun until they get derailed
Android,not_removed,agreed there has been a lot of shitposts in the recent months and i agree with the title honestly im skipping this launch out because the nexus is everything i want i might upgrade to the one though i just really want google to succeed with this launch i think google really needs to let people know google is android i cant name how many times i had to explain to people that google makes android i mean we are talking about a platform that been around for years yet people still dont even understand that little bit of information google should do a video starting off like since here at google we have bult an amazing operating system that works on thousands devices something like that to emphasize they are the makers of android
Android,not_removed,certainly not getting great battery life with a unit im in the please make the phone thicker and put in a unit
Android,not_removed,top of the line camera experience google leave fancy ccd sensors and lenses to others and just build a great phone not a glorified camera
Android,not_removed,stop wake locks address runaway battery drain that cant happen it is fundamental to the way android was built it hasnt changed and i knew it couldnt change which is why i left android years ago
Android,not_removed,its called google assistant not always on allo allo is just an overly hyped messaging app that happens to have a preview version of the google assistant which is basically a more intelligent version of google now but on everything else i have the same unfortunate expectations add to the fact that aside from the pixel phones we will also see google homechromecast ultramiboxthe laptop andor tablet that uses the god only knows andromeda os and a few other things because lets be honest here if they were going to make this all about the phones the hype would have died before the end of the conference on tuesday
Android,not_removed,ha and google accomplishes their goal of becoming apple courage
Android,not_removed,but it will have a audio jack and aosp android which is all im asking for
Android,not_removed,i must be the only one that thinks itd be cool if the back glass plate was a track pad to be used in desktop mode on andromeda
Android,not_removed,i want to believe in everything i said too
Android,not_removed,those are my thoughts exactly i dont think google would be so stupid as to just put a high asking price without backing it up there has got to be something that makes the phone worth it it would be very unwise to alienate their main base of nerds and techies just to possibly get mainstream appeal
Android,not_removed,i dont mind the chin i am annoyed to hell that they moved the htc buttons onscreen though its like they said hey this phone ia too useful lets change that and add no other value
Android,not_removed,my unpopular prediction this phone will fail to gain traction with mainstream people only people in this sub will eat it up just like nexus phones really which are virtually unknown outside power user forums
Android,not_removed,who did this to you
Android,not_removed,id give them the benefit of the doubt theyve had more than their fair share of humble pie when it came to devices in the past the pixel phones are way too big to mess up
Android,not_removed,why would the camera and battery be unacceptable the nexus did great on both of those fronts even today with the camera
Android,not_removed,oh shit i just wrote almost the exact same post
Android,not_removed,honestly this is too fucking real youll be getting downvotes for a few reasons this is android and people obsess over google phones youre saying negative things about google phones youre telling this prediction to a fan base that has next to no concept that people have no fucking idea google even makes phones serious everything hit the nail on the head a battery thats easily sot the pixel xl may be up to note battery standards but youre next to paying note price and missing half a dozen perks oh my gurrd its touchwiz sux ok let me slap nova on there or change the theme or use good lock which is ridiculous close to stock the software any logical person knows google adopts things from other phones that were gimmicky or pointless but magically turned amazing now its on google the carrier bloat well duh
Android,not_removed,iphone clone i wish a dedicated home button is what people buy onscreen means it will barely be known outside of this sub
Android,not_removed,it sounds like youre describing blackberry from yesteryear rather than todays google i dont think google is that desperate they know how get a product out there if they really want to worst come to worse they could force us all to watch second pixel ads before every youtube video but in any case there is no reason for them to be desperate yet i think they have always wanted to tread carefully so that phone makers kept using their software thats part of the reason they are always one of the last to release their phones or they come out with a budget option its a strange game of having to compete with the people you dont want to piss off as far as verizon exclusivity that would be a detrimental mistake and a very poor decision their last experience really wasnt that long ago and it would be extremely asinine to have there only phone be tied to a single carrier
Android,not_removed,i pride myself on having a unique mind and ground breaking thoughts i like to think im a revolutionary of sorts
Android,not_removed,honest question why is it important to you that others know google makes android more importantly how do you think this it would change user behavior to know they are using android vs galaxy
Android,not_removed,i think google really needs to let people know google is android i cant name how many times i had to explain to people that google makes android yeah but why to you buy niche products and not just a galaxy if you dont want an iphone samsung os is pretty good
Android,not_removed,why not iphone batteries arent big and have good battery life
Android,not_removed,camera is important to people people no longer see a smartphone as just a bw nokia phone
Android,not_removed,opo woohoo are you sure
Android,not_removed,its completely possible if google is not relying on unmodified stock android which i cant believe they would given the rumors there are already discussions of pixelspecific features and ui elements plus differentlysegregated partitions for the os
Android,not_removed,it isnt due to how android works it is a bug which google can sort out
Android,not_removed,wakelocks are a boon in some specific use cases if you are a developer but it is a very powerful tool which shouldnt be used lightly if wakelocks are removed android would be just like ios where lots of cool stuff can never happen in the background
Android,not_removed,good point i forgot they already named google now to assistant yep always listening conversation assistant thats what they think people want and thats another good point they will for sure show off a bunch of home and chromecast stuff to distract from the dull phone
Android,not_removed,well there you go keep the dream of living in alive man
Android,not_removed,nah lots of people here would like that its giving me moto atrix flashbacks though
Android,not_removed,ive met several people that arent power users that had nexus phones and ive met plenty more that know what they are
Android,not_removed,continual disappointment by google its the same thing that happened to me
Android,not_removed,randroid hype did this to him
Android,not_removed,rumors we still dont know a lot about i havent seen any leaks in that regard besides the new launcher
Android,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqpnvtjtpyig
Android,not_removed,i would love to be proven wrong ive given google too many chances on android devices from galaxy nexus to nexus i love google but i always get angry using android im so much happier using google services on my iphone and on the web
Android,not_removed,nexus battery great ok buddy
Android,not_removed,camera is amazing on my
Android,not_removed,this sub is actually hypercritical of google at times not sure where you got the idea that we worship at their altar or something
Android,not_removed,i hate when people are just petty for no reason he actually has very valid points google does have a history of disappointing people i totally with him on the carrier updates they seriously need to gtfo with the bloatware that no one likes and the obnoxious branding google needs to throw their weight around more somehow the advertising king cant advertise their own products to the masses this has been an interesting year for google though so lets see if they can keep it going but still sharpens pitchfork oils torch
Android,not_removed,it sounds like youre describing blackberry from yesteryear rather than todays google yeah google isnt a failing company their hardware isnt the most popular on the market they only have other cash cows to keep them going they may be desperate in some ways to make a more overwhelmingawesome phone but theyre not desperate to stay in business
Android,not_removed,because a certain company named after a fruit has not been doing this kind of thing since the early
Android,not_removed,if people believe samsung android and a new pixel phone launches lay person wont know hey this is a new android phone why would someone want to fork over dollars from a phone thats made by google if they dont even know google is the main selling point and the real reason android exist
Android,not_removed,im assuming s but it didnt come over well
Android,not_removed,except that they dont they have good standby time major apps like instagram and snapchat are waaaaay more optimised a guy on work may not notice the small battery life that iphone gives because his phone is on standby for a lot of the time this is why battery life is different from screen on time ask anyone who chews down an iphone from while actually using it same doesnt happen with bigger android batteries
Android,not_removed,so much better optimized compared to what google has been able to do android devices need a bigger battery
Android,not_removed,apple is able to optimize the hardware to match the software something google cant do also iphones have to be charged every night just like my android with a battery
Android,not_removed,yep iphone is my daily driver i tried my opo which as you can see i was very excited about but nope same old battery problems as when i had my nexus one
Android,not_removed,but still hasnt managed to since androids inception that doesnt instill me with a lot of confidence that they can sort it out
Android,not_removed,exactly thats why they can never go away
Android,not_removed,nope nope and nope
Android,not_removed,google now and google assistant arent the same thing get your facts straight
Android,not_removed,that is a dream apple courage
Android,not_removed,its still pretty damn rare percentage wise
Android,not_removed,same boat im getting so close to switching right now im basically hanging on to exactly two power user features the ability to record my calls and the ability to encrypt cloud files transparently with encfs
Android,not_removed,i certainly hope your wrong too i have a cracked moto that has tape on the screen to keep it falling apart not to mentions the terrible specs ive been holding out for this phone all year and i hope i dont have to end up going with a different brand
Android,not_removed,tbh it was great for me before the nougat update even on the dev previews i was getting around of sot and now i get like tops nothing compared to the of the zplay but still better than my old phone
Android,not_removed,the biggest downfall is camera speed something both samsung and apple have
Android,not_removed,interesting i suppose theyd fork over or not based on the fact that it is a good phone or not
Android,not_removed,yeah s of course it seems if you dont put the sign people immediately assume youre serious sent from my galaxy so much better than android s
Android,not_removed,and dont forget the screen has the resolution of a typical android phone from years ago helped with sonys phones its going to help with iphone
Android,not_removed,see this is part of the problem why dont we optimize android instead of just throwing a bigger battery for it to gulp down
Android,not_removed,apple does design their own processors but this isnt a prerequisite to optimizing software for an soc or an soc infrastructure android doesnt really do this at all because its generic and generally hardwareagnostic well assuming the hardware manufacturer releases drivers for that platform there is nothing stopping google from properly optimizing a pixel phone os for the soc and getting better battery life than current android phones do the has a lot of onchip capabilities that phones really dont use not entirely relevant but used as an example the has an onboard video eis engine that is more effective and efficient than the driverlevel or softwarelevel solutions current phones implement iirc maybe the lg is going to use it but none of the other oems do why honestly i dont know but im using this as an example that the current way android isis not optimized for current socs doesnt create a rule for what is possible on pixel phones
Android,not_removed,apple also optimizes their core processes much more diligently where are googles approach is less efficient
Android,not_removed,ever used kitkat marshmallow greenify and amplify combined
Android,not_removed,oh i have zero expectations that google will fix it im just pretty sure that they can and i really hope they will ive been fucked by it too often
Android,not_removed,whatever the hell they call it these days you know what i mean
Android,not_removed,true that but not virtually unknown
Android,not_removed,i love call recording insurance company tries to tell me they didnt promise me something nope i have that shit recorded
Android,not_removed,of course that applies but besides that it being made by the company that makes android would give it a better push thats why i think they keep saying made by google they are trying to emphasize they have direct control over it
Android,not_removed,exactly vs for smaller iphone and vs for bigger iphone thats lot of pixels difference lesser resolution helps in not straining the gpu to suck battery power
Android,not_removed,im pretty sure much of it has to do with apple matching the hardware to the software google cant do that unless they create a separate os just for the pixel phones
Android,not_removed,be careful with that ask a lawyer whether its admissible as evidence and whether it can help your case it might not even if making the recordings doesnt break any law anyway to me its extremely useful for recalling details without having to call the person again sometimes its not possible to ask again or it would make you look stupid or unprofessional
Android,not_removed,google can do that they can do whatever they want with android they can do whatever they want with the hardware they just dont have the patience to do that
Android,not_removed,in canada party consent is all thats necessary with no disclosure to other parties so as long as im part of a conversation it doesnt matter how many people are in it or whether they know im allowed to record it i cant however stop and record people in a hallway who im not talking to yeah exactly ive used my recordings just because i forgot what time i was supposed to be somewhere p
Android,not_removed,well with their nexuspixel phones sure they can do that but they cant optimize android for samsung and lg
Android,not_removed,ehhh sort of they can optimize android like crazy for snapdragon processors but not all android phones use snapdragon theres so much fragmentation
Android,not_removed,well yeah thats what we were talking about if they are looking to make a brand name phone then matching their os with their phones will make it easier to sell im not saying they need to change android just optimize if for their phones
Android,not_removed,exactly the devices that google controls are actually pretty much insignificant in the android market i dont think its reasonable to expect google to use perfectly every peripherals on every android devices what is android strength is also its achilles heel
Android,not_removed,jesus this sub is obsessed with optimization even though or more here havent a clue what that means ios is fundamentally different from android thats what gives it better battery life yeah ios is definitely better optimised for its hardware as it should its specialised vs general software than android is but that doesnt magically translate into the difference in idle battery life
Android,not_removed,jesus this sub is obsessed with optimization even though or more here havent a clue what that means ios is fundamentally different from android thats what gives it better battery life you spoke in alien language while contradicting yourself in english ios apps are much more optimised especially majorly used ones like instagram facebook and snapchat the bigger battery life is there because of nearzero drain on standby but screen on time is not as good as android
Android,not_removed,this is the thing optimizing even for a specific group of processors isnt the magic key to making snapdragon phones twice as fast as exynos
Android,not_removed,imo we dont really need optimization how about an option to whitelist apps when the phone is in standby allow us to list apps that will be completely stopped and shut down whenever we put the phone in standby and itll be as if the app is uninstalleddisabled until we open it up again
Android,not_removed,the problem isnt just apps running in standby its googles processes also shitting on everything and those are the things we shouldnt ever suffer from

Android,not_removed,and edit so i installed it for the sake of science nothings changed
Android,not_removed,all i want is the ability to open immediately to my local playlist sigh
Android,not_removed,whats new
Android,not_removed,minor text fixes
Android,not_removed,r
Android,not_removed,your title doesnt make any sense to me
Android,not_removed,personally ive always found that google maps was basically identical in usability compared to google maps
Android,not_removed,from what ive gotten youre saying why does it feel like google apps do things better than the competition personally i feel the opposite i always prefer the default email clients over gmail third party music app spotifyshuttle over google play music stock lg calendars over googles chromium tuga over chrome and likely more for the ios aspect of it my sister doesnt use much of googles stuff and theres really no good need over it safari will obviously be equal or better since its all the same engine icloud gets the job done no problem and is quite seamless apple music goes toe to toe with ease stock email client does just fine i see google as a great competitor but by no means a leader if were talking about apps
Android,not_removed,learn english your title is incomprehensible
Android,not_removed,edit nwcermind im the one thats confused about what you meant in the post ill keep what i wrote anyways for me google apps feels powerful and intuitive its clean and professional looking you must be confusing the os in ios youre stuck with using apples app if you want a reasonable workflow open a link in email safari open directions apple maps if you want to attach an image in an app apples camera roll in android you can select whatever app you want as your default if you dont like the stock offering just use something else launcher browser sms client email client maps photo viewer even universal sharing dialogue can be replaced
Android,not_removed,of course it does which google apps are better than google apps
Android,not_removed,the logic of google maps being basically identical to google maps is undeniable
Android,not_removed,i would hope that google maps is comparable to google maps
Android,not_removed,i prefer stock android apps almost all of the time i remember when i was on sense i did actually prefer the calendar they had to the stock google but now a days i think the google calendar is actually better im running a nexus phone though so gmail fully supports exchange so i have four email accounts setup in my gmail i subscribe to google play music and thats not the same its a pay service so you are going to use whichever one you are paying for it just makes more sense to use gpm on android because you have the integration and no commercials on youtube everywhere
Android,not_removed,on my moto g and a few newer phones the stock apps are google apps
Android,not_removed,well to be fair the question itself had some grammatical peculiarities d
Android,not_removed,its a strange question to ask but i thought id help out
Android,not_removed,ap and their latest news 😂
Android,not_removed,anyone know if itll be exclusive only to samsung phones
Android,not_removed,i remembered the last time i heard about sailfish was back when i owned an
Android,not_removed,if its anything like sonys aosp support it wont have a working fingerprint scanner and camera quality will drop
Android,not_removed,woah thats still going on cool
Android,not_removed,they should defo release it for more phones wonder how much effort it would be to release for all the z series surely if they want to capture some attention it cant be limited to one mid range x phone
Android,not_removed,i maybe the only one but i wish windows phone actually rise from the ashes with the surface phone because even with all the flaws is very nice to use and im tired of androidios after what amd did im getting excited about what suprises could bring
Android,not_removed,offtopic jolla should collab with nokia
Android,not_removed,interesting
Android,not_removed,its always been on xperia devices though i remember flashing it on my xperia play years ago unless im mixing some other os with this edit i knew i wasnt mixing it up
Android,not_removed,as someone unfamiliar to sailfish os what benefitskey differences does it have over say android or even tizen
Android,not_removed,are there any xperia phones for us folks on verizon
Android,not_removed,this shoud be interesting i have good hopes for this
Android,not_removed,yes anyways wanted to try a sailfish device my nexus is broken so i cant
Android,not_removed,i hope this also comes to the xa line only hope because i know its more likely for me to actually get a jolla from a garage sale than getting a sailfish port
Android,not_removed,fucking elop
Android,not_removed,til sailfish is still a thing
Android,not_removed,that was such a good phone outsold the stupid windows version without any advertising as well nokia really fucked up with that eh
Android,not_removed,it says its an official release in partnership with sony i doubt it would ruin the camera quality because you wont have to unlock the bootloader just like you didnt when installing the concept software
Android,not_removed,random as hell but i have to give you props for being able to survive without gapps
Android,not_removed,so no one would buy their phones again
Android,not_removed,you almost just said firefox os should collab with nokia no one wants nokia to fail nokia blackberry are names that need to play their cards just right to stay relevant xperia is done with us carriers so outside of unlocked they do sell unlocked us phones here their share isnt much now i will say that i applaud jolla and sailfish os for their work and think innovationcompetition is amazing but as far as market share they would likely hurt nokias comeback
Android,not_removed,possibly meizus flyme os but just as likely not im fairly certain ive seen sailfish ports for some xperia devices before
Android,not_removed,youre mixing it up
Android,not_removed,its a standard gnulinux distribution with all the things youd expect wayland systemd glibc instead of bionic rpm zypper as the package managers pulseaudio native apps are written with c and qt its ui is also very nice
Android,not_removed,you dont get stalked by google
Android,not_removed,xperia phones only work with gsm i think does verizon offer gsm service
Android,not_removed,only the iirc and thats old kit by now would still run nicely but you can probably get better for your money these days
Android,not_removed,kinda closed minded dont you think more options are always a good thing
Android,not_removed,nokia elop really fucked up with that eh ftfy
Android,not_removed,i loved my it had so much more potential too it was fluid and streamlined still more intuitive than ios an android imo
Android,not_removed,thats even more amazing fact when you consider it wasnt even sold in the major markets i had to import mine from some random ebay seller in porta rico
Android,not_removed,i dont know what do you need in gapps ill give you a floss alternative unless its games but even that there are awesome games on fdroid
Android,not_removed,what whend they switch to rpm maemo was all debian based
Android,not_removed,i dont really care about that googles services make my life much easierany other differences
Android,not_removed,if they do i havent heard anything
Android,not_removed,the isnt bad as long as you dont mind it being stuck on lollipop mine hasnt gotten an update in a very long time as its very typical of verizon to abandon phones the camera leaves something to be desired but the battery life is great and the phone is still pretty snappy
Android,not_removed,it depends if those options bring something useful and relevant to the table no more more more isnt actually good
Android,not_removed,whats the difference he guided the company into a very nice ditch now they are finally trying to crawl back out of it
Android,not_removed,well the main argument against android adoption by then nokia fans was how can they differentiate so they thought wp was a good choice in retrospect ehhhhh single percentage marketshare is awesome
Android,not_removed,yeah and they spent millions in advertising the windows version as well in london they went as far as using projectors to make a giant version of it too im glad windows mobile os has basically failed goes to show you cant just throw cash at an issue and expect to come out on top like when intel tried to enter the mobile market
Android,not_removed,it does if its a sony phone sony values their proprietary camera hals and image processing techniques a lot if you unlock the bootloader on any sony phone it actually removes these and replaces it with a lesser process its basically image processing drm
Android,not_removed,im under the impression it does for sony phones the partition that contains the proprietary camera processing gets deleted upon unlocking the bootloader
Android,not_removed,fdroid ftw if you really need some play published apps apkmirror is good but many have play service dependencies ive tried it and i wanted to shoot myself sadly google has me wrapped around their fingers damn beautiful bastards lol
Android,not_removed,new more secure os probably
Android,not_removed,well uwearssweaters wants verizon
Android,not_removed,i remember using the os for my nexus a while back and it was actually really beautiful and smooth while really intuitive compared to stock and touchwiz and lg ui etc thats value they made a homescreen launcher based on their os for normal android users but im sad to see they mustve stopped development
Android,not_removed,still remember about elops burning platform memo we have some brilliant sources of innovation inside nokia but we are not bringing it to market fast enough we thought meego would be a platform for winning highend smartphones however at this rate by the end of we might have only one meego product in the market what he failed to see is that he did not give meego enough time the nokia was refined with innovative software combined with beautiful hardware makes it a great device but he quickly announced that meego is going to be killed theres no way developers and consumers are going to buy a doa device and as you said even without those marketing and advertisements nokia sold the more than lumias even though the was more expensive this shows that the nokia has the right software has the right hardware but was sold in a terrible time and then symbian elop announced windows phone and then quickly killed symbian too quickly that consumers and developers wont invest their time on symbian same like meego and then elop receiving a € million bonus after nokia sold its mobile phone business to microsoft and he stepped down as the ceo and then came back to microsoft again it was as if it was planned all along my writings here could be wrongright though so feel free to disagree
Android,not_removed,i dont think new nokia has anything to do with the nokia of the windows mobile days its basically a chinese oem using the name under license
Android,not_removed,haha ikr they did shake the mobile world once on the lumia era but thats mostly the hardware innovations that speak most people that i knew was interested until they heard windows phone word and those who went with wp and bought lumias complained that theres no app for that sorry richard i shouldnt have told you to buy a lumia just because i want to try that sweet ois camera
Android,not_removed,to be fair im not convinced theyd have more than a single percentage marketshare of android if they went for that
Android,not_removed,they a foss app yalp store its a front end for play store if you really just miss the store you can use it
Android,not_removed,so just another way to say you dont get stalked by google which no one cares about
Android,not_removed,elop went to android first instead of microsoft but nokia wanted to keep their here line of apps instead so google said no source
Android,not_removed,and then symbian elop announced windows phone and then quickly killed symbian too quickly that consumers and developers wont invest their time on symbian same like meego actually symbian was their old os they had been using it since the beginning opinion ahead symbian was still very good it was clearly trying to stay with the times the new features in the then latest symbian were on par if not better than androidiphone its just that the funding for symbian was downsized much before the belle version came out end of opinion but anyways you are right about everything else even when i first bought during its launch we all in the community knew that it was doa and that elop was fucking up the company i am pretty sure even the guys at nokia knew what elops plan was when he was apponted the ceo talks of the triple e plans were everywhere in the community but i am glad that nokia is coming back now hope the sailfish team can make a deal with nokia and get together again to bring us a spiritual successor of the httpsptpbpwffrl httpsptpbpwwmgi both of them are still my most favorite phones with the being my most favoriteeven in the software department even compared to todays phones would gladly sell my phone and buy an if i can get it new in gb
Android,not_removed,no thats fairly accurate i remember this pretty well meego was ridiculously good faster and lighter than anything else on the market even though it was running on a dual or single cant remember core only thing it lacked was apps which really fucked it a lot of the features it had then are in android now like double tap the screen to wake the always on display stuff on a low power mode and the like its really a shame if i remember correctly they poured something like into developing it my first few phones were by nokia i loved my with its ridiculous camera as well symbian was just not ready for touch interfaces but was getting better had they kept on with meego i think theyd still be competitive today especially with the rumour mill saying meego was just going to support the google play store with an emulator so you had all the apps oh well microsoft might have acquired it but i wont buy anything they make and they have a lot of catching up to do now i feel
Android,not_removed,this oem is actually made up of a lot of nokia veterans though
Android,not_removed,not this shit again hmd is a finnish design company staffed with a lot of exnokians who have licenced the nokia name for smartphones for ten years they have contracted a subsidiary of the taiwanese company foxconn to manufacture the phones just as apple do with the iphone
Android,not_removed,cool phone oh its windows phone never mind then
Android,not_removed,apart from the drawbacks of windows phone i kinda liked my lumia when i had it still use it as a backup phone
Android,not_removed,this is new i didnt know about this so thanks for posting this some of his line wasnt exactly something i agree though wed be just another company distributing android thats not nokia we need to fight i mean if they can actually make the lumia with android they wouldnt be just another company distributing android they had great colorful hardware wireless charging super sensitive touch screen first ois in a phone and so on i am not saying they will be more successful going to android but at least they have better chance than going with windows phone
Android,not_removed,i dont know if i believe that google has never had a problem with oem apps existing alongside the google apps htc even packs or used to pack i havent bought one in a while their own app store on their phones if nokia wanted to pack here instead of some of the google apps while having other apps like the play store thatd be a nonstarter but they definitely could have been on there as well the article you refer to simply says rather vaguely google refused to give the worlds biggest phonemaker any advantages over its smaller partners and honestly who can blame them theyd already built a pretty good ecosystem with those partners why would they fuck them in favor of nokia who clearly needed google one hell of a lot more than google needed them
Android,not_removed,thats a bullshit excuse android is open sourced they could have sidestepped google and made their own fork of android in they could have even made their own app store and actually competed or they could have bundled multiple apps to do the same thing like samsung and others do
Android,not_removed,haha it seems i had bad wordings on that one i had a nokia with symbian anna and belle and i would still use it longer if it wasnt for the sluggish performance which was not symbians fault i loved my nokia i foolishly sold it for the lumia just because i believed in nokias new path so much for being a fanboy i loved it so much that if i have to buy between an used nokia and a new lumia for the same price just an example i would buy the edit gosh its really saddening to see your shattered still remember the white that phone was a beauty hope you could find one
Android,not_removed,did you ever see the it was pretty much just an with a hardware keyboard i loved it
Android,not_removed,i very much agree with what you said meego was different than others but yet was still enjoyable and easy to use swipe from left or right to minimize app swipe to down to close the app swipe up and hold it halfway reveals shorcut apps it wasnt perfect yes but its very refined and allows for no button navigation and surprisingly very smooth for a single core phone
Android,not_removed,i would buy an android spec updates slightly thinner bigger screen in a heartbeat
Android,not_removed,amazon tried that with the fire phone and failed
Android,not_removed,the problem is apis in google play services if you put out a phone without play services a lot of apps downright fail if you cant seamlessly replicate the play apis amazon tried this but many apps will crash or fail if say google maps isnt installed because in the app language it will invoke an api that expects maps to be there for it to function and google wont let a manufacturer have play services without having the suite of google apps installed not sure of the current state of this so yeah android is open source but google has made it difficult to be independent someone forking android away from the googleprovided aosp would result in crosscompatibility problems between the different forks developers would have to write their apps to work on both forks one with play service apis and one without or with other custom apis
Android,not_removed,ah yes holding on to my for nostalgia its in mind condition
Android,not_removed,i already had the when the came out after which i just shifted to the plus i previously owned the mini so the didnt seem as anything new at the time
Android,not_removed,i have this big cardboard box in which lay rest all my previous phone which died ranging from the to the latest would show a picture but its too deep to bother
Android,not_removed,serious question has there ever been a case of bad app on iphone not trying to stir up any hate but i have never heard of such thing
Android,not_removed,aagghh i factory reset my phone after seeing it drain out in hours only if ive seen this sooner
Android,not_removed,i had crazy battery drain after the update on my verizon note but it wasnt from the oculus app hangouts was set to be the default sms app by the update instead of textra and i wasnt getting text messages it was causing android system to drain the battery once i unchecked the box in hangouts and set my default sms app back to textra i started getting texts again and the cpu cooled down and battery life is back to normal
Android,not_removed,well damn i started deleting everything else already
Android,not_removed,how do you disable or uninstall the oculus app it wont let me
Android,not_removed,i have already uninstalled all the mentioned culprits my is discharging in about hours before the update i could get hours between charges any ideas what to do httpsimgurcomgmyqjdk
Android,not_removed,apparently there is already an update that fixed this
Android,not_removed,i freaked out for the longest time wondering why my phone stopped receiving texts and turned into a device that would burn to the touch luckily i was able to spot that the last thing my phone did was update that app which i quickly uninstalled therefore saving my phone after the drama of the note im very ashamed of samsung rolling out an update that clearly wasnt ready and assaulted our batteries theres no way that having a phone that hot for any duration can be healthy
Android,not_removed,oculus sent out a new update this morning it updated itself this morning before i saw this post so hopefully it fixes it edit just to clarify it updated to
Android,not_removed,glad im on the note lol
Android,not_removed,i dont have the oculus app enabled but in regards to overall battery life i dont know why my edges battery life fluctuates so much i went from an iphone to the edge and there are a lot of things i like about android and the samsung hardware but battery consistency was something that the iphone had the advantage in some days i lose of my battery in an hour when i check my phone after a class and i have no idea why nothing major was eating all the battery either installed greenify and i think it made the battery drainage worse just wish there was some consistency
Android,not_removed,for me it is the samsung gear vr service how can i uninstall it or deactivate it the button is greyed out it drained ℅ in
Android,not_removed,is anyone else bothered by the fact the oculus app updates itself disabling auto updates is only for the apps installed through oculus
Android,not_removed,woke up this morning to a nearly dead battery
Android,not_removed,goddamn it samsung what the hell are you doing
Android,not_removed,lol what should the other of the people do that experience these effects but dont have the app installed
Android,not_removed,is everyone decent at the samsung mobile department on fucking vacation or something
Android,not_removed,touchwiz ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,apps in ios have very little ability to do things at background an app doing something like this is impossible there are some cases with os updates though but apple wasis always willing to fix those without hassle
Android,not_removed,iirc the facebook app was bad in terms of battery drain on both android and ios
Android,not_removed,skype back in the day actually probably still these days i dont use it any more but i have no confidence in skype to make a good client app on any platform
Android,not_removed,snapchat kills my battery literally just turns my phone off if its anywhere below but only if its open it has no effect on my phone otherwise i guess ios apps have way less control if theyre not open so its not likely to do anything
Android,not_removed,i heard the facebook app is pretty bad on ios
Android,not_removed,yes its was called ios pre ios devices that were running iphone and ipad were absolutely demolished with the release of ios my ipad became so slow with ios even worse with that i sold it
Android,not_removed,yes back around ios a lot of apps would take multiple attempts to install
Android,not_removed,well at the same time lets apps like spotify or plex cant download in the background after more than a few seconds of moving away from the app ios doesnt offer true multitasking so thats not comparing applestoapples
Android,not_removed,there has and i remember having to reset to new my iphone a few times to stop bad drains
Android,not_removed,damn man i factory reset only after im totally out of ideas you are way for willing to reset than i am
Android,not_removed,i did the same took a different phone to work yesterday and came home to a warm edge this coupled with generally laggy and slow performance i angrily backed up all my photos and texts and factory reset the thing oh well im hoping performance gets better as a result guess well see
Android,not_removed,i did the same man i was thoroughly upset i forgot to move all my photos to my sd card
Android,not_removed,you were having problems with hangouts sms yesterday because i was having the same issue on my note wasnt able to receive texts and a lot of my texts wouldnt go out either
Android,not_removed,i had this same exact issue all day it was so annoying i was receiving texts but it wasnt sending mine out and also had a huge battery drain it died within hours yesterday morning i was getting so frustrated its a relief to know that im not the only one
Android,not_removed,same on my i had to rollback the latest good lock update made my battery life way worse
Android,not_removed,i just got a new update from good lock that fixed this check the samsung store
Android,not_removed,i use package disabler pro to disable the things i cant uninstall or disable
Android,not_removed,dat wakelock tho
Android,not_removed,oops already deleted it i guess ill redownload when i need to use gear vr
Android,not_removed,my note got incredibly hot and slow yesterday for a few hours crazy battery dain and the battery took almost an hour to increase percent in charge i turned my phone off and let it cool completely but as soon as i booted up the heat was back all of a sudden after a few hours after the symptoms started my phone cooled off and my battery charged as quickly as it usually does
Android,not_removed,i uninstalled everything related to gear vr and oculus then for the things i cant uninstall or disable i bought package disabler pro and disabled everything related to vr that works for me
Android,not_removed,you have good lock installed right update to version if that doesnt help uninstall it
Android,not_removed,contributing to global warming
Android,not_removed,this is the one thing i dont like about my exynos background apps run like crazy almost every day something gets stuck running in the background if i dont catch it early my battery gets killed otherwise i get like hours sot it happened occasionally when i had my but with the i have to be on alert at all times its pretty annoying but the other than that the phone is great
Android,not_removed,the thing i dont understand is that if i send my friend an email or a snapchat or a message through whatsapp he instantly receives it so apps definitely do work in the background
Android,not_removed,i have had plenty of problems with my ios devices over the years its always so far to do with google accounts syncing with the inbuilt emailcalendarcontact apps something gets stuckplays silly buggers and then battery starts to drop or so its an absolute pain in the bum when it happens and the only way to reliably fix it is to restore and install from scratch and not from backup
Android,not_removed,a loophole on fbs end taking advantage of legitimate ios functions it was shitty of them for sure
Android,not_removed,as another poster alluded to facebook abused audio apis to keep their app more active in the background by playing a silent audio file constantly so the app was never properly slept just another example of facebooks incredibly arrogant and quite frankly lazy coding methodology
Android,not_removed,skype is still a shit service on every platform it is available on desktop included cant wait for the inevitable addition of video calling and screen sharing to discord
Android,not_removed,that hasnt been true in years apps can download or do anything else as of ios in the background
Android,not_removed,wrong wrong and wrong
Android,not_removed,takes me so long to restore things to how i like them i try to avoid at all costs
Android,not_removed,i was just about to reset my phone before seeing this thread good thing i waited the phone cooled down within minutes of uninstalling the app
Android,not_removed,im the same way ill pull the reset trigger real quick
Android,not_removed,ive got a good luck update parked in todays queue right now when did you update
Android,not_removed,have you noticed any battery draining using that app i had it but read that people got worse battery when using it
Android,not_removed,not even sure what that is it wasnt one of the main ones this morning
Android,not_removed,ah makes sense then
Android,not_removed,it happened with me the other day too had to take my battery out and let it cool off at least its not explodingbut it was concerning as ive already had to replace the battery once think its back to normal toobut i dont know what that could have been from as my phone is completely updated
Android,not_removed,this have never happened to me pretty always get good batterylife from the exynos version
Android,not_removed,in the settings you can limit the amount of backround apps so only the ones youre using regularly will run in the backround
Android,not_removed,is there a difference in background performancelimiting on an exynos processor versus a qualcomm one for instance an
Android,not_removed,does it not have a built in process killer ive got a note and once or twice a day itll kill everything running that isnt loaded in the recent apps multitasking menu seems to work great seeing as how ive been off a charger for hours and still have you might have to turn it on somewhere unless there are some processes you dont want to be killed of course maybe theres a blacklist for them
Android,not_removed,push notifications are different perhaps someone smarter than me can explain
Android,not_removed,i dont know how whatever developer came up with that thought that it would give people the reaction of facebook opens so quick its great and not facebook makes my phone run like shit its a piece of garbage
Android,not_removed,this shit again set a spotify playlist to sync move away from the app for come back and tell me how it went similar to wp they give the illusion of multitasking it gets them most of the way to true multitasking but not there another example launch something mint of you have many accounts added and a few secs are not enough for refreshing and do the same test
Android,not_removed,did the battery usage summary not make it extremely obvious what was draining it
Android,not_removed,two days ago
Android,not_removed,not sure but thats not my case my phones good now after disabling all the vr apps and i didnt notice any battery drain coming from the app ill try to observe it though but im pretty sure it doesnt drain my battery
Android,not_removed,not my case either i get full day battery life and some more
Android,not_removed,you can limit the number but not what app and from what i can tell it just kills off older ones once it reaches the limit which sometimes arent what you want
Android,not_removed,im not really sure i was just pointing out that i had an exynos instead of a sd my girlfriend has a sd and it seems like the problem is worse on hers we both use fb messenger and snapchat and snapchat runs in the background and kills battery more often than mine same with fb messenger its usually on the bottom of my battery list at the end of the day and its usually at the top for her
Android,not_removed,i dont really get it because they can play music in the background and pretty much do whatever my phone can in the background if those are all just push notifications why doesnt android just do the same thing i dont see the benefit
Android,not_removed,facebook runs quick congratulations facebook devs my phone runs slow and the battery runs out quickly you suck appleandroidsamsung devs
Android,not_removed,thats specific to spotifys way of implementing it apps can download up to minutes in the background although i guess theres a good reason spotify did it the way they did
Android,not_removed,it just said android system was using of the battery life
Android,not_removed,hm someone had said something about it draining battery on xda so i got rid of it for awhile just redownloaded it so ill see how it is for my battery life im also on the so that might be why my battery sucks lol
Android,not_removed,it boggles my mind that there is no way to block apps from running in the background on android while ios has had it for years now
Android,not_removed,yes those are just push notifications the developer asks apple to show a notification via apms and ios handles showing the notification apps take action on that notification only when the user clicks it music is a similar story apps tell the os to play a music file or stream and os takes care of playback when the user clicks next song button for example os asks the app to wake up and tell it which song to play next it is like singing a song yourself versus requesting a song from a singer in android every push notification wakes your app and the app is responsible for showing the notification which enables custom icons counters pictures in notifications etcbut trades off battery lifebut recently android push system began to shift towards apples approach
Android,not_removed,apps can actually download indefinitely if they use the right api they can stay alive and do whatever they feel like for minutes but if they hand off a http download to a special api that exists for the purpose it can go on as long as they want
Android,not_removed,it takes me over an hour to download my full music collection and sometimes overnight to upload photos and videos i took during the day that ten minute limit would literally make basic things impossible for me
Android,not_removed,thats still a limit
Android,not_removed,never said it wasnt

Android,not_removed,i think competition is good and i would be happy to see the come to the states provided the price isnt terribly inflated seems to be the sweet spot for budget flagships also the price i would expect the lepro to cost if launched here and i am thinking that if more and more phone manufacturers release competitive devices in this range it will force either the big guys to innovate even further to justify price tags or lower their prices partnerships with the large telcos would be ideal so that the options through the carriers isnt just limited to premium iphone samsung lg phones and their options
Android,not_removed,they should name their phones other than le le le ugh
Android,not_removed,great news ever since i got my zte axon i think im done with premium flagships costing the midrange price point while having flagship specs is where its at these days and leeco has some pretty sweet phones in that range
Android,not_removed,the le cool dual was on my shortlist until i got the zuk cheap letv put out phones with great specs for the price but im not sure on cm support and prefer to have a headphone jack on my phones
Android,not_removed,if they release phone in us what skin will they use the china market skin or the new skin for us market
Android,not_removed,says on their site that the usb c port in their phones retires the headphone jack great
Android,not_removed,le epic xd
Android,not_removed,hopefully they release the le pro here of course its not going to be like it is in china but if it was it would be another great addition to the flagship line honor axon idol and oneplus
Android,not_removed,their names gotta be the worst names ever
Android,not_removed,does this mean cdma support
Android,not_removed,please come to verizon
Android,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt mind it costing dollars unlocked either
Android,not_removed,the phone made for rcirclejerk
Android,not_removed,they bought vizio right thats a pretty popular name here in the states
Android,not_removed,meme phones
Android,not_removed,le le leugh
Android,not_removed,maybe theyll be vizio branded
Android,not_removed,just gotta get a le car to go with your le phone
Android,not_removed,millions of chinese are named le
Android,not_removed,id never heard of the zuk let alone the how is it not more popular the specs seem top notch and it shipped with marshmallow hows the camera and screen
Android,not_removed,theyll probably use eui their main skin i wouldnt be too surprised if they pull a zte on us and use a more stock like skin zte uses an ios style skin in china similar to huaweis emui but in the us they use a more stock skin
Android,not_removed,lol no
Android,not_removed,til before reddit leeco was eco
Android,not_removed,yep
Android,not_removed,lesigh
Android,not_removed,but is it pronounced lee or leh or lay im so confused without an accent over the e
Android,not_removed,im not sure maybe lenovo havent marketed it that well with the moto lineup competing and other popular brands like xiaomi out there to be fair the camera is average at best and the screen could be a bit brighter but i cant complain for the price performance and battery
Android,not_removed,its a chinese phone just launched in india if you were watching the olympics in china a zuk ad came up pretty much every hour
Android,not_removed,lel no
Android,not_removed,a lot of their phones support cdma already i wouldnt be surprised if they also support sprint once they launch formally here and get on board with sprint
Android,not_removed,since its from china im going with lee as in bruce
Android,not_removed,so deluded
Android,not_removed,樂 thanks it sounds like luh to me
Android,not_removed,le and lee are completely different pronunciations depending on the language of origin
Android,not_removed,le can be lé lē lè or what you mean is the syllable lī
Android,not_removed,why
Android,not_removed,sorry redditz your submission has been removed rule no spam blogspam or rehosted content if you would like to appeal please my removed submissionmessageim writing to you about the following submission
Android,not_removed,or the inverse is true the vive is costing them money and theyre positioning the division for easy sale we wont know until their earnings report
Android,not_removed,lul headline is 🔥🔥🔥
Android,not_removed,the alphabet is your friend what frustrates me even more is an app titled one thing in the play store installs with a completely different name in the app drawer httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomlegostarwarsthenewyodachronicles its called lego star wars yoda ii in the app store you can search your apps under l section all you want youll never find it guess what its called when it installs tyc new the fuck
Android,not_removed,you know what really grinds my gears when an app gets updated and it moves from a specific nova drawer group i placed it in back into the main drawer
Android,not_removed,yeah but you could just put the apps you use frequently on one of the home screens that way theyll never move
Android,not_removed,nope
Android,not_removed,no because i am used to scrolling down in alphabetical order i use google now launcher
Android,not_removed,not really since i have my folders with gestures on my home screen and novas app search is a single swipe away i hardly ever open my app drawer probably partially the fault of having pages of apps
Android,not_removed,yes if youre using nova launcher you can ser up an app search gesture the menu show frequent recent and new apps or you can type the first letter and pick from the results
Android,not_removed,nope i just use search with nova shortcut to open it
Android,not_removed,if youre using google now launcher you can forget all these suggestions easiest way to avoid this hold the app drawer button down and it will automatically bring up app search when it opens the drawer
Android,not_removed,wow samsungs annoying feature is perfect for you it adds new installs to the end of your app list until you go in and rearrange them
Android,not_removed,no if you remember the name of your app and the alphabet youll be fine some launchers such as samsungs will let you change the order or just have new apps install at the end of the list
Android,not_removed,no i use pull down to search feature in nova frequent apps are on my homescreen
Android,not_removed,this is why i stay in alphabetical list view
Android,not_removed,no i like my app drawer in alphabetical order and homescreens as i arrange
Android,not_removed,action launchers app draw is alphabetical and its by far my favourite launcher
Android,not_removed,this bothered me a bit too so i finally made a folder on the home screen with frequently used apps in addition to the most frequently used in the bottom bar
Android,not_removed,start using httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidnamepilgrappdialer or httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidnetebtappswitch and change the way you launch apps scrolling though pages of apps is frustrating in general not just when things move
Android,not_removed,ofc but with nova app drawer options hide apps every app that i rarely use its hidden in my phone then with the search function or gesture you can search for it
Android,not_removed,i dont install apps frequently and dont use the app drawer regularly so no
Android,not_removed,httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidnamepilgrappdialer for a year now i dont even have an app drawer icon on my home screen i open appdialer with lmt launcher which means i can open any app from everywhere really cool feature is that the newly installed app is always the first icon in the app
Android,not_removed,i dont really use the lsumcher app drawer ever since i got httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidnetebtappswitch i can open it up on any screen
Android,not_removed,i think its worse when it pushes the last app to a new drawer page where it sits alone i cant stand that and have to uninstall some app or create a new folder so that the new drawer page with only one app is gone
Android,not_removed,not really
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,no because apps are in alphabetical order and if i download a new one i except it to be placed in its appropriate alphabetical location
Android,not_removed,not at all probably irritated at first but if there is anything to blame itll be myself for not using the tabs function on nova that is
Android,not_removed,yeah but also it searches through all the regular google search stuff i wanted a quick way to just search and find my apps
Android,not_removed,nope with smart launcher which automatically categorises all my apps so im not scrolling thru an endless list
Android,not_removed,no i use app search
Android,not_removed,app search or because i use nova i can have folders inside the app drawer and organize them that way in fact im gonna do that right now
Android,not_removed,i hate it when the icon disappears from home screen after updating
Android,not_removed,well on some devices depending on launcher the apps in application drawer are sorted by alphabet while on others are sorted by most recent so the recently added apps would all appear at the end together which then avoids the problem you mentioned
Android,not_removed,i normally just hit up the search bar in my app drawer partially because i hate the look of my app drawer and will get the urge to purge some shit i need for the sake of aesthetics ie having all the play apps in a row of or something if i scroll through it need tip if you use google now launcher long press the app drawer button to launch into search wish nova would implement this i miss it
Android,not_removed,no thats what the homescreen is for often used apps if you use apps so much that you know the position of them in the app drawer they belong on the homescreen
Android,not_removed,just go to play store settings and turn that option off adding apps to home screen
Android,not_removed,yep this is the major reason why i liked the launcher on xperia phones and the ios and miui home drawers i know there are third party launchers that can do this but itd be cool to have a sort by last installed on google now launcher or pixel launcher by default
Android,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomnpleiyopng my homescreen is icon free everything i need is on apps edge or a homescreen gesture away
Android,not_removed,no get that ios crap out of here if you want to find apps by position put them on your damn home screen complaints like this need to die before they kill the app drawer
Android,not_removed,no i use smart launcher
Android,not_removed,whats most frustrating is how easy it is to solve this problem aviate launcher used to have the most amazing app organization you had a section for each letter of the alphabet and a quick scroll tab on the right side of the screen simple intuitive quick
Android,not_removed,hitman sniper im eyeballing updownleftright near h apps but cant find it fer is listed as sniper and how can google not do random shit the play series of apps are listed as google play xyz in settings all apps section but show up as play xyz in drawer
Android,not_removed,ugh this i downloaded a podcast player called literally podcast player and guess what it got installed as player fmi mean wtf
Android,not_removed,chromecast google cast google home home
Android,not_removed,then theres zzsunset dead space
Android,not_removed,this bugs me too i have image app panasonic remote appmarantz connect motorola connected bmw connected bmw i messenger fb
Android,not_removed,yes i have so many various tv and movies apps that sometimes ill lose one from the folder and forget it exists
Android,not_removed,omg yes what makes it worse is it is not consistent i have some folders each having apps in them yea im a hoarder some apps get pushed back to main drawer after update while some dont i havent yet figured out which apps do that
Android,not_removed,welp thats added to the list of nova launcher bugs that will never be noticed under all the pointless praise this buggy launcher gets
Android,not_removed,what is this ios s
Android,not_removed,it really confuses me that people use the app drawer so much that it would be an issue surely thats just a huge waste of time
Android,not_removed,ive been using the app dialer widget havent accessed my app drawer in years
Android,not_removed,does this work for people one of my nits that annoys me more than it should about android is that occasionally when apps are updated my home screen shortcut for the app disappears then i need to try and remember which app was in that empty space to drag in back out again
Android,not_removed,how do you do the app search directly from the homepage really missing that feature from nova
Android,not_removed,hey how do you setup that white line in the dock ive been using nova for a real long time and i still dont know how to do it
Android,not_removed,what is the search bar you are using
Android,not_removed,ditto with novas app drawer style list
Android,not_removed,yeah i havent used my app drawer in years
Android,not_removed,you can also configure samsung to automatically alphabetize your app icons as new ones are added
Android,not_removed,isnt this common sense blows my mind anyone does do this especially with action launcher and hidden folders
Android,not_removed,he means the app drawer when an app is installed it goes to the drawer and slots into place alphabetically
Android,not_removed,well the app is like hitman stealthy i see no problem here
Android,not_removed,without making it shorter it would look something like google play x
Android,not_removed,i mean google does it itself google duo on the play store duo on your phone
Android,not_removed,used to shit me how theyd all be labelled as play xxx in the drawer then when youre looking for a widget itd be google play xxx to jump it up in order
Android,not_removed,dev here not of those apps but just in general for android the only time that happens when an icon just disappears from a home screen folder or wherever is when the apps starting page is a different one codewise technical they changed that apps launcher activity to a different one
Android,not_removed,oh im so glad im not alone
Android,not_removed,i figure its something in the app apps can declare multiple launchers so i figure its possible to update an existing one in a way that makes the home screen think its a new launcher of course this is detrimental for the app since it gets removed from your home screen but they do it anyway
Android,not_removed,what else is buggy
Android,not_removed,are you a salty dev of a competitive launcher or something
Android,not_removed,pointless praise buggy launcher 😓
Android,not_removed,something something i need my widgets
Android,not_removed,just use action launcher i have like apps on my home screen and it looks like i have its very minimalistic any other apps i just search the name for with a quick gesture i havent used the app drawer in months
Android,not_removed,not when you know where the app icon is and can quickly tap it some people prefer a clean home screen without icons only relevant widget information
Android,not_removed,you can set a gesture to open an app search on nova
Android,not_removed,nova gestures
Android,not_removed,long press the app drawer button
Android,not_removed,you press the google search button
Android,not_removed,settings desktop page indicator
Android,not_removed,its part of the nova launcher does that help
Android,not_removed,thats true but i use swipe on the google keyboard and swiping in the general direction is usually enough for the keyboard to figure out what im trying to type theres also a shortcut on the keyboard so you can easily switch from full to small keyboard mode
Android,not_removed,confirmed always starts with the same letter of the alphabet whereas in a grid it can be on the right left anywhere depending on app count on any given day considering location memory is how we navigate our phones this seems like a horrible methodology and one i havent used in years
Android,not_removed,silly me didnt even read it properly sorry
Android,not_removed,i understand that im just saying please dont complain about it the last thing i want is for this to be fixed
Android,not_removed,sounds like a salty wannabe dev to me
Android,not_removed,app search is good stuff one reason i actually like emui they copied spotlight search from ios
Android,not_removed,one other option is to use a scrolling dock if you have nova launcher i save my homescreens primarily for widgets so that feature is really useful
Android,not_removed,omg thank you it works so welk
Android,not_removed,lol thats google search he was using the app search feature from nova launcher i thought there was a shortcut built into pixel but guess not
Android,not_removed,hey thanks
Android,not_removed,are you using nova beta my app search looks different
Android,not_removed,google search does app search though for stuff installed on your phone
Android,not_removed,ah yes thats probably why

Android,not_removed,this post was already removed tho
Android,not_removed,the bot usually removes all self posts so that the mod team can go through it before approving it it needs to be confirmed by a human to see if it breaks the rules or not if it does then well have to remove it again to approve the bots action
Android,not_removed,oh ok thanks for clearing that up for me
Android,not_removed,post tagged as samsung mods are memers
Android,not_removed,i cant stop fanboying over this phone i dont want it i need it
Android,not_removed,genuine question here but whats the difference between this and the mi plus
Android,not_removed,wow thats a clean looking phone super appealing
Android,not_removed,sonote without the explosives
Android,not_removed,those micron camera pixels scare me with low light performance i know sony said that its comparable to larger pixel size sensors but physics be physics
Android,not_removed,this thing costs australian dollars on gearbest atleast how well does it stack up to other flagship phones
Android,not_removed,looks like a nice piece of hardware what are peoples thoughts on miui in terms of usability and support
Android,not_removed,any news about the release date of this phone in usa
Android,not_removed,looks freakin sexy would like to see some full reviews though
Android,not_removed,would this phone work on tmobile
Android,not_removed,really curious about this device was about to pull the trigger on an axon but i love that battery i dunno about waiting more months for it though and it will probably end up being about bucks or so
Android,not_removed,when i tried to look around and see how the mi performed there were quite a few complaints about things like wifi and software and build quality etc personally i see xiaomi as a brand to avoid zte or oneplus do better and actually provide a premium experience xiaomi havent shown any sign they properly care about the global market other than places like brazil and india
Android,not_removed,really hoping some people post close ups of the screen on release amoled is gonna have some potentially severe pentile artifacting that may be a deal breaker for me personally in my hands on with moto z play the had visible but not horrible fringing on text and the extra screen size will just make it worse
Android,not_removed,the app icons are ugh
Android,not_removed,so whats the biggest different between this and the mix
Android,not_removed,looks nice but a phone at this size without a pen and having curve display for no reason other than having one just doesnt feel very polished in design
Android,not_removed,i would buy this in a heart beat if it supported us lte bands
Android,not_removed,breaks my heart everytime i see a xiaomi phone on this sub knowing theres zero lte support here in the us breaks my heart i want a mi max so bad
Android,not_removed,talk about disappointing
Android,not_removed,actually this is the new samsung xiaomi mi note samsung decided to retire their galaxy brand after the note fiasco
Android,not_removed,after all this time how hard can it be to check the title for xiaomi before note isnt all you need to do is add another line to the flair system that flairs posts with xiaomi in the title as xiaomi with higher priority than note getting flaired as samsung
Android,not_removed,thats how i feel about the mix
Android,not_removed,• plus has a metal unibody design note has curved glass on the rear • plus has a camera note has a camera • plus has a smaller battery compared to the note battery
Android,not_removed,physical looks yes featuresui this phone is completely different
Android,not_removed,if only it had the spen
Android,not_removed,yeah me too i was surprised by their camera choice and the relative lack of attention given to the camera in the presentation id expected something with ois and bigger pixels the mi note was a great camera phone and i worry that the mi note just isnt going to hold up
Android,not_removed,give it some time after the official release on november and youll be able to purchase it at a more reasonable rate for example i purchased the redmi note pro when it was just released for canadian compared to now when i can get it for canadian original retail price of the device was about so you can really see the markups
Android,not_removed,the price will come down over a month or two when demand settles happens every time with xiaomi releases also btw gearbest isnt exactly the xiaomi reseller id recommended for australia people have had better luck with ibuygou and hk goldway ali express seller
Android,not_removed,features they are all there xiaomi likes to push updates and features through miui rather than android versions so you may get a good number of features while still being on or so on and so forth usability very good i had no complaints in my time using it though i did eventually switch to the interface is what android user wishes ios was miui extremely customizable in usage and looks the theme store is packed the the gills with stuff to choose from the ui although very different from stock android is consistent in looks and has a nice color palette it also has a lot of small convenient features which unlike samsungs seem to actually be useful i especially miss the messaging app support xiaomi gives updates lots of them you will get most features on time too however they will be pushed through miui rather than android versions xiaomi phones are easy to root dont lose warranty on rooting or unlocking and have a great developer community i was on stable marshmallow in march and am expecting stable nougat by year end on mu redmi note
Android,not_removed,i probably only buy it when theres successful ported version of cm having a redmi note pro and miui differences are day and night probably because i am used to the google stock interface
Android,not_removed,the notifications in miui are completely ruined you cant read message contents on the lock screen nor can you use notification actions or dismiss them
Android,not_removed,never
Android,not_removed,not gonna happen id estimate itll be at least another months to a year before they sell phones in the us importing is the only way or having someone go to china for you and buy it
Android,not_removed,its not coming to the us thats straight from hugo barra but you can import it since it does support all of the us lte bands
Android,not_removed,only reason they can sell inc china at all is chinese govt doesnt give a shit about intellectual property
Android,not_removed,i think it may not be pentile samsung isnt making it lg is i think they use rgb or rgbw cant remember stripe
Android,not_removed,miui has some awesome theming capabilities built in
Android,not_removed,mi note has full lte support in the us bands including tmobiles band i was at the event and this was a feature that hugo was very excited about
Android,not_removed,talk about being a whining brat
Android,not_removed,mi note mi mix and the for me
Android,not_removed,i frickin just placed an order for the mi mix im in love with that phone cant wait to get it
Android,not_removed,you should also mention its not a bad thing
Android,not_removed,camera quality
Android,not_removed,why do you say that ive had pretty good experiences buying xiaomi power banks and headphones from gearbest
Android,not_removed,still waiting for those worlds cs killed numbers still holding your beer
Android,not_removed,does miui have split screen
Android,not_removed,itll be a while longer theyll probably get sued right away with their current flagships launching in the us something like the mi mix would be a nice start
Android,not_removed,like full lte support theres nothing missing for it
Android,not_removed,are you sure it gets lte support heard that it only gets speeds att only gets from the phoned antennas here in the states
Android,not_removed,rgb pentile displays havent been used in a phone in a few years lg ended up licensing pentile because rgb layouts had so many drawbacks including short lifespan
Android,not_removed,but only the highend variant ram storage has global bands other variants are not worldwide ltecompatible
Android,not_removed,woosh
Android,not_removed,whoosh
Android,not_removed,whoosh
Android,not_removed,actually whoosh
Android,not_removed,the series looks seriously good imho
Android,not_removed,are you sure plus has it ifaik only has it
Android,not_removed,only the has the pressure sensitive display and the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner plus has a dual camera
Android,not_removed,oh its definitely not bad also you have a mi max how is it if i cant get my hands on a mi note im considering a mi max as my goto alternative ive always liked massive phones and dat battery sounds really really nice
Android,not_removed,with their phones they flash shitty vendor roms on them i think
Android,not_removed,yeah the task proved too big for me riot should let us know edit i was so confused because your comment kept taking me to an randroid thread stop estalking me
Android,not_removed,they claimed it would release with android n in xiaomi phones didnt have it in miui which i used
Android,not_removed,serious question why would they be sued
Android,not_removed,only the mi note does it has bands unlike other mi smartphones it works completely on both att and tmobile
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,even the high end variant is cheaper than similarly specd flagship phones
Android,not_removed,i love this phone as you said the battery life is incredible i like miui unlike so many others so ive had to make modifications got it for no contract exchanging my nearly four year old xperia z well worth it
Android,not_removed,i love this phone as you said the battery life is incredible i like miui unlike so many others so ive had to make modifications got it for no contract exchanging my nearly four year old xperia z well worth it
Android,not_removed,any timeline on when xiaomi mi will be updated to nougat thinking of buying one but not sure whether to straight up flash cyanogen mod or test out miui for a while
Android,not_removed,aside from obvious trademark issues id wager theres a good chance theyre infringing on us patents as well chinese companies have a history of not really caring about that sort of thing
Android,not_removed,looks like it wont support tmobiles volte but honestly im sure how useful that is
Android,not_removed,mi mix with there are only and options so was it a typo
Android,not_removed,i have not been following the development sorry though if you want lte bands in western countries the might pose a problem imo in its price bracket the beats the by a good margin
Android,not_removed,miui with nova launcher or google launcher is very good only thing that they carried over from and i dislike is the multitasking which has an horizontal layout instead of the vertical one of stock android which is much better imho since you finger moves more easily up to bottom then left to right apart from that it has some i especially like the cloned apps feature since it lets you have two accounts for many apps like whatsapp if you have two sims is really convenient
Android,not_removed,but the moto was fine after the lg
Android,not_removed,i dont think apple and samsung own patents to their naming scheme but if they do thats completely stupid because they effectively patented a sequence of letters and numbers
Android,not_removed,if you find yourself in an lteonly situation you wont be able to make or receive calls
Android,not_removed,ive seen for € while only at € so being that at the same price the two phones are pretty close at almost half the price
Android,not_removed,the bands are mostly fine for me because i live in australia one plus is a great phone but i want one inches or less ive tried larger but find it too inconvenient
Android,not_removed,it wouldnt be patented it would be trademarked tm
Android,not_removed,they probably have a trademark for the use of those names in relation to smartphones not just the numbers and words themselves
Android,not_removed,did some digging and looks like thats right with the caveat being only for band
Android,not_removed,oops my bad
Android,not_removed,it is still a great phone no question about it but i do not have the answers for your questions about how well this phone is supported
Android,not_removed,well technically it can happen on any band but youre right that its most likely to happen on band
Android,not_removed,android nougat w google assistant snapdragon adreno x ips display aspect ratio base storage w micro sd card slot of ram battery qi wireless charging us only dual camera portrait lens wide angle lens certified single bottom firing speaker usbc headphone jack no quad dac for us version glass back w metal frame finger print scanner is also a power button i think i got all of it
Android,not_removed,damn thats a pretty phone
Android,not_removed,dat intro music
Android,not_removed,no dbrand plug meh review
Android,not_removed,this phone is really good until you realise you live in europe so you wont get the quad dac or wireless charging the soc is going to be outdated by the time the phone actually launches the camera sensors are years old and the south korean price is so it will probably be similar globally i really really like the front design though the back glass design on the other hand can go suck it
Android,not_removed,that cheeky pewdiepie notification at
Android,not_removed,watching this on an lg lol
Android,not_removed,mkbhd is my favorite way to get a good look at how a phone looks he gets as much angles as possible and gives me a good insight at how nice or ugly a phone is
Android,not_removed,i still have my because im a poor and i want to buy my next phone outright that beautiful display is really giving me lifebut my wallet is on its deathbed 😩💦💦💦📱 ﻿（ｗａｔｅｒ－ｒｅｓｉｓｔａｎｔ）
Android,not_removed,for the love of god please get rid of the l preview soft buttons
Android,not_removed,but it lacks an ir blaster yes i want an ir blaster on a device that costs in korea according to sources
Android,not_removed,i still have my and was maybe looking into a but damn the looks nice i am not a smartphone enthusiast so i am going to have to compare the two since i dont know if i want to switch from lg
Android,not_removed,am i the only person in randroid who isnt a fan of how this phone looks im not sure what it is maybe the rounded screen corners
Android,not_removed,congrats lg you went from an obvious branded style to making a galaxy clone i really do think the was the best looking phone they put out
Android,not_removed,ughhhh so sexy really really like the look of it
Android,not_removed,i hope mkbhd is as critical about other phones this year as he is this one all this but its not perfect talk
Android,not_removed,year old sensor why
Android,not_removed,love the screen and design
Android,not_removed,interesting that it has the home animation like the pixel maybe its going to be like this for the and other devices when they get the assistant
Android,not_removed,aosp rom
Android,not_removed,should have been top
Android,not_removed,oh man that dbrand plug fakeout at had me chuckling for a moment
Android,not_removed,there are people that walk around with their phones without a case what
Android,not_removed,i was going to wait on this but after a bad with some sort of internal motherboard issue a with the bootloop issue i had my fill of lg my is still my emergency backup but i just had to get a pixel xl coming tomorrow lg always had me with the replaceable battery and the sd card slot i like having pictures i take and my play music library on the device but after this second issue with the hardware im out
Android,not_removed,how is this better than the no removable battery no hifi dac internationally
Android,not_removed,the real question is can you root and keep warranty to block all fcking annoying ads everywhere in youtube and google and apps smartphones have become mobile advertisement devices which has a phone build in﻿
Android,not_removed,my was life at one point now i have a edge but this bootloader is locked
Android,not_removed,why isnt no one talking about the rounded edges of the screen i find that pretty i found an app that can simulate that on my galaxy edge
Android,not_removed,looks good to me wow lots of negativity in here for a phone that hasnt even been released
Android,not_removed,looks nice but seems like last years tech like this should have been the
Android,not_removed,best thing about this phone is that its trying not to be an lg phone
Android,not_removed,ive never heard him say so many its not perfect in a review or hands on like he is trying so hard not to like itsmh its okay to like an lg phone if they knocked it out of the park typical googleapple fanboy
Android,not_removed,forgot bootloop
Android,not_removed,i feel like they should have just kept it and made the phone shorter the doesnt really offer many benefits in practice and i think being able to reach up the screen easier would be much more useful
Android,not_removed,gorilla glass though wtf
Android,not_removed,he didnt say anything about dbrand i expect it in the full review
Android,not_removed,i guess is the year of every smartphone company copying the iphone at this point just go with the iphone better performance and it actually looks like an iphone rather than a bad copy
Android,not_removed,unfortunately the hifi dac wont be included in the us version
Android,not_removed,usa only for wireless charging what a joke
Android,not_removed,in the lg page says that it also has a standard lipo battery dolby vision front camera back wide angle front camera headphone jack usb type c
Android,not_removed,no ir blaster is all i see
Android,not_removed,is it still using qualcomm quick charge or usb pd
Android,not_removed,the camera is also a sony which is rather old and questionable
Android,not_removed,grips why not on high end phone is so bottom chin is thicker than the top removed perfect symmetry other than that lg did a great jobs i wish there is more color to choose from
Android,not_removed,the quad dac and wireless charging being region locked totally kill this device for me since here in mexico well be getting neither way to go lg you finally release an excellent phone that ticks a ton of right boxes with very few compromises but i have to rule it out because one of its most attractive features isnt available on most variants i wonder if these features are going to be included in hardware but disabled based on firmware if that is the case it might be easy to get them working just by flashing a firmware from a different region like sonys fingerprint reader
Android,not_removed,i want it but at the same time ive been hurt before source my lg sitting in a drawer
Android,not_removed,every time i see a video about the phone its like i love looking at the screen but i remember the people who say they got bootlooped from lg phones i should just get the edge
Android,not_removed,a phone as beautiful as the mkbs production values tech porn
Android,not_removed,still cant believe lg didnt take advantage of like a for promo material
Android,not_removed,damn shame he ditched i love this song calling crows from alltta would be a pretty dope intro song
Android,not_removed,wait for the actual review high chance of being sponsored by dbrand
Android,not_removed,shit i didnt know i lived in europe
Android,not_removed,previous g phones fell in price crazy fast though still wont get one but if you wait a few months you should get your hands on it pretty cheaply
Android,not_removed,the camera sensors are years old eh photos taken by the phone look great though theyre up there with the at least so whatever software trickery lg did really made the sensors shine
Android,not_removed,heres the thing that bothers me why does it need sd unless you are playing some heavy mobile games i cant see you ever stressing it out now hopefully its priced accordingly because if its not then it will get slaughtered by the
Android,not_removed,hell yeah man fight the good fight hows your gps holding up 📱🛣🤷🏻‍♂️
Android,not_removed,﻿（ｗａｔｅｒ－ｒｅｓｉｓｔａｎｔ） this looks like a bon iver song title lol
Android,not_removed,the display sounds neat but i can imagine that many mediarich apps wont support it and videos will either be letterboxed or stretched lg has commissioned a few pretty videos on the format for marketing and im sure the camera will shoot the format but its not going to be widelyadopted i think vs is too much work for too little gain
Android,not_removed,same here years the still going strong the only thing is that my camera is broken i really wamt this one love my still
Android,not_removed,its poor me anyway i have decided not to buy new phone till my is dead
Android,not_removed,just get it man its gonna make you happy youll make more money
Android,not_removed,is the really an upgrade from the edge though i see nothing that really sets it apart
Android,not_removed,im still using my edge and cant see any major advantages to an upgrade yet aside from the beautiful bodytoscreen ratio of the it is so much more satisfying and frugal to upgrade every years its not like anything major changes in smartphones from year to year anymore
Android,not_removed,then buy a huawei mate or deal with the fact that extremely few people use this feature that no other flagship bothers to have it
Android,not_removed,as a long time user of the ir blaster in my phones im finally accepting its gonna go luckily the only thing left that cant be controlled through wifi are my amps but i guess one remote isnt so bad
Android,not_removed,my laptop cost and doesnt have an ir blaster arguing its expensive doesnt make sense just pick a different phone that does have a blaster
Android,not_removed,get the if you want a removable battery ir blaster and quad dac get the if you want water proofing wireless charging and a better quality wide angle camera
Android,not_removed,i dont like it either because of the following reasons its too damned thick and blocky with those chamfered edges the screens rounded corners have a noticeably different ratio vs the phones body it should at least be similar and finally the top and bottom bezels have different sizes which is a nono in terms of aesthetics and landscape mode use
Android,not_removed,seeing the reviews made me go look for an app to do this on my phone roundr is the one im using and it looks so nice
Android,not_removed,if this thing could be bought in a stock android version
Android,not_removed,honestly not sure my friend with a is happier with his purchase after seeing the
Android,not_removed,hopefully better display
Android,not_removed,it is not supposed to be a competitor or improvement it is a separate line like the s and the note series
Android,not_removed,at least we get fast wireless charging
Android,not_removed,man thats lame i wonder what the reason is
Android,not_removed,it wont be included in any version sold outside of korea and some asian countries they havent specified which ones
Android,not_removed,dac doesnt work with bluetooth anyways i liked my for it but now i have so dac dont matter
Android,not_removed,do we know if it will be in the canadian one i would imagine itll probably be the same as us
Android,not_removed,if like me you love in the uk this phone is pretty boring the screen is the only upgrade over a which the uk also didnt get im after a new phone this year and was in the runningthe processor doesnt bother me but after excluding features ill just wait to see samsungs offering or just buy a cheap
Android,not_removed,canada is also getting it
Android,not_removed,that just means you need to buy a charging sticker and somehow crack it open its likely compatible like the
Android,not_removed,i know some of these words
Android,not_removed,holy shit what the fuck lg who puts this in a phone is this with display out and stuff amazing
Android,not_removed,i assume is more scratch resistant and is more shatter resistant
Android,not_removed,yeah makes it a no go as an upgrade for my wifes
Android,not_removed,i cant believe they gave this up im holding on to my as long as possible hopefully until the where it returns because they realized they were pandering to non lg people and sold even less of these than the one can hope
Android,not_removed,i would presume that like the it supports both
Android,not_removed,where did you get that info from just wondering since i havent seen any specific mention of the sensor used anywhere
Android,not_removed,its larger so they can fit the lg logo there
Android,not_removed,a micro sd card is like
Android,not_removed,lg loves putting antennas near the bottom chin
Android,not_removed,curious that its my is
Android,not_removed,i dont know why your post reminded me but for the last years weve had this mysterious gadget called my crow is the card whatever that means
Android,not_removed,its really tempting but then i remember all the issues i had with my ive been hurt before too
Android,not_removed,primary reason why i need a new phone i was stupid enough to buy a nexus i have been looking at the but ill wait for reviews first the price seems to be high too maybe i should get a cheap phone and wait for the oneplus
Android,not_removed,my old one is in box under my desk
Android,not_removed,same here thats why i got an ill consider lg again in two years when im buying a new phone assume there are no more bootloops
Android,not_removed,i havent gotten an lg phone since the shine ive always said lg has one of the best phones in general but build qualitysoftware is kind of shitty
Android,not_removed,had my for years its starting to shit the bed right now wont attach to a computer but will still charge if i wiggle the usb around a little bit the usb port is just flat out broken ive ordered a shit phone from amazon to last me months until all the big hitters are out so i can pick up a new one then
Android,not_removed,my bootlooped days ago
Android,not_removed,why not wait for the next month
Android,not_removed,can confirmed got bootlooped its not the bootloops im worrying about though its the fact that i sent in my for repairs for the time for the same issue times total and that sbe lgs rma contractor in europe is shady and scammy af and wont give me back my phone until i pay up for an issue they should have fixed the last two times already
Android,not_removed,i only saw a lot of this with the is sound
Android,not_removed,if you look into it those happened with old processors that were being used the hasnt had those issues in a widespread manner like the older phones did i dont even think the had bootloop issues but i could be wrong about that
Android,not_removed,samsung amoleds have their fare share of problems pinkpurplegreen tint always on issuesactive display issues screen turns black after the hardware fried itself
Android,not_removed,lgs marketing department has no style
Android,not_removed,their ads for korea are good in case you liked the music
Android,not_removed,ahem
Android,not_removed,this was purely a reference to the phone being
Android,not_removed,he didnt really ditch hes just been switching it up recently i doubt hell use this more than once
Android,not_removed,doubt hell review it
Android,not_removed,the pictures look pretty to be honest certainly not at the level though will need more samples to verify regardless this is a flagship phone which will be priced like a flagship its not too much to ask for a sensor newer than years old its starting to feel like the only thing making this a flagship is the screen
Android,not_removed,i agree that i dont need an the is fine but if theyre charging for it i want the latest soc if i want the i can get that for less than
Android,not_removed,personally im more interested in the better battery life that theyre saying and also the better suited for eis for the camera as well while im sure they can make the battery life pretty good with a i can only imagine it should be better on the
Android,not_removed,its a fucking flagship phone that sort of mentality would be alright if it costed dollars maximum if you dont needwant the advantages of powerful soc why the fuck would you look at this in the first place how will the phone behave in years will it get android or or will it get cutout because the soc is old and theres no drivers will it shit itself on high resolution high framerate videos like all qualcomm based devices will it contribute for android to have less demanding apps and games audio video etc than ios devices and this is ignoring that a fucking dollar phone should get all sorts of support and full functionality during five years or more seriously what an apologistbased mentality the is a piece of garbage today compared with what you can get in devices that came last year how the fuck will it compare this year
Android,not_removed,futureproofing the same thing could have been said about the sd and some years ago but right now devices are still holding up while its safe to say that is outdated
Android,not_removed,heh it can be a little erratic but its still kicking im on the phone too not talking just use in general due to the nature of my work surprisingly everything is still going strong albeit i am noticing the battery slowly getting weaker
Android,not_removed,youve just made me realise that bon iver song titles are just a fixedwidth font removed from being vaporwave song titles
Android,not_removed,but imagine browsing the internet though my pc has a monitor so im used to slight letterboxing at this point weve already seen the playing video and i can live with this not giving up and seems right up my alley it might not be the best for video but it seems pretty damn good for everything else
Android,not_removed,my mom recently retired her lg rumour is a picture of the beast for reference of years at my suggestion and she got a new smartphone nothing special just something the carrier had on promotion now im just thinking to myself how i could have just given her my phone as a handmedown to justify blowing all that cash on a new phone i still have other relatives i could pawn this thing off on realistically ill probably just wait long enough until the already out to buy this im never going to be those people with a phone in its current release year 😪 i got my when the came out that long screen though😍
Android,not_removed,bigger screen on a similar sized body
Android,not_removed,back in the days it was there on flagships amazing feature imo
Android,not_removed,would you aim your laptop at your tv to control it this is a phone it looks and feels similar to a remote control
Android,not_removed,i dont know why people look over the when shopping for the its the same exact phone but smaller
Android,not_removed,ill switch with you id prefer wireless over dac but im outside the us
Android,not_removed,they had to stuff more antennas in there for the us variant
Android,not_removed,i manage to keep my phone dry but the is not waterproof at all has display hdr capability and the screentobody ratio increased greater than the by which was known for small bezels
Android,not_removed,anandtech mentioned it
Android,not_removed,lol
Android,not_removed,and im pretty sure it goes up to of expandable storage
Android,not_removed,yet i can use the same argument that it cost manufacture next to nothing to offer a memory instead off a memory that is so years ago years old lg has memory as does the years old samsung note this is should be the minimum for high end phone that cost
Android,not_removed,and microsd performs like shit compared to ufs so no justification my friend
Android,not_removed,had the and with no issues so this is really tempting me right now
Android,not_removed,had the yea
Android,not_removed,whats wrong with the
Android,not_removed,id suggest to get a moto plus and then get the or whatever theyll name it when it comes out ive had my plus for abiht a month and dont have a single complaint
Android,not_removed,with rumors of that phone being from to i use my phone but i dont use it that much to spend that kind of money i was actually planning to get the mate due to it being similar in size to the note but the lg just looks so nice
Android,not_removed,i honestly think the looks better than the based on leaks
Android,not_removed,my runs fine but the battery life is shit still prefer my note as an everyday driver
Android,not_removed,lgs marketing department has no grace
Android,not_removed,that was a pretty slick ad
Android,not_removed,they need to localize this ad for the us market i think its one of their best ads
Android,not_removed,at does he say amoleds over or im losing my mind
Android,not_removed,definitely fan edited it ends abruptly instead of having the lg chime
Android,not_removed,yep
Android,not_removed,in the last minute he talks about what hell cover in the full review
Android,not_removed,phonearena has more samples looks great to me not terrible and yes they couldve done better
Android,not_removed,me too that and if they can fix the bootloadergps issues they had with previous phones otherwise this phone is looking perfect to me in every way
Android,not_removed,especially since you can downclock the to ipc levels for efficiency
Android,not_removed,yup qualcomm is claiming the is up to more efficient than the so even if the actual figure is half of that its still a massive difference the is a soc really doubt any chip will be able to compare to it when it comes to battery life
Android,not_removed,calm down buddy my moto pure works perfectly fine and it never had the phone also if you read my post i said it skills be priced accordingly there is also a lot more to phones then just the spec that is the best looking phone ive seen along with being waterproof and expandable storage
Android,not_removed,will it shit itself on high resolution high framerate videos like all qualcomm based devices i meanit still will
Android,not_removed,the lyrics in almost every song dont make any sense but most of them just sound so right
Android,not_removed,is like the opposite of so if you like you may not like
Android,not_removed,the is still a good phone though expandable storage removable back cover thin bezels im keeping mine until it dies or becomes obsolete
Android,not_removed,hey i had that phone
Android,not_removed,is hardly worth upgrading
Android,not_removed,both amazing and of little use
Android,not_removed,op wasnt arguing the size he was arguing the cost
Android,not_removed,nah i prefer the dac also not a fan of lgs skin although its gotten better and i prefer metal phones for look feel and durability ill probably be getting the htc once the price drops a bit more plus uhoh protection is dope and means i can rock my phone caseless without worrying also dont have to worry about fucking up or voiding the warranty if i decide to root it it would almost be a crime to cover up a beautiful phone like the or the with a cheap plastic otterbox
Android,not_removed,ah i got ya makes sense
Android,not_removed,tbf idk if these bezels actually are smaller even though the sb ration is take the ipad pro for instance screen to body however it has huge bezels as a tablet should imo screenbody ratio is easier to look impressive on a larger screen vs the not saying you arent right just that screenbody ratio isnt the best indicator of bezel size
Android,not_removed,had the and now i love the wide angle lense on the so the fact theyve used the same sensor in both cams is probably gonna get me to buy it
Android,not_removed,still rocking my and still love it this is extremely tempting me
Android,not_removed,yeah my used was very good to me till my current which bootlooped months in my replacement has been good since august
Android,not_removed,it bootloops
Android,not_removed,lg made it so it has common lg problems like bootloop
Android,not_removed,nahh those rumours are from different areas of the globe using straight conversion which doesnt work and ignoring local taxes etc etc its never going to be that expensive that said i prefer the lg for now
Android,not_removed,you could wait and the price of the edge should drop
Android,not_removed,currently in the process of moving from a year old note to a oneplus i decided it was the only phone worth going to due to the how cheap it was for all the features and custom rom support custom roms are the only reason i was able to keep a hold of my note so long so hopefully the would last longer
Android,not_removed,in that case just wait until the comes out and the edge will plummet in price
Android,not_removed,really i thought samsung nailed it with the partial curved display also the way the the frames rounded corners complement the curved corners of the screen is really good looking imo whole thing just screams future to me i might be a little biased though given my phone history
Android,not_removed,completely agree i actually think the is quite ugly though i know im in the minority for that
Android,not_removed,the looks better than the hear hear
Android,not_removed,this has a funny face
Android,not_removed,he didnt review the but thats because it was a let down
Android,not_removed,so yeah pretty average generally not as good as the and iphone and a bit better than the the lost in scores they gave so i dont know how they can even put it that close to the others frankly not good enough for a flagship device launching at
Android,not_removed,i got accustomed to the letterboxing i think i can live with pillarboxing the trade off is getting more vertical reading room on both types of displays my monitor is in a landscape orientation and i hold my phone vertically when im scrolling through an articlepage its a vertical gain in both regards plus even horizontally apps do adapt its shown off more in from erica griffin who does say that some apps behave weirdly but i can see that being looked after by the devs
Android,not_removed,yeah i actually cant complain its been more than reliable right from the day i first got it and the removable back cover is a plus which is leaving the unfortunately though i guess that makes sense with the water resistance thing im just really in love with the thought of a taller screen
Android,not_removed,i just picked up a for a steal of a price im actually really impressed been a great phone for the days ive had it
Android,not_removed,especially when you consider its a lower overall area
Android,not_removed,well its different for everyone i guess but its not a bad feature to have everyone has a tv at home and having a remote in your phone was a quality of life improvement
Android,not_removed,but laptops and phones have similar costs
Android,not_removed,why not
Android,not_removed,thats what people used to say about computers too but here we are
Android,not_removed,except the primary camera sensor is now a lot worse than the so i dont see this as a good thing
Android,not_removed,same here and i was looking forward to the but no ir blaster no purchase
Android,not_removed,is this such a widespread problem this is the first time i hear about it
Android,not_removed,the is at tmo or it was last week anyway
Android,not_removed,i like the more understated approach of like youll always underestimate this phone until the screen lights up and that cranks up the wow factor imo edge screen lost the wow factor on me by now
Android,not_removed,i personally hate the curved edges on the screens of samsung phones so thats an instant demerit for me on its looks
Android,not_removed,i know im in the minority for that and i can personally confirm that you aint alone the damn thing gonna be more expensive too to ridiculous proportions i am really hopeful that samsung idiots bring a compact device and that becomes a major seller for the line up
Android,not_removed,from the leaks i think it is ugly as well much prefer the looks of the flat im using now
Android,not_removed,the awkward position of the fingerprint sensor is what kills the for me how hard is it to place it below the camera in the middle
Android,not_removed,you must have a real high bar then for my untrained nonphotographer eyes they look onpar
Android,not_removed,pillar boxing will look pretty weird at night with that lcd though
Android,not_removed,with cec integrated in most recent hardwares having a remote on your phone is just another option
Android,not_removed,yeah here we are everyone is using the cloud instead and getting shipped ssds
Android,not_removed,its not really a lot worse is it
Android,not_removed,i thought id be annoyed but im not really i only ever use it to turn the tv off or down when i cant find the remote and to troll
Android,not_removed,doesnt affect everybody but every other post on is bootloop troubleshooting
Android,not_removed,i can see that the is a pretty good looking phone especially in black i hope the edge isnt as extreme as it was on the edge subtle curve makes the bezels look smaller
Android,not_removed,youll always underestimate this phone until the screen lights up and that cranks up the wow factor hear hear again
Android,not_removed,theres clearly a reason they put it there dont assume you know everything
Android,not_removed,yeah i use sync the reddit client on its amoled night mode on my while it still looks pretty the bright black at night is noticeable and now considering pillarboxing on a video that just adds another level of distraction im willing to forego that mostly because i readtextbrowse the internet more than i am watching video i most likely wont even fork over a single dollar towards a new phone for a while so fingers crossed highres amoled displays get cheaper soon and the aspect ratio gains traction when im ready to cross that bridge
Android,not_removed,having recently done a home theater upgrade most new equipment uses bluetooth universal remote on phone was no problem and was a better experience than ir ir comes into play on anything older and when you wanna hijack tvs
Android,not_removed,you cant buy them yet but you will be able to soon and iono my music library is a few hundred gigs i travel a lot and it sucks looking for a song only to realize i dont have it downloaded i can no longer hold my entire photo library on my phone as every picture i take is up to not to mention videos are fucking massive on top of all that im completely ignoring the fact that my movie library is around plus didnt netflix just start allowing offline mode how large are those files either way right this instant i could fill up a sd card but it would be silly in a year or two though might just make a lot of sense
Android,not_removed,i have my one almost full a shit ton of hd showsmovies some video and some flac audio files will fill it up quick
Android,not_removed,oh i better let asus know they shipped me a hdd they must have made a mistake
Android,not_removed,the had a sensor for its camera the went smaller to a sensor same sensor as the oneplus because lg needed to add pdaf to compete with other oems now the is using a sensor even smaller yet again and its years old so they could get rid of the camera bump at the very least the sharpness advantage that lg held over other phones is now gone and i doubt their photo processing is up to google and apple levels so i expect it to honestly perform worse than the just as the performs worse as rated by dxo
Android,not_removed,glad i didnt switch to the from my then
Android,not_removed,itll probably be like the note edge
Android,not_removed,yeah buying a hdd in was your first clue
Android,not_removed,bootloops too not as often ive heard since the problem is just the power button getting stuck down where in the its a soldering issue
Android,not_removed,well see i always thought the s series caters to casuals and the note series caters more to productivity so i can see them keeping the edge very pronounced on the s series since it has more of a wow factor a more subtle edge like the nots is definitely more practical but doesnt look as flashy
Android,not_removed,ive never had that happen in three years of owning one thankfully
Android,not_removed,i feel like theyd make it less serious in general just to help comfort on the s line but ya never know
Android,not_removed,ive never had big issues with it if you dislike using it inbrowser id say measure the general amount of time your battery lasts as of now reinstall fb use it for a while and measure again if theres no discernible difference and no ram issues might as well just use it after all and swipe for fb is always an option if youre okay with web wrappers
Android,not_removed,facebook has never really drained as much battery as the people here claim install it and dont worry about battery drain
Android,not_removed,people have said it causes battery drain but there are many facebook alternatives that are much more battery friendly like swipe for facebook or foil for facebook
Android,not_removed,not a resource hog at all never has been doesnt show up in battery statistics as a significant app neither the main app or messenger
Android,not_removed,while i love swipe and yes its a fantastic app the search has been broken for quite some time now and that made me reinstall the official app just the other day and wow what a difference there are some very noticeable improvements throughout it feels very fluid with some nice animations doesnt heat up your device or hog the ram anymore and i never felt the disgust of old days while using it so here some anecdotal evidence that it actually got better
Android,not_removed,what makes swipe great
Android,not_removed,holy shit man you are comparing in the vs in the pixel that means the is getting twice the amount of light per frame than the pixel xl and the difference is further amplified by compression of a noisier image double the iso which depending on the amount of light might imply lots of more noise and it is further amplified by the fact usually get lower bitrate per frame than silly silly silly comparison just record the same video in both and lets have a look at the difference then edit thanks for the update somehow the is underexposing everything now compared to the pxl
Android,not_removed,you cant really compare to footage since the latter only lets half the light in and thus having to use a higher iso which results in more noise and less detail on the other hand i do agree with everything else — i also noticed the pixel favored aggressive denoising instead of just leaving some of the noisedetail intact compared to the coupled with the somewhat low recording bitrate the smeared image is greatly amplified
Android,not_removed,i saw your earlier post questioning whether your phone is defective and did some of my own research a few of my thoughts shooting outside in daylight there is definitely a difference with and in terms of sharpness fps being the sharper version i havent had a phone with fps support so im not sure what the proper expectations are for vs fps sharpness i do have access to a friends galaxy and iphone and i might try comparing but notably gsmarenas recent review picked this difference up and didnt find it noteworthy videos on the other hand get an unusually high bit rate with the de facto standard the output is similarly good the overall look and feel is the same minus the fine detail the videos are obviously smoother but not as detailed as the a rather common tradeoff source this would explain the difference in sharpness youre seeing between the nexus and pixel since youre shooting in fps on the and fps on the pixel version some recommendations as a result you should run a test across the relevant different pixel video modes as well as the nexus since comparion between the pixel and nexus is the correct apples to apples approach taking a screenshot of the video playing is unfortunately not a great way of testing sharpness since assuming youre playing on a display youre basically testing the resize algorithm of the video player either way it does show that the lenssensor is capable of capturing additional detail though it may depend on the software and shooting conditions i suspect that when compariing the results of the pixel and nexus well see that they are more comparable my own eyeball review of comparing the nexus and pixel reveals this but i didnt have a chance to screenshot but im interested to see what results you get
Android,not_removed,looks like things got overly compressed since the footage looks fine the footage and footage should also be fine if google enabled a higher bitrate could you post the bitrate for each version tbh it looks like shitty compression if nothing else the sensor does a mighty fine job at
Android,not_removed,and the circle jerk continues holy hell we get it the pixel isnt perfect i agree i think peoples money would be better spent on a oneplus but this subreddit has devolved into nothing but pixel bashers fighting with pixel enthusiast can we get back to the majority of the post here about being more than just the pixel people can siren their money on what they want and they dont have to justify it to anyone here
Android,not_removed,well there goes some of my pixel hype
Android,not_removed,my order just started processing hype for pixel xl slowly fading my reason to buy the pixel is the camera hey op we have the same shelf from ikea d
Android,not_removed,this sub goes into melt down once a negative opinion of the pixel is voiced wow
Android,not_removed,your test is super interesting to me because in the activity space in new york we literally have a room where consumers can test out the camera in lowlight the room is entirely lit by led tendrils coming from the the ceiling at a little above moodlighting intensity and all of those pictures have honestly come out excellent as far as ive seen i was hired for my vr experience so i havent rotated to that area yet but i did man the charging closet recently like a whole room dedicated to highlighting how well the camera does in lowlight none of my coworkers were hired for their photography expertise so im confused as to how you conducted this test to create this result
Android,not_removed,completely off topic question how do you like that futon i cant decide between that model futon or just spending the extra cash for a pull out couch for my living room btw
Android,not_removed,i have the exact same problem as you my nexus actually looks better doing than my pixel doing indoors ive had less than stellar low light performance all around
Android,not_removed,rgooglepixel just go there and see how many users are happy with their phone be it camera display or battery many have switched from iphone or note and they say this is by far the best phone they have used some people are just never satisfied
Android,not_removed,no youre wrong the pixel is perfect youre just nitpicking and trying to hate it
Android,not_removed,well that is very unfortunate hopefully it can be fixed in software because theres starting to be a pattern by google not doing enough polish for this flagship be it battery performance screen ram management or camera the pixel isnt the best at anything edit just look at pixel again leading the class good thing and its inferior dash wasnt there to get beaten by th emighty perfect pixel thats why you pay twice the money for er twice the results edit lol i knew you insane pixel fanboys would downvote me to shit youre worse than iphone fanboys at this point
Android,not_removed,just updated the op
Android,not_removed,yeah but pixel has the best camera on any phone and would be able to handle it s
Android,not_removed,just updated the op
Android,not_removed,just updated the op
Android,not_removed,welcome to the iphone mentality since everyone is stupid this phone is perfect
Android,not_removed,this sub reddit should rename its self to pixel holy fuck you cant even discuss the pixels negative points without the brigadiers in force
Android,not_removed,relax buddy this isnt nitpicking have you seen the videos a year old phone should not beat a newly released flagship at anything
Android,not_removed,it shouldnt this is a really poorly done test and videos shouldnt be compared
Android,not_removed,the camera is still hype as fuck tho
Android,not_removed,i dont know what you expect to get out of a camera in low light situations you need a steady hand out a tripod to get any real detail out of a camera that costs twice as much as the pixel in the same situation dont let op get you down the camera in normal to low light is outstanding and very little is able to help any camera record anything in low light
Android,not_removed,just updated the op
Android,not_removed,it goes into meltdown if either a negative or a positive opinion of the pixel is voiced its best if you didnt have any opinion on the pixel
Android,not_removed,taking a photo is very different from taking a still from a video thats why hdr was used in the frist place – it postprocesses several images together to get higher quality results this can obviously not be done when doing a video
Android,not_removed,well i have no issues with taking pictures the pictures from this phone are just down right amazing plus theyre taken instantly with hdr thats a first for me but as far as specifics i mean i didnt take any measurements of lighting or anything like that i just went into my computer room and took a video
Android,not_removed,its ok i guess its not the most comfy thing ive ever sat on though ive taken a couple short naps on it successfully at least so that counts for something the cats we have get more use out of it than us honestly
Android,not_removed,their minds are conditioned and its understandable after spending
Android,not_removed,thats a really great sample like going to the party conference and asking if they think the leader is doing a good job
Android,not_removed,here comes the xiaomi fanboy again take that pixel down a notch dude how dare they like a phones that isnt the same as yours wheres your partner in crime hctech
Android,not_removed,no youre wrong the pixel is perfect youre just nitpicking and trying to hate it please feel free to agree or disagree with the value proposition and merits of the pixel and contribute to thoughtful discussion however shitposts like these do nothing to further legitimate debate and instead represent the dregs of mindless tribalism and fanboyism you should be ashamed
Android,not_removed,you need this friendo s
Android,not_removed,i dont have issues with any of these things so far the pixel is better than my and in every which way
Android,not_removed,it arguably does have the best camera even the verge thought so who previously admitted the was better than the iphones
Android,not_removed,idk what articles youre reading but the pixel is getting praise for pretty much everything you mentioned for being the best in class
Android,not_removed,agreed its also thicker than a nexus for not noticeable additional battery
Android,not_removed,as someone who writes a lot of test protocols test method is very important i dont want to just pick a test apart just to prove someone wrong but if youre benchmarking the wrong way you could be skewing the tests unintentionally
Android,not_removed,just updated the op
Android,not_removed,you took a lot of critiques for your post some fair others a bit unfair but i just wanted to mention that i respect that you took it all in stride and revisited the question with a second try we need more of that around here kudos
Android,not_removed,theyre comparing to its not even a fair comparison
Android,not_removed,wont knock it til i try it i seen too many positives than negatives so thats good but some of these negatives are concerning maybe i have steadier hands than op
Android,not_removed,no doubt but im pretty sure i had shot clearer videos with my nexus by default with my nexus i use resolution always maybe when i get mine thered be some software update to help this
Android,not_removed,if someone spent that much money and got a phone that didnt perform well theyd be pissed and return it pretty simple really
Android,not_removed,was that analogy meant to be recognisable
Android,not_removed,is joke friend
Android,not_removed,ive done exactly that many times getting replies similar or identical to the comment youre replying to its clear that you dont like it when someone points out how pixel fans handle criticism of their phone but thats not my problem and neither am i ashamed at all
Android,not_removed,obvious sarcasm is obvious id hope i dont need it
Android,not_removed,his statement still applies its not best at anything except updates
Android,not_removed,arguably so it doesnt then ok thanks
Android,not_removed,lolno the battery life is worse than the the thermal throttling is on par and in some cases worse than a oneplus the display throne still belongs to the performence is not really a competition exynos wins again how on earth can you people keep defending this phone i thought randroid was above this apple level of fanboysim
Android,not_removed,battery life is much better than the i swear you people care more about numbers than actual real life performance
Android,not_removed,its only thicker at the top of the phone though
Android,not_removed,battery life is stellar by all people using both pixel
Android,not_removed,the battery is lager by and the is better at sipping battery than the
Android,not_removed,come on man if youre making good quality contributions and are getting shitpost replies then the answer isnt stooping down to their level conversations about the subreddit meta about which is worst the pro pixel circlejerk or the anti pixel circlejerk is all terrible and it does not add anything useful here if there are problems with the pixel whether you are pro or anti why cant we work together to uncover the truth about those issues or benefits rather than jumping to conclusions and pointing fingers i own a pixel and i like it as a phone but im more than happy to critically engage on it and thats proven by my willingness to examine its video quality and its storage speeds where i worked with the androbench devs to help get it running on the pixel so we could get a better story around it
Android,not_removed,yall trying so hard to hate the pixel smh
Android,not_removed,my battery life beats the fuck out of my friends iphone and my no slowdowns at all camera is easily the best one ive ever had though i hate that using it at maximum megapixels takes the picture only in want my widescreen pics back it really is a damn good phone and i was priestess to send it back if i wasnt blown away by it im decidedly keeping this bad boy
Android,not_removed,open a dictionary it might help
Android,not_removed,uh which review have you read most review seems indicate that battery life is on par or slightly better for pixel for camera quality its pretty subjective though
Android,not_removed,because its a really fucking good phone you mong probably the best ive ever owned and ive had a new phone each year since the came out
Android,not_removed,much better than a phone with terrible battery life doesnt mean much
Android,not_removed,so theres no phone out there with better battery life how sure are you about that
Android,not_removed,well thats a blanket statement if ive seen one there are reports of poor battery in rgooglepixel and a minority of reviewers have not been impressed with the battery though anything would seem stellar to someone still using a nexus its hilarious that a lot of the people commenting on how amazing the pixel is would never actually own one
Android,not_removed,yeah we are taking about better here nothing to brag about for
Android,not_removed,looks like you need yours cause thats not what it originally said its been edited since
Android,not_removed,oh come on i was making a joke about what the comments will probably be like and guess what there actually are comments like that below so that point stands and in this case i neither criticised nor praised the pixel but it seems that the pixel circlejerk absolutely cant be pleased not talking about you but this community and how toxic and mindless its become its true that there are both positive and negative sides but the positive side is overwhelmingly bigger and a big part of them are straight up diehard fanboys of their phone so what ends up happening is that nobody can say anything about the thing without expecting a rain of downvotes unless he praises it and says its the best phone evar the antipixel crowd while it exists is a lot more tame and a lot smaller than the rabid fanboy crowd where i worked with the androbench devs to help get it running on the pixel so we could get a better story around it actually thats pretty interesting didnt know about that good job
Android,not_removed,stating facts and not circle jerking hate
Android,not_removed,do you remeber the good old days in rrandroid when we used to hold manufacturers to some standard and we expected them to deliver at their respective price point well the pixel doesnt match its price and here we are defending the pixel to its grave why idk
Android,not_removed,easy there you dont want the haters come shouting cognitive bias
Android,not_removed,its close to the snapdragon not the exynos
Android,not_removed,ok its good i never said it isnt but why would you defend google when all they did was make a phone that was just good overall no best at anything and asking the same price as a iphone which is insane
Android,not_removed,and there are reports of bad battery life on the iphone on rapple doesnt mean theres an issue overall rather than on a few devices i actually have a pixel xl and the battery life is fantastic on it
Android,not_removed,where did you get those numbers the numbers ive seen are above the better area
Android,not_removed,the rabid fanboy crowd hahahahaha dude you are the rabid fanboy crowd the only difference is youre a xiaomi fanboy all of your comments are either defending xiaomi and arguing why theyre the best or trashing everything else talk about irony
Android,not_removed,how is not best at anything except update a fact
Android,not_removed,heres a shocker for ya sit down its a dousy some people disagree with your premise
Android,not_removed,im not disagreeing with you he said battery life is stellar by all people using both pixel
Android,not_removed,it doesnt but it also doesnt mean that that the pixel sub is representative of pixel owners as a whole that persons response suggested everyones battery life is stellar
Android,not_removed,i get about hours sot with my nexus thats about what people get with their pixel and thats with a brand new battery for them
Android,not_removed,what irony i can sense how triggered you are just by reading this comment and the other one the difference between me a supposed fanboy and randroid as of late is that i can admit valid criticism of the company that im a supposed fanboy of if i were a xiaomi fanboy why would i be running aosp instead of miui and i dont downvote others when they disagree with me you will very rarely hear me say that a xiaomi phone is being nitpicked and that people are merely trying to hate it and you will always see me either respectfully stating my opinion which will sometimes be negative or stating facts complemented by evidence if thats a fanboy everyone on earth is a fanboy well every second person the rest are fangirls
Android,not_removed,iphone is faster has a better screen wins no awards for price has better battery htc a better headphone out where is it best outside of updates
Android,not_removed,for the most part they are stellar some people will have issues sure but the same can be said for anything as long as the device is functioning properly battery life is amazing if you buy a car and it has something wrong with it it doesnt mean that that model car has a problem just the specific one
Android,not_removed,you cant really compare one persons battery life to another persons theres a lot of variables for example droidlife bloggers usually get terrible battery life on their phones compared to me but its always consistently terrible maybe you would get an extra hour of battery life under the same conditions with the pixel ive seen youtube loop video on wifi only till phone dies test and the pixels did about hours where one year old nexus did about probably new and if i remember correctly the compared to tests were about the same give or take a few minutes
Android,not_removed,so the pixel vs phones
Android,not_removed,compare any one phone against every other phone and its gonna lose most of its battles
Android,not_removed,sorry i forgot were only allowed to go into threads to say nice things
Android,not_removed,not seeing where ive disrespected anyone with anything ive said i dont care if someones feelings were hurt because i said something mean abour their phone
Android,not_removed,fixed the asinine double name in notifications that got introduced in the last version
Android,not_removed,gif keyboard support in nougat is nice
Android,not_removed,new feature you still cant delete single messages
Android,not_removed,bug fixes or performance improvements inquiring minds want to know
Android,not_removed,wait wait wait let me guess changelog made app icon slightly greener changed it back again to less green made chats less stable by blocking network access at random intervals fixed a bug where the app opened quickly now opening seconds slower as intended
Android,not_removed,hangouts allo duo messenger spaces opens whatsapp
Android,not_removed,when i search for a contact to send an sms to the search either takes minutes or cant be found is that fixed
Android,not_removed,waiting for the return of merged conversations
Android,not_removed,after what they did to the desktop chrome version im terrified of updates to hangouts
Android,not_removed,what features have they removed this time
Android,not_removed,more stickers
Android,not_removed,can they fix the google voice integration voicemails to my google voice number dont check my phones contacts to match a name to the number i cant seem to get voicemails to play back i have to keep hitting play over and over again it fails over and over again until it finally works seriously google i love google voice but its almost as if youre just killing that product through neglect lately wtf
Android,not_removed,is this the right dpi for stock pixel xl thanks
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,the gif keyboard is part of the enterprise shift for hangouts
Android,not_removed,rocking last version before the nerf im not upgrading to have less features
Android,not_removed,wow finally sms fallback integration just kidding
Android,not_removed,they removed the coloration from the overview screen as well it seems
Android,not_removed,i have one friend who actively messages me on whatsapp i dont understand how people can use it considering its only able to be used one one device with hangouts google voice i can get hangouts messages and texts sent to all my devices whenever that friend texts me i sometimes miss it because i was on my tablet vs the phone its super annoying i have the same issue with signal as well and i have one friend who insists on using signal hangouts may have its flaws but it still is the best option as long as google voice exists
Android,not_removed,long live hangouts
Android,not_removed,ok im stupid apparently it wont install am i doing something wrong
Android,not_removed,what are they doing with all these major version updates
Android,not_removed,to anyone still reading this thread dont update to this god awful hangouts release ever since they went past version it has been slow awful and full of bugs not even mentioning the removal of features i am blessed to have a jailbroken iphone and was able to go back to guess what smooth as butter multiple accounts with hundreads of messages it doesnt miss a beat i use hangouts every day for work and its just sad what these later updates have done to the app
Android,not_removed,when the hell are they going to fix web based contact pictures for sms been almost months since the latest break
Android,not_removed,actual change group chats now have the contact image for group chats again previously they all had one big photo its something a fix for a regression woohoo
Android,not_removed,its sad that people cant be bothered to long form rant in posts like these anymore
Android,not_removed,yes adding awesome features to hangouts will totally get everyone to switch to allo
Android,not_removed,slow as shit download
Android,not_removed,wait i thought theyre discontinuing hangouts in favor for allo
Android,not_removed,gosh that annoyed me to no end
Android,not_removed,i havent had chathead icons for half my contacts since or anyone know if thats a bug or something on my end i feel like people would be complaining more if it wasnt just me
Android,not_removed,i thought that was just me and spent a few days trying to fix it
Android,not_removed,just be happy you dont have the old googlevoice style sms forwarding the contacts name is embedded at the start of each sms message thus the hangouts notification shows the name three times
Android,not_removed,does swiftkey beta have this
Android,not_removed,fucking finally
Android,not_removed,can someone verify if this is also present on previous versions of android if not hangouts team done fucked up google intentionally made it backwardscompatible to honeycomb
Android,not_removed,gif keyboard support is only for hangouts conversations doesnt work for sms
Android,not_removed,specifically dont think supports this
Android,not_removed,link to keyboard
Android,not_removed,i tried out an iphone for two weeks if that and i will miss the gboard dearly
Android,not_removed,new feature you cant delete multiple conversations at the same time if one is a hangouts and another is sms
Android,not_removed,bug fixes and performance improvements the changelog for every google product ever
Android,not_removed,they might spoil us with both
Android,not_removed,its snappier for sure
Android,not_removed,changelog bug fixes and performance improvements ftfy
Android,not_removed,this and youtube seems to follow the same rules
Android,not_removed,was i the only one having major mms issues lately
Android,not_removed,also disabled video integration use duo instead group chats will be added to duo in
Android,not_removed,i wish i had a good reason to use spaces tbh
Android,not_removed,but muh imessage s
Android,not_removed,eh facebook messenger sadly here
Android,not_removed,you mean facebook messenger because no one ive ever known uses whatsapp its as useless as allo is to me
Android,not_removed,nope
Android,not_removed,or search period nope
Android,not_removed,google reader will return first
Android,not_removed,if youre rooted and have xposed get the module xhangouts ymmv but i had to do a little version shuffling with hangouts and xhangouts to get all of the conversations to work correctly but it was worth it imo
Android,not_removed,grab a chair
Android,not_removed,i used it before fi as well but i agree it is the best suited app for fi integration by far i lost my phone a few months ago and just used my laptop or tablet as a phone coupled with the call forwarding until the new one arrived
Android,not_removed,sliding in here because i have fi and use hangouts have you ever experienced a delay in receiving hangouts messages while on lte
Android,not_removed,oh gods the desktop version is so bad now especially if you run multiple chrome profiles google logins
Android,not_removed,is there something else i missed from the desktop version or are you referring to the update that among other things broke the chatheads or whatever they were called in hangouts since thats the fb messenger name
Android,not_removed,when what i use mine every day please no
Android,not_removed,i have no solution but wanted you to know youre not alone in experiencing these issues
Android,not_removed,the best part is nougat super doze that doesnt even bother to ring when receiving a call
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,i cant wait to send the ceo a roll eyes gif
Android,not_removed,s
Android,not_removed,i planed to but dp forced it to
Android,not_removed,theres a special place in hell for people like you p well done
Android,not_removed,you mfker it will never happen
Android,not_removed,thats going to be added to allo hahahahaha
Android,not_removed,i just noticed also bummer because i like all the distinguishing colors for apps bummer that google send to be moving away from this
Android,not_removed,whatsapp web fills the gap also hangouts is a mess it is consistently slow at everything
Android,not_removed,are you using an device
Android,not_removed,sadly i dont think this will get fixed it only pulls in pictures if the person has a google profile with a photo that they have set as their profile picture
Android,not_removed,hangouts will be for enterprise allo will be for consumers
Android,not_removed,do your contacts have google pictures
Android,not_removed,nope
Android,not_removed,yeah i was wondering why it wasnt showing up dumb
Android,not_removed,wow that is such bullshit
Android,not_removed,just the google keyboard heres how
Android,not_removed,the bug was that the system was performing too well so we fixed it
Android,not_removed,play store change log the reason for this is ab testing google does a lot of small test rollouts as do other developers use the google blog for major update change logs it isnt perfect and it can be frustrating
Android,not_removed,increased my sot by hours
Android,not_removed,removed features available on desktop
Android,not_removed,tbh the share menu in youtube has gotten a lot faster a few months ago
Android,not_removed,i always thought group conversations where there is a center topic that you can make the title and post specifics for those that only check their phone once a day but dont want to read through hundreds of messages to get the latest information
Android,not_removed,i moved earlier this year and it was very helpful to brainstorm furniture ideas for different spots in the new place that and linking placesideas for things to check out on upcoming vacations that and shared keep shopping lists for party planning have been very helpful
Android,not_removed,spaces is great for work but i fear theyll kill it before they fix bugs
Android,not_removed,yeah its nice to store data for a penpaper round but honestly using a shared folder in dropbox is easier
Android,not_removed,i use it to stash all kinds of links i have like five different spaces for work play and subsets of each but honestly im worried that one day theyll all be gone after a typical google product purge
Android,not_removed,pah ignoring two niche countries iphones are so rare that imessage is a glorified sms client and sms arent all that common any more either
Android,not_removed,i stand corrected
Android,not_removed,different people use different apps thats the point
Android,not_removed,i guess fb messenger whatsapp for me everybody i talk to is on whatsapp i guess everybody is on messenger too but we dont use it much on the other hand nobody and i mean nobody messages me on the google apps even though i have them all installed
Android,not_removed,everyone i know the us uses fbm while everyone uses whatsapp internationally
Android,not_removed,what do i use now that ive deleted facebook getting people to use something permanent with an accountnot fb or texting is like pulling teeth
Android,not_removed,weird in the uk its pretty much the primary messaging app not many use facebook messenger anymore
Android,not_removed,good to know im not the only one with this problem on my wifes phones it happens in second i thought it was due to the fact that i have over people in my address book
Android,not_removed,right after season of firefly and half life ill let you all know about how awesome it is through google wave
Android,not_removed,youre screwed if you dont have root and get a new phone though hangouts comes preinstalled these days at or you can force a downgrade to with merged conversations using adb but upon reboot itll be replaced with unmerged again i rooted my just for hangouts
Android,not_removed,what i miss are the little windows that i could dock at the bottom right of my screen and theyd float above other windows i could keep a couple conversations open throughout the day it was very user friendly
Android,not_removed,im referring to the old floating dockable windows that werent pretty to look at but were at least functional my new version wont stay on top even if i turn on that option it also often opens up as a tiny toolbar that i then need to resize i just leave it maximized now and alt tab over to it
Android,not_removed,they got rid of version and im not very happy about it
Android,not_removed,thank you i love google voice for voicemails but its starting to become a steaming pile of garbage due to google neglect
Android,not_removed,oh god i know that is frustrating
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,theres a special place in hell at google for people like you ftfy
Android,not_removed,i just would prefer not to have a browser based solution when they could easily figure a way to authorize devices considering whatsapp web exists
Android,not_removed,not sure actually its a note i know its arm but dont know if its bit
Android,not_removed,ill believe this when it actually happens
Android,not_removed,will regular users still be able to use hangouts then
Android,not_removed,oh
Android,not_removed,no but it used to assign the pictures i used i dont think they even have google accounts also it still shows their pictures on the contact page before i go into a chat but then in the chat they are all just faceless green heads
Android,not_removed,i want a gif keyboard greatly but i cant abandon the amazing text prediction and correction why cant you add in the gif keyboard swiftkey
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,theyre usually do quick to update to new features im so sad
Android,not_removed,can you send gifs over mms
Android,not_removed,most of us know the reason we just think its stupid i mean its not like no one solved this issue so far
Android,not_removed,how
Android,not_removed,giggled a little bit about still not integrating google voice features continuing to require users to go to google voice website that hasnt been updated in years to manage their voicemail options
Android,not_removed,it still has a reply icon though for some damn reason
Android,not_removed,what is keep
Android,not_removed,those people shouldnt be using group chats
Android,not_removed,my mom doesnt have facebook and lives in a different country whatsapp is great for communicating with her messages and free calls and the recent addition of video calling is a bonus
Android,not_removed,but isnt everyone international s
Android,not_removed,is there something inadequate with fb messenger i use it
Android,not_removed,i do but they all use facebook messenger
Android,not_removed,i personally do not have any contacts outside of us whatsapp is more useless than allo
Android,not_removed,what do you use for sms im using google voice sms via hangouts so a lot of my communication is done in there only one person actually uses hangouts messaging with me though
Android,not_removed,i dont think you have to have a facebook account to use fbm anymore
Android,not_removed,me too i always run into this and its super annoying and downright unusable i really havent seen people complain about this so i thought it was just me also glad its not just me
Android,not_removed,or orkut
Android,not_removed,thank you i started noticing it over the last few days gonna tweak some network settings and see what happens
Android,not_removed,this still exists does it not im using the chrome extension and these little windows
Android,not_removed,holy crap i thought this was just me top left of the screen the entire window is the size of the minimizemaximizeclose buttons
Android,not_removed,yeahi kept getting so frustrated at the standalone pluginapp behavior that i eventually uninstalled it and went neck to the regular browser instance it felt like the folks that developed and tested the standalone hangouts chrome app tested against actually reallife use cases
Android,not_removed,ah yeah ive noticed all of that as well its annoying
Android,not_removed,i still miss when it was google talk man remember when it auto filtered people who were online to the top of your list there are people i havent talked to in years because theyre way down at the bottom and i just never bother scrolling down
Android,not_removed,ah i prefer the extension app thing would be nice if it was a full featured program
Android,not_removed,thats why i tend to use hangouts through inbox instead of the httphangoutsgooglecom site you can only have a few chat windows open at a time on the latter so annoying
Android,not_removed,np bb
Android,not_removed,its called the allo team
Android,not_removed,looks like the usa version of the note is bit the international version looks like it has bit hardware but i cant tell if samsung shipped the phone that way lucky for you there is a bit version up on apk mirror now
Android,not_removed,not sure they might have to unless allo starts to support google voicefi
Android,not_removed,yep does this for me too still doing it after the update boo
Android,not_removed,yep i have this as well everyones icons from my own contact list or g look fine in the main screen of hangouts but then when i go into the actual thread of conversation for someone who doesnt have a fucking g account and its just the generic green icon only people who have added a google account picture get to have something visible in chat itself thanks google
Android,not_removed,hmm i have the opposite issue contacts and group chats have broken pictures but in chat theyre fine edit this update fixed it
Android,not_removed,sir you are welcome
Android,not_removed,technically yes but the file size has to be as small as the sending and receiving carrier networks will support via mms that lies somewhere between and basically a really shitty gif you can barely have a quality photo fit in that size much less an animated one beyond that its up to the messaging apps on both sides to understand what gifs are and how to play them
Android,not_removed,by being a joke
Android,not_removed,remove all software and services so you boot up to a blank screen mad sot
Android,not_removed,reply icon forward icon actually
Android,not_removed,i just use onenote
Android,not_removed,if you want to provide feedback to the allo team it would be great if you could include multiple selection of messages to delete or forward and multiple selection of images to send as well other than multidevice access of course i am so sad that the allo team completely dropped the ball on this one by making the first version so so so far behind whatsapp that no one would actually even start using allo
Android,not_removed,all of which fb messenger does to
Android,not_removed,i just use google messenger works great for what it is its just most people i know dont use sms anymore mostly switched to whatsapp and sometimes fb messenger
Android,not_removed,you dont but it requires the same dumbass permissions and stores everything you say and listens in on you and other intrusive bullshit
Android,not_removed,you dont
Android,not_removed,i just search for the person in contacts and message their number from there
Android,not_removed,after updating the chrome extension i no longer have the option my guess would be either your chrome or your extension has not been updated ive read that recent chrome versions dont allow docking
Android,not_removed,yes you have to go into settings enable transparent ui i personally hate the little bubbles being over everything so i am very happy this is optional
Android,not_removed,haha yep
Android,not_removed,yep happens to me multiple times a day
Android,not_removed,this drove me crazy had to stop using the chrome app and just use the webpage instead with a pop out window for my daily conversations
Android,not_removed,haha i forgot about those days
Android,not_removed,wew get a room 😌
Android,not_removed,yeah update didnt fix mine ether ugh
Android,not_removed,yea fixed it for me too
Android,not_removed,hopefully it fixes mine then waiting for a version
Android,not_removed,i learned the other day that awsms does gifs flawlessly even my imessage using friends can send them to me
Android,not_removed,with its schizophrenic disappearing and reappearing critical features different features on different platforms that make your own documents unreadable on some platforms but readable on others and that lockin to microsofts ecosystem
Android,not_removed,too
Android,not_removed,absolutely never said it didnt i just prefer whatsapp
Android,not_removed,thats the chat heads feature and not the docking chat windows from the the old extension
Android,not_removed,this happens when i dockundock my laptop my fix because i usually cant find the window is to do a windows key left on the keyboard to dock it to the left side of the screen then adjust the size back to normal
Android,not_removed,were in a room well then lose some weight
Android,not_removed,sick burn
Android,not_removed,with its schizophrenic disappearing and reappearing critical features what critical features ive been using onenote since i bought an og surface pro for college and ive seen nothing but features added also youre comparing this to google who is a mess when it comes to their products and oftens kills them on a whim
Android,not_removed,get on out of there
Android,not_removed,i dont use it anymore on principle it tries to be the default sms app which pissed me off a bit it didnt offer it just defaulted then told me i could change it facebook has been trying to get my phone contacts forever and i cant fathom a reason as to why it would need them there is a reason they are separate maybe it doesnt listen but it sure as fuck does give me highly ludicrously creepy accurate ads within hours of me talking to someone about something for the first time i thought maybe it was the whole buy a red dookicky see red dookickeys everywhere thing but ive been paying attention and fb shows me brand new ads that are directly relevenat to me on a near constant basis been wanting a new tablet and havent typed those words anywhere on the internet in over years until this very second but i told my gf that i was looking for onewhile i was browsing the trash on my fb feed and what do you know asus nvidia samsung apple they all suddenly published ads for their latest and greatest tablets and i got em within an hour and thats with all permissions but the absolute necessities turned off on all apps good timing maybe but i dont want it anymore regardless also for whatever reason im still waiting on nougat on my its been patched up as of this month so im not terribly worried
Android,not_removed,god i miss futurama
Android,not_removed,well you know facebook owns whatsapp and if you really think that facebook is nefarious enough to monitorparse every conversation by everyone with the app to target ads at people then surely you know theyre doing the same thing with whatsapp and not telling anyone
Android,not_removed,and ive uninstalled it now i guess ill stick to texting fucking sick of this crap
Android,not_removed,they spent cost on a pretty good sony sensor for the and built a api that supported all the features people want they literally did all the hard work of actually creating a good camera but just refuse to put them together just dont understand google sometimes
Android,not_removed,i dont want more photo grids i want more controls and long shutter speeds
Android,not_removed,this is about minutes of development work i hope they actually put some more work into the camera software its been a year since anything has happened
Android,not_removed,the main reason i didnt upgrade to another nexus from my nexus was the bad camera experience does the development team honestly not get that the google camera experience is very bad i just dont get the google camera path its a very poor ui a good camera ui would not force you to swipe to a new screen to simply access still vs video recording it would simply have two different buttons in the same viewfinder screen is there honestly something im missing about the complexity of doing that launching google camera and immediately trying to swipe over to video recording always results for me on my nexus and on my wifes in an unresponsive ui and by the time it becomes responsive the moment to capture is gone if the time its why i have zero regrets for getting an edge this time around if a nexus phone had the camera stability response app interface and autofocus capabilities of the with the photo processing results of google camera without grinding to a halt after taking a few hdr it would perhaps be my ideal device
Android,not_removed,i really hope that htc wont fuck up the nexus cameras
Android,not_removed,thanks but i want to save my photos to sd
Android,not_removed,place the take photo and record video buttons in the same god damn screen
Android,not_removed,if i have an am i better off using the camera app on my phone or does using googles camera app make it even better with more options
Android,not_removed,let me select an external audio source from a mic plugged into the headphone jack please
Android,not_removed,here comes the million ap articles detailing every little thing they can find from that rom dump that evleaks sent them
Android,not_removed,reminds me of hangouts and the messaging apps we are getting google in general i think never makes since
Android,not_removed,more fine aperture exposure control please and working exposure control for the and silky smooth fps video would be great too edit sorry i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,voice shutter please
Android,not_removed,but but muh grids
Android,not_removed,i just wish camera wouldnt bug out so much on the stock app then again one plus camera app is doing freaking wonders
Android,not_removed,shutter and aperture controls i can agree with even something simple like the very useful exposure compensation that they took back out but very very few people will ever use long exposures on a phone i guess it really doesnt matter if its added but considering how few uses the feature actually has and how few people would actually use the feature its suggested far too often like its some sort of killer feature
Android,not_removed,came here to say this you saved me time up votes for you
Android,not_removed,google will very likely handle the camera post processing etc like last time
Android,not_removed,stay with the stock app for your phone
Android,not_removed,you shouldnt expect that feature i think exposure control is as far as theyll go after this
Android,not_removed,are you saying its a bad thing and no he did not send us any dumps
Android,not_removed,stock doesnt even have thats criminal
Android,not_removed,all things more important to camera usage than grids lines
Android,not_removed,what android phones have manual aperture controls right now
Android,not_removed,yes video the sensor can do but google just refuses for some reason
Android,not_removed,i might be wrong but i thought phone cameras have fixed apertures
Android,not_removed,long exposure as in they have us shutter control but limited it to second max why limit it
Android,not_removed,i hope they do google is the absolute god at post processing no added sharpening and dear lord the hdr 😍😍
Android,not_removed,how do you like your bro would you buyrecommend a nexus device based on it
Android,not_removed,keep them coming sooner the better
Android,not_removed,stock can basically do one thing with its software take a picture fps camera options filters adjustments image stabilization even voice shutter i really think people own a nexus just to say that they do in threads where its about what phone will you buy people literally say nexus because nexus besides the stock and quick update experience and smoothness of the phone because nothing is offered i dont see the fandom it creates
Android,not_removed,its not really possible but having manual controls like iso shutter speed and exposure compensation in a new api but not supporting it with the stock camera is ridiculous
Android,not_removed,theres already manual aperture exposure control on my nexus just have to enable it in the settings menu ive read its broken on the some say its fixed in n but others say its broken again but on my nexus its in increments of id like smaller increments like or not really sure what other phones have but since many phones eg have raw support id assume they would have manual aperture controls too edit sorry i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,google just hates us thats all there is to it lol
Android,not_removed,sorry i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,why limit it because most people dont have a tripod for their phone and theres no way you can handhold anything slower than a second hell even of a second without it being crazy blurryunusable i mean like i said unlocking it as an advanced option couldnt hurt but so so few people would ever use it and itd be crazy to unlock it in automatic shots because theyd come out like junk in dark situations anyway
Android,not_removed,and no god awful watercolour looking noise reduction like on lg and other phones
Android,not_removed,not op but i would buy a nexus htc the phone is pretty stock anyway but being a full fledged nexus would be great
Android,not_removed,for the most part i like it but i keep getting very meh to average battery life though some seem to be getting test battery like sot which i can only dream of seeing at this rate id probably wait to see what the nexuss bring if nougat is releasing next month they shouldnt be too far away
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,you can download party apps to augment any shortcomings in apps on nexus you cant download apps that will augment quick update experience or smoothness
Android,not_removed,yes im aware of the api and its capabilities the other guy probably had his terminology a bit mixed up smartphones have fixed apertures google camera is years at this point and we only got exposure comp now
Android,not_removed,sorry i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,yah its all there in the api just offer an advanced mode already
Android,not_removed,i believe youre talking about exposure compensation the apertures are fixed on these small cameras
Android,not_removed,how can there be aperture control when theres no variable aperture
Android,not_removed,precisely i think you are confusing terms here as far as i know smartphones have fixed apertures
Android,not_removed,of course it would be in advanced settings it would be in manual mode there are plenty of ways to use long shutter without a tripod the issue is dont introduce features and not support them they made a big deal about having all these manual controls but then tell the user you cant use them to their full potential they put a sweet sensor in the current nexus line but completely gimped the app that its just a joke now they make a big fuss about grid lines grid lines
Android,not_removed,you totally can handhold with ois and very stable hands of course the and lack ois which makes it harder i can usually get it to work on my htc with a sec exposure as long as im very still and in a pose that i can easily hold it also helps immensely if i can prop my arm on something not easy but definitely doable and the low light results are really worth it
Android,not_removed,thanks dj khaled
Android,not_removed,the stock camera apps are always the best to use because of the post processing though hdr mode takes great pictures and party camera apps cant recreate that i want all these features in one app i dont want to have to switch between camera apps your argument works for most apps but definitely not the camera app
Android,not_removed,yep sorry guys i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,ah got it i had a shot at understanding the comment properly
Android,not_removed,oh yep i mixed them up thanks fixed now
Android,not_removed,sorry i meant exposure not aperture
Android,not_removed,yep sorry i totally mixed them up
Android,not_removed,heck ya they would thats money in the bank to them
Android,not_removed,there are plenty of ways to use long shutter without a tripod like what i guess you could do some weird light painting thing but the shake of your hand while its being done would make the lines look squiggly and junky even for a panning motion shot you wouldnt really ever need anything that slow again not saying that it wouldnt be nice if they took those limits off just that i dont think a lot of people requesting it understand what exactly theyre asking for completely gimped the app i dont disagree with that i mean honestly im fine with exposure compensation alone but they inexplicably removed that from the latest version which is stupid the other manual settings i could honestly take or leave but it wouldnt hurt to have them in there grid lines i dont disagree i cant imagine more people using grid overlays than simple useful stuff like exposure compensation makes very little sense
Android,not_removed,not for the stock camera is shit and i still dont understand why
Android,not_removed,no worries dude p happens to all of us
Android,not_removed,just propping the phone against something would be fine the average user would have no clue how to use the shutter speeds but for those who are photography hobbiests sometimes the only camera on them is a phone i would have loved to have had good shutter controls o the im not saying its for everyone but there are more than a small group that would use the feature hell having it on a phone could be a persons first interaction with manual photography and could lead them into getting into it more passionately all that said my main issue is dont have features and not support them
Android,not_removed,id argue that would just be the hardware i dont think the nexus had a great camera the and are the first nexus phones with good cameras
Android,not_removed,you might be right idk though i think its pretty decent but for whatever reason it trips quite a bit using another camera app though fixes the issue almost completely
Android,not_removed,youre correct but on that front youre also wrong both the and the have decent hardware but the common theme with nexus phones yet again is somewhat competent hardware crippled by the software google simply does not have a grasp on photography software

Android,not_removed,every dev got email for the changes and everyone knows maybe your dev decided to not allow this and then got a bunch of request and changed his mind
Android,not_removed,i wish weather timeline was retroactive for family library
Android,not_removed,i actually just logged in to post the same thing i emailed several this morning to make the request and have gotten two answers so far the first was from krzysztof głodowski of neatbytes the developer behind solid explorer and he was more than happy to enable it for the solid explorer unlocker i wont name the second responder at the moment but their response was a negative personally id recommend putting a list of developers and their responses in your post and editing as you and other hear back from them
Android,not_removed,maybe i need to read about family library more but i opted in and thought it was only for play tv music and movies how would third party apps work for us sharing iaps
Android,not_removed,im not american is this february some early implementation for forward compatibility or july this system of putting the month first never made any sense to me
Android,not_removed,why should they though i feel like this move by google really just fucks over developers even more apps already sell for so little tablet versions are now integrated into the main version and now this
Android,not_removed,i would love to do this for hermit but apparently inapp purchases are not supported for family library if youre reading this and bought hermit yourself email me at hellochimboricom and i might be able to get you a free promo code for your family member be sure to include the google play order number i cant guarantee everyone will get one because there are only a limited number of promo codes we are allowed to generate but ill see what i can do cheers looking forward to formal support for inapp purchases so i can enable family library for everyone and remember httpshermitchimboricomhelpstudents
Android,not_removed,or pay your favourite dev for each person that uses his or her app its especially easy with google opinion rewards i have £ of credit that i am unsure how to spend at the moment i donate again to my favourite developers from time to time
Android,not_removed,i signed up for family library invited my girlfriend and shared a few apps yet i dont see the family library tab in the my apps games section and my play store is uptodate according to the settings is it because only ive shared apps and thats why i dont see it
Android,not_removed,everyone email weather timeline i already have
Android,not_removed,i dont know he seemed pretty genuine his exact words were i didnt realize this was something i needed to optinto but sure enough it is and i did hes not a big time developer having only downloads for this particular awesome btw app so i doubt he got a bunch of requests maybe its not that he didnt get the email that all devs got but that he didnt initially realize that he had to optin to previous purchases an understandable oversight that others devs could also have had
Android,not_removed,solid explorer 😍 i hope you praised the guy for making such a solid explorer
Android,not_removed,iaps cant be shared only apps that are purchased from within the play store and i dont think play music is included in family library although a play music subscription does have a family plan
Android,not_removed,yes july to me starting a date with the month makes more sense we are in the month of july what day in july the july what if i had been kidnapped for several months and didnt know the date after escaping i walked by and asked you the date and you simply said the because youre accustomed to saying the day first instead of the month now i after just escaping my captors have to ask you a second question about which month it is had you said july there would be no need for a follow up its also more efficient with the number of the day first i have to add extra words when saying the date the of july as opposed to simply july plus americas way is always the correct way duh
Android,not_removed,people are more willing to buy apps if they know their family member wont have to repurchase to enjoy as well
Android,not_removed,im still waiting for my first survey literally havent gotten a single one since the apps inception
Android,not_removed,right you wont see the family library tab only the people you add will however when you look at your list off all app from within the play store youll see several apps labeled family library
Android,not_removed,he probably just skimmed the email p google play sometimes contacts developers but its rarely stuff you should quickly acknowledge and act upon
Android,not_removed,what app was it jooc
Android,not_removed,youre goddamn right i did and yes i saw it
Android,not_removed,why not year first then yearmonthday is the best one
Android,not_removed,youve got some wild imagination
Android,not_removed,no of course not id say of august or august id still write day shortest time period month next in length year the longest anyway daymonthyear do you see how theyre sorted by length of time period in an ascending order its clear that first comes the shortest
Android,not_removed,what are you on
Android,not_removed,if my family members get the apps then i dont go out of my way to root and send them apks
Android,not_removed,yes please im not a developer but it kills me when small devsdesigners charge like for an amazing app and abandon it because theres no incentive to update it anymore since everyone who wanted it bought it
Android,not_removed,though when they originally set the price it was for one user if they optin then it retroactively changes that one user purchase into multiple users they can change the price for new users but then opting in defeats the point
Android,not_removed,this is most likely because the app does not have access to the location and contacts permissions you have to grant them to the app yourself in the app manager in settings
Android,not_removed,change your google profile to say youre a year old hispanic housewife and youll get loads no joke
Android,not_removed,yeeeep they send way too much that i dont need to care about so i forget to care when i need to
Android,not_removed,the app was metamorphabet i wanted to be able to log out of my primary email address on my daughters months device its an awesome app if you have children between and its worth buying its one of only two games that i let her play
Android,not_removed,millej is this the reason why the family share option on the store listing page for solid explorer doesnt yet show up for me yet i too have purchased the unlocker on my gmail but now want to share this with my family once the dev agreed did this checkbox show up on the listing or alternatively did it then show up under the family tab on google play store for the users you intend to share it with one other general question are the apps only shared from the family manager to the others or the other way around as well
Android,not_removed,i consider it equal to dmy as long as theyre sorted by length then i dont mind if its in ascending order or descending order id get both just fine but only if youre including the year
Android,not_removed,thanks 😲
Android,not_removed,the drugs
Android,not_removed,neither method helps the developer so whats your point
Android,not_removed,this was way before manually allowing permissions was even a thing and ive tried this already i get no surveys regardless
Android,not_removed,check its httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidplsolidexplorerunlockerhlen there should be a switch for you to turn it on i believe that if you told it to automatically activate every purchase it would have turned it on automatically but im not sure the switch showed up on the listing in my account the family tab in the play store is for apps shared by those in your family as of right now i dont believe theres a way to find out what apps have had it activated by devs other than by flipping through all of your purchased apps which google still makes incredibly annoying to do as for shared apps it goes both ways assuming the other family members have shared their purchases as well
Android,not_removed,perhaps youve botched the introduction interview then d
Android,not_removed,thanks millej for the quick response the unlocker play store listing doesnt have the switch thats what i was wondering if the switch showed up for you after the dev responded to your request its weird that the listing does show it is family store eligible but doesnt actually have that switch
Android,not_removed,i have a folder with all my monthly bank statements ymd is how i name all those easy to sort
Android,not_removed,in filenames i totally agree that ymd is superior anyway ymd is totally fine by me as long as the year is present without the year i do dm
Android,not_removed,the switch showed up after i emailed him and have you checked to see if its showing up on the website like actually follow my previous link on your computer or in a browser that doesnt just redirect to the play store app on your phone and see if the switch is there if it is its just the play store app being stupid and i would clear the cache test it and then clear the data if the cache didnt fix it just remember that clearing the app data will make you configure any app settings youve already set if its not there i would contact play store support and see whats up
Android,not_removed,yes thats exactly what i did clicked your link on my pc before my previous reply and i didnt see the switch on that listing on the google play website and neither on the play store app on my phone so i figured the switch would only show up once the developer responds and does something on his end which sounds like what you experienced as well
Android,not_removed,i dont believe that theres any way for the dev to activate it on a per user basis so if im seeing it you should be too do you have family sharing activated where do you live
Android,not_removed,thats odd then i am not seeing it and i have family sharing enabled both on my account and my familys so i can see their apps under family tab on my play store and vice versa but this unlocker app does not show up am in usa might try clearing the datacache for play store and seethanks again
Android,not_removed,if it wasnt showing up on the play store site on your computer im doubtful that clearing the datacache will help let me know what you find and youre welcome
Android,not_removed,wish people would stop calling these renders leaks
Android,not_removed,fake or not i like how that looks
Android,not_removed,my god in heaven it looks just like a flat brick of a smartphonetablet groundbreaking
Android,not_removed,a fancreated render not a leak
Android,not_removed,agreed so so much
Android,not_removed,that game is hard with a controller i dont even want to imagine with a touchscreen
Android,not_removed,what they need to release is megaman battle network aka rockmanexe where each person could have their own petavatar on their smartphone and go around battle each other via an action card game system plus you should also incorporate theme park elements to represent the net like the original game cant believe they are not thinking about this after the success of pokemon go
Android,not_removed,this is a shitty port of a shitty port they made for old cellphones in japan fps is really shitty wait for reviews
Android,not_removed,i saw every frame in the trailer plz no
Android,not_removed,megaman were extremely hard with touchscreen as in not getting halfway through any level hard you really need to feel the buttons in your hand punch out however i was able to almost beat i used a nes emulater on some basic android games ran fine or at least as well as they did on the nes
Android,not_removed,ap showed some comparison clips between these and the old nes ones and the android version looks like hot garbage horrible frame rate
Android,not_removed,if they dont allow controller support then this is doa
Android,not_removed,who the hell wants to play an action platformer on the worst possible controller i guess its nice for people who have android tv with a controller but then its easier and cheaper to use roms
Android,not_removed,for megaman six fans theres dozens of us i bet you should check out vurez on youtube hes made some great remixes
Android,not_removed,im guessing now that tmobile is giving away codes for these games since theyre going to introduce some kind of event at the same date and hinted at it being game related
Android,not_removed,why not using emulator anyway plus you can map controller
Android,not_removed,will there be a pc release too touch controls on mega man dont seem appealing
Android,not_removed,noh thanks
Android,not_removed,not worth it unless they replace wood mans theme with
Android,not_removed,they have released mega man x for ios i beat that game and thought it was easier than the original version why wouldnt these versions be easier or fine to use on a touchscreen
Android,not_removed,i wonder how many idiots will buy these games to play them with touch screen theyre unplayable without controllers
Android,not_removed,platformers are hard with a touchscreen id play on instead
Android,not_removed,whoa the actual classics for mobile nice hope they support gamepad
Android,not_removed,where is battle network doe
Android,not_removed,legends
Android,not_removed,why everyone is so obsessed with this game
Android,not_removed,itll be harder at the frames per second it runs at since they ported a port of the games and not the originals
Android,not_removed,i agree but theyre still gonna get my money anyway even if i just have the icon in my app drawer and never play it after the first month ill be happy
Android,not_removed,i bought a controller just to play the nes version on my phone
Android,not_removed,that would definitely fit smartphones since it would be very close to the original plot a lot more than pokémon go actually
Android,not_removed,plugging the megaman battle network rbattlenetwork
Android,not_removed,that would be fun
Android,not_removed,i love this idea
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,im into that
Android,not_removed,oh god yes please
Android,not_removed,please yes
Android,not_removed,jack in megaman execute
Android,not_removed,i beat a level in on extreme difficulty the one where the floors are all moving i think dont remember its name im not a real hardcore fan but i couldnt beat the other levels so
Android,not_removed,but does it have sms fallback
Android,not_removed,i havent even heard that theyll support controllers
Android,not_removed,ill use
Android,not_removed,because some people like to support the official release
Android,not_removed,you dont understand it probably because you didnt live the nessnes gold age that game was the mark of a childhood for the a lot of us who played it is a hard game in the clever sense as in with clever ai instead of the overpowered bosses we get today and the sensation of rewarding you get when you finally beat them plus that you also get a new ability each time you beat a boss
Android,not_removed,spoken like a true fan
Android,not_removed,thats some pretty insane consumerism
Android,not_removed,namelinkreviewother details for the controller
Android,not_removed,with touchscreen i actually found jumping the right distances to be quite hard
Android,not_removed,i guess people are tired of supporting the same rererererelease of a near year old game by now
Android,not_removed,dreams do come true
Android,not_removed,i dont think its just the nostalgia those games are just good
Android,not_removed,fairly obsessed yes
Android,not_removed,obsession is the term i use
Android,not_removed,i got this zero to travel around with i have a logitech for the full experience but the zero is really portable i chain it up to my backpack and bring it whereever i go link i guess the only thing i am disappointed is the pc support its a nightmare to hook it to a pc but android works great
Android,not_removed,i got some random bluetooth controller about a year ago on amazon it has a little holder for your phone so it turns into something that looks like a shield portable its not great but its something i can keep in my bag and pull out whenever i want to play some mario or zelda or something
Android,not_removed,yep using an nes emulator on my phone it wasnt easy ill grant you
Android,not_removed,and do you think this rerererelease comes for free do you think the developers of the rerererelease worked for nothing
Android,not_removed,i said the same thing maybe just to boot it up and listen to the music while on the go give my nes not that expensive emulator thing the original top loader a rest
Android,not_removed,thanks for the info mate logitech for the full exp err this aint compatible with android stuff right
Android,not_removed,the point is after so many rereleases people care less
Android,not_removed,i actually listen to megaman music while driving sometimes its on google play music
Android,not_removed,yep thats for my pc although if your phone supports otg it also works im using an edge btw
Android,not_removed,that is very handy info in all thx again cheers
Android,not_removed,they keep adding more and more features but the keyboard continues to get slower and slower
Android,not_removed,maybe youre shopping for an engagement ring and dont want big diamonds to show up in your predictions when someones borrowing your phone – incognito has your back yeahah sure thats the reason i want incognito mode not say because of embarrassing search terms
Android,not_removed,wish theyd copy google swipe space bar to move the cursor
Android,not_removed,i just went to the settings to check out the new phrases support and i noticed that it now has a builtin clipboard history too how long has that been there
Android,not_removed,good now maybe my keyboard will learn when i am and absolutely not looking for porn jebus forbid someone type the word gay into my phone you can guess swiftkeys suggestions for yourself
Android,not_removed,can i make it stop inserting spaces after a period yet
Android,not_removed,if anyone is having issues with predictions getting worse right after an update please send us a pm as this is something we are looking into right now cheers
Android,not_removed,ive used swiftkey forever it seems like every update it gets slower and less accurate im about to start looking for an alternative swiping is basically broken for me it never gets the words correct while it used to work like a charm
Android,not_removed,i just now realised that with flow disabled swipe up toggles the caps lock key
Android,not_removed,i remember a time when swiftkey was actually the single best keyboard app on android it was fast it was smart and it was beautiful now it looks dated is slow full of bloat and a pain to use i am still looking for a keyboard app to replace fleksy now that it wont get updates anymore but i am not able to find one ill probably keep using it until a new android version kills it
Android,not_removed,just a headsup to the one that posted here first youre shadowbanned
Android,not_removed,i have the update but i dont see the updated hub
Android,not_removed,does it support custom backgrounds yet like the google keyboard
Android,not_removed,there should be an option to disable the new transliteration thing they baked into the new beta that is killing it for me
Android,not_removed,still no cursor control
Android,not_removed,does newer versions of swiftkey still not support changed dpi on android n it looks completely terrible when i change the dpi via the display settings on android n
Android,not_removed,oh gosh ive been off of swiftkey since they were purchased by ms but i decided to try this build out im astounded that a keyboard application can be so laggy ive spent close to on this app over time but they have become consistently worse than the free competition
Android,not_removed,i love the new option for creating shortcuts but its ridiculous that it doesnt sync across devices so i have to remake all shortcuts to every device
Android,not_removed,cant save shortcuts for email addresses is an invalid character
Android,not_removed,i just hate how the httpiimgurcomsojdbeqjpg that auto spacing
Android,not_removed,if only swiftkeys predictions werent crappy with every passing year and i hadnt lost years of sync info suddenly
Android,not_removed,one of those apps that is so so so much better than the google equivalent unless you have an iphone and can enjoy superior google apps like googles special keyboard and ads so much to the platform
Android,not_removed,something is wrong when you have an incognito mode in a keyboard
Android,not_removed,yeah i really wish they could fix that somehow
Android,not_removed,and predictions seem to be getting worse
Android,not_removed,google keyboard just does one thing very well all the people i have told to download the google keyboard too have never looked back it came with my device so im definitely biased but why would i want to use anything else
Android,not_removed,slower how
Android,not_removed,probably is better suited for an advertisement than beeg american teetees my cousin roman always searches for
Android,not_removed,then they have to create another shortcut for us to change languages
Android,not_removed,i enabled the two cursor buttons on the main keyboard much much more easier to control cursor
Android,not_removed,thanks for the fr
Android,not_removed,idk why every praises this feature its terrible itd be more useful if it slid one character per swipe like messageease does instead i have to swipe really fast and then recenter or else it wont work or it will ask me which keyboard i want to use its faster to just move the cursor above
Android,not_removed,weeks on beta days on stable
Android,not_removed,dont have it installed yet but i thought that was a setting that was off by default at least on my gfs phone it was
Android,not_removed,you still cant what is the issue with this for you
Android,not_removed,were always looking to improve on all typing fronts thanks for the feedback
Android,not_removed,how about google keyboard i use it the most on my android device when im not on iphone
Android,not_removed,what
Android,not_removed,you sure do you see clipboard and incognito mode
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,i typically need transliteration but i need a toggle for it like google indic keyboard has hinglish hindi transliteration is ruining the prediction and each swiped word is taking a second to show up
Android,not_removed,hi there we have made loads of fixes for this it should not look broken at all what are you seeing
Android,not_removed,i keep hearing this but ive never experienced lag on swiftkey what does it do thats slow it pops up as fast or faster than google keyboard or swipe for me and registers as fast as i can possibly type which is quite fast this is using a nexus and unrooted
Android,not_removed,unfortunately yes we understand syncing this would be nice and were exploring this
Android,not_removed,indeed predictions have really worsened quite a lot i also lost sync months of sync though it took me time to create that dictionary i was left with stats only
Android,not_removed,theyre good if you use the personalization feature from within the app
Android,not_removed,crappy have you even tried neural yet
Android,not_removed,i really like swiftkey but for me swype has more accurate predictions and when those predictions are wrong there are more options to choose from to correct it i like that swiftkey has a number row option and an option to move the cursor with arrow keys though and that their material themes show the longpress alternate characters on the keys
Android,not_removed,nah sometimes i want to misspell things intentionally and not have it correct them to that forever
Android,not_removed,i just want a good looking theme while having squares around the letters they help me tyoe more accurately just one decent theme please
Android,not_removed,your in loving memory brought out a hearty chuckle
Android,not_removed,yep almost all predictions are now wrong and literally all predictions are wrong if i enable two languages add transliteration to the mix and i rage quit it back to google keyboard for now
Android,not_removed,really mind expanding on this does it happen after an update or just a general decline in quality
Android,not_removed,but dude the prediction text doesnt work with the google app or google chrome its so weird if they fixed that id drop swiftkey in a heart beat
Android,not_removed,simultaneous language support and permanent number row are the top reasons for me not sticking to google keyboard on any phone
Android,not_removed,alright lets say im typing a word such as reality and in the context that im using it is in reality you can get any result well ideally when youre using a word in the proper context it should naturally be able to readily insert the word for you however itll get caught on the slightest misswipe and throw me a completely different word also seems to be a bit laggy in swipe for facebook but that could be swipe itself
Android,not_removed,cousin hm
Android,not_removed,yeah the quick language switch spacebar is really awesome
Android,not_removed,how do you do that it only shows arrows on mine not
Android,not_removed,volume buttons for cursor movement on cyanogen is a god send
Android,not_removed,i tried that but i keep hitting them by accident when i reach for space bar
Android,not_removed,when im entering a web address iirc also passwords with punctuation the dot com part always gets spaced hmm seems to be browser dependent i use dolphin browser and it adds spaces chrome doesnt though
Android,not_removed,it is a good keyboard you are right but it isnt enough to get me to switch just yet its generic
Android,not_removed,good but no permanent number row
Android,not_removed,when i posted my comment it said this thread had already one comment however there werent any this means the user who posted the first comment is shadowbanned
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,which annoys me because i like my google keyboard custom background but i really like swiftkeys ability to switch between languages seamlessly ugh
Android,not_removed,i was wondering if its just me hindi transliteration is so slow i had to disable the hindi keyboard entirely
Android,not_removed,eggjacktly i loved the hinglish mode and was on swiftkey primarily coz of that dictionary but now stuff i write shows as a mishmash of hindi and english and its just utter crap
Android,not_removed,httpimgurcomedkvunh this is what it looks like on an earlier version on the second to highest size setting while my dpi is set to via the nougat settings this is how i like it and prefer it if i were to do this on the latest version of swiftkey it would just be significantly shorter even on the largest size setting so completely broken is the wrong way to put it since it still works i just wish the keyboard didnt shrink with the rest of my phone since its not like my thumbs are shrinking when i change the dpi lol thanks for responding if you need to ill put a screenshot of what it looks on the latest version as well
Android,not_removed,neural is amazing but damn do i hate that magenta theme
Android,not_removed,use super swiftkey its on xda and comes with hundreds of free themes
Android,not_removed,i bought material minimal
Android,not_removed,now that all of them are free try material phosphor green
Android,not_removed,actually using incognito just because i like the theme xd
Android,not_removed,lol thanks not sure why you got downvoted apparently everyones bitter it got recalled
Android,not_removed,finally someone who gets it i havent had swiftkey predict anything properly for quite a while now
Android,not_removed,wow thanks for reaching out unfortunately i dont have much details to share as i wasnt really keeping track swiping is one of those things like voice input you give it a shot at first but if its not perfect most of the time then the hassle and frustration is greater than the benefit gained so you just stop using it ive been using swiftkey since the beta in and flow seemed to work well enough when it was later added but over time it began failing enough that it was easier to just peck from the start id give swiping another chance every now and then but it didnt improve and this last time it seemed to fail on almost every other word
Android,not_removed,yeah whats up with it i noticed this as well it doesnt make much sense
Android,not_removed,yeah its a bit but i got used to it on ios for like years beforehand
Android,not_removed,so the flow quality is poor is your concern here we ran an experiential apk to collect some detailed data to make some improvements to gesture typing as far as this lag is it lag when you type or flow the word and there is lag in the word appearing on the screen
Android,not_removed,it is isnt it
Android,not_removed,swiftkey typing keys extended layout
Android,not_removed,or if you have xposed gravitybox adds cursor keys to the navbar when you have keyboard out or theres one mod for swiftkey that adds numbers row on top of the keyboard and adds cursor keys on both end of that row anyone remembers the name of that mod
Android,not_removed,with web addresses if you start with http or www we go into url mode and wont add any auto space triggering for entering in a password if in a password field we should not be auto spacing but if youre typing in a password in a normal text field we wont know this and thus trigger auto spacing
Android,not_removed,just tried it with wwwredditcom and it never added a space in it
Android,not_removed,does fleksy have swipe typing yet or does it still only use that for gestures delete etc
Android,not_removed,ohhh interesting how did you come into this knowledge i find it amusing that we are both downvoted as i cant think of the type of person who would downvote both of us out of anything but a bad mood edit lol wtf i feel like people are downvoting me for the lulz at this point feel free to comment and explain why my comments arent adding to the discussion
Android,not_removed,no it doesnt they could have just deleted their comment too
Android,not_removed,we hear you loud and clear on this
Android,not_removed,well all the themes are now free like all of them
Android,not_removed,thanks for clarifying i believe we attempted to fix something regarding this but introduced a new bug wait for our next market release or beta and see if this changes anything it should fix the sizing issue if not please submit a ticket by going to supportswiftkeycom cheers
Android,not_removed,there are many themes you can choose from i use carbon light myself
Android,not_removed,never heard of that xda labs app
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,oops every theme went free today
Android,not_removed,wow thats actually great
Android,not_removed,know what really really grinds my gears even tap typing is giving wrong suggestions how the hell is that even possible the word i wrote by tapping each letter is shown on the left end of the suggestion bar and the default center one is some other random word dafuq
Android,not_removed,still works great for me but i need to clear out all my learned predictions every months or it just gets too bloated only takes a day or two to get used to me again but its far better after
Android,not_removed,okay so you are speaking more about flow quality we ran a special test apk to collect more data on how flow is used and are going to use this to see how we an improve on flow keep an eye out for some improvements
Android,not_removed,i wish i knew what the deal was but yes google keyboard is way faster
Android,not_removed,you guys just made every theme free im using spotlight blue right now but why did you release all the themes
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,ok yeah i installed it again and it seems to be occuring in dolphin browser but chrome is fine i guess ill start using www for dolphin now thanks
Android,not_removed,yeah it seems to be a browser dependent
Android,not_removed,fleskey has been dead for several months they were acquired by pinterest
Android,not_removed,only for gestures not a problem for me though because fleksy is way faster and more intuitive the way it is i tried swiping even when swype was the only keyboard that featured this but never really liked it it feels just wrong mashing over the keys also i type with both thumbs and while there is an app i believe its called monkey keyboard or something like that which allows you to swipe with both thumbs simultaneously works pretty good actually i never really got into it knowing that the development of that app is dead or at least was when i last tried it
Android,not_removed,ohhh interesting how did you come into this knowledge ive seen it a couple of times before and i think its good courtesy to mention it to help the shadowbanned user
Android,not_removed,neither of you are contributing to the topic reddiquette says you should be downvoted
Android,not_removed,ill look into the latest beta since ive only been using the latest play store release thank you
Android,not_removed,they finally added them i missed that update thanks
Android,not_removed,i think one of the du guys makes it there are updates in the team blackout app theres an xda thread though its pretty great
Android,not_removed,ha youre welcome while i have you let me just slip in a request for more characters checking the show all characters box in the settings still leaves me with httpsenwikipediaorgwikidiacritic i try to use not showing up also you took out the em dash from long holding the en dash used it so often maybe a secondary toggle for extra all characters the more the better in lieu of that id want to save my own template smilies or strings of text see rraiseyourdongers
Android,not_removed,well i bought it like a year or two ago so im not mad thanks tho
Android,not_removed,but how do you know thats not some sort of server error or something i agree with you though
Android,not_removed,hover over the downvote button for content that does not contribute to any discussion im having a discussion with you im having a discussion with the other dude according to your interpretation of reddiquette you ought to be downvoted as well you may be an exception but i will laugh at anyone who seriously argues that downvotes reflect peoples opinion on whether a comment contributes to any discussion people downvote to punish opinions comments and attitudes they dont like nearly universally i asked gartenriese what he meant because i was unfamiliar that isnt the sort of comment intended to be downvoted according to reddiquette
Android,not_removed,nope not if its a top level comment it only says that if you reply to someone try it yourself
Android,not_removed,itll be coming out in the near future
Android,not_removed,but how do you know thats not some sort of server error or something i dont but i dont think the reddit servers are that slow
Android,not_removed,oh didnt know that
Android,not_removed,mhl adapters are notoriously unreliable for video mirroring you may be better off just picking up a chromecast itll be much less cumbersome than having a cable hooked between your tv and phone the chromecast is about the same price as well
Android,not_removed,it wont work the galaxy was the last samsung phone with mhl both the and dont support the standard anymore
Android,not_removed,it wont work the like most other phones removed mhl support
Android,not_removed,i have one for my samsung note tablet and it works great though i had to fight with the order of the connections and the power to get it all to work well worth the trouble though
Android,not_removed,i was actually intending to capture the phones screen with a desktop internal capture card but im probably better off just using a webcam for my purposes thanks though
Android,not_removed,doesnt note have mhl
Android,not_removed,why not use a screen recording app there are quite a few on the play store and they all work fine with the i use this one httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomspectrlrec
Android,not_removed,couldnt you just plug a chromecast into your capture card
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,yawn
Android,not_removed,top tier galaxy s series note top midrange galaxy a series top midrange china galaxy c series low midrange galaxy j series lowest end galaxy hope this helps
Android,not_removed,this of it this way s super a average j just crap
Android,not_removed,╰ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° つ──☆・ﾟ
Android,not_removed,i feel like there wont be another e series ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,what about the on series
Android,not_removed,thats a great way of remembering
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,is it really uemvy explained it hours before you made your comment
Android,not_removed,mid range for places like india
Android,not_removed,i dont know we sell a lot of on at my store for metro
Android,not_removed,tmobile and metropcs both sell the on line in the us
Android,not_removed,why isnt this phone getting more attention it seems to have almost everything that randroid is looking for in a phone
Android,not_removed,definitely gonna be waiting for reviews on this to replace my maybe seems like a great package for the affordable flagship category hopefully its true when they said itd be fully compatible with tmobile in the us
Android,not_removed,in the almost minute video the phone only dropped one percent that bodes well for battery life im hyped
Android,not_removed,this phone feels like the spiritual successor to last years moto x im very excited to hear more about this device
Android,not_removed,this could be the most underrated phone of the year
Android,not_removed,the phone also has an option for hardware buttons similar to oneplus family of phones the black bar at the bottom can be used for hardware buttons thats great because it has an amoled screen and software button may result in uneven burn ins with time this phone is imo the flagship phone of the year even without its ridiculous pricing
Android,not_removed,missing band for nz extended can still get it in the main centers so will be buying it anyway looks like a great device for the price
Android,not_removed,if only the screentobody ratio was as high as zte makes it look when the phone is off but when its on you see that there is a fake screen black area around the real screen
Android,not_removed,was going to be all over thus until the asuses asii were announced
Android,not_removed,im so excited to upgrade to this from my current this thing is terrible but i have an honest question although this looks amazing on paper what are some honest concerns when it comes to buying a phone from china for such an unbelievably cheap price i rushed into this sony and im extremely worried of making the same mistake but i still can bring myself to buy a samsung or apple
Android,not_removed,a chinese phone with all around flagship specs a non appleesque ui affordable price and is planned to be compatible with my carrier sprint completely sold
Android,not_removed,zte is stepping their game up i might drop my nexus for this lol
Android,not_removed,awesome phone only downside is that you cant use simcards when you want to use a microsd card since slot is a hybrid slot would love to hear the price of the version
Android,not_removed,when will this be available for purchase
Android,not_removed,i wish they couldve fit a mah battery a la into this beauty out of the flagships this is the only other phone with dual front facing stereo speakers apart from the x performance which is way too expensive complete opposite of the valueformoney of the axon so it seems this will be my next phone i do wish zte has good dev support
Android,not_removed,there are some people with the chinese version at xda doing an ama on this so far it seems great software seems to need some work and im still not sure if the bootloader will be unlocked but if it will work on cdma then i finally have a new phone to get and dont have to wait another months for the nexus line to release thatll be a relief
Android,not_removed,the specs looks nice but i think the design is absolutely terrible maybe if there was a black color variant it would look better
Android,not_removed,there was a thread posted last week that got comments ive felt like theres still some inherent prejudice against chinese flagships mostly because the chinese phones have a reputation on them hardware wise this is literally every goddamn thing that ive been looking for well see how the ui feels in day to day usage but thus far i cant see a reason not to purchase this phone
Android,not_removed,micro sd decent capacity battery front facing speakers snapdragon usb type c this is pretty much my perfect phone
Android,not_removed,i was going to say the same thing if you check my comment history ill probably sound like a broken record but this phone should be this subreddits golden child it certainly is for me its almost unbelievable how perfect this phone is shaping up to be
Android,not_removed,because there no reviews on it yet
Android,not_removed,it actually made me erect and already cant wait to get my hands on this my only gripe with this correct me if im wrong is that there is no led notifications note galaxy and htc havent made me this erect
Android,not_removed,this is my next phone my wallet is ready
Android,not_removed,i dont know tbh its amazing deal for what you get the big ones for me is front facing speaker amoled fast charging clean no button front and that sweet glass smash protection
Android,not_removed,becuase the same as the alcatel yes alcatel is a china brand since they licenced the brand for mobile phones to tcl and other china economy phones even with qualcomm processors the sources are rarely released and updates are few and rare before getting one check the xda forums for the original axon and see how its been updated
Android,not_removed,same boat this is the first phone that ive seen that i actually want since the
Android,not_removed,yeah the worried me but if its at least halfway decent on battery life and excels in all the other areas that the specs are so promising i will probably go for it edit it now occurs to me he had no sim in so it wasnt on data so thats at least something to remember
Android,not_removed,to be fair for the first minutes or so the phone wasnt turned on at all so it was only minutes and for a lot of the time the guy was just talking while holding the phone and not doing anything on it so its not like in real life its going to discharge only every minutes thatd equal to hours of screen on time btw but hopefully itll still have a great battery life
Android,not_removed,im glad im not the only one who noticed this help me spread the word about this phone
Android,not_removed,i was thinking the same i might just upgrade to this if the nexus line is subpar this year
Android,not_removed,i too was annoyed with the new moto x it was the chosen one
Android,not_removed,source
Android,not_removed,band is pretty signficant here in australia too even in areas with other bands it works so much better indoors
Android,not_removed,the black bezel on the bottom is actually a capacitive button
Android,not_removed,all white front phones have a black bezel around the screen with varying sizes
Android,not_removed,xiaomi style this has been popular lately and i hate it i chose the black mi strictly because of this even though i otherwise would have preferred another color that said xiaomi mi is amazing and black looks really good
Android,not_removed,that is the only thing that i can critique on this phone side to side is pretty good it top to bottom is a little large im assuming its for speaker driver space like with the htc phones
Android,not_removed,me too i like the look of the axon but the asus phones should have better dev support so more custom stock roms and such
Android,not_removed,asus phones are usually loaded with bloat this looks pretty minimal
Android,not_removed,i might be mistaken but i believe they are designed in usa the main issue i think will be making sure they give timely updates zte doesnt have a great track record but there most recent zte devices do have marshmallow i believe we can count on having n on this one because the whole phone was built with google daydream in mind which is an n feature set also they promised n update soon
Android,not_removed,if it fails you will have lots of fun attempting to cash in on your warranty
Android,not_removed,there is only a very few triple sim or phones
Android,not_removed,but there is
Android,not_removed,zte has had a global presence for awhile if anything their problem would be more of a history of making lower end phones
Android,not_removed,whats the chinese reputation im genuinely curious is it security wise or more of longevity
Android,not_removed,ill ride the negative train for a second if it was it would be an instant buy it will still probably be my next phone based on the priceperformance ratio but im a little sad about the size i just hope it gets some aftermarket support seems a little less likely with zte phones
Android,not_removed,dont forget about the fact that its the first phone to be compatible with google daydream
Android,not_removed,the only complaints this sub might have are size too big not big enough and maybe lack of unlockable bootloader
Android,not_removed,good point on the led notification it would be really strange to see an android device without led notification im guessing the led is just hiding behing a hole from the speakers like my htc but it would really be a bummer if it wasnt included
Android,not_removed,zte has a traditional circle shaped hardware button that is used as a notification light as well the black bar above the bottom speakers have capacitative buttons i think thats where the notification light is its not possible that they missed such an essential feature
Android,not_removed,im erected as well
Android,not_removed,even wifi calling and volte with tmobile
Android,not_removed,it now occurs to me he had no sim in so it wasnt on data very true i was just glad it wasnt draining like the moto x i had for a couple days seems like it will have at least decent battery life
Android,not_removed,dropping after minutes of sot is still very good
Android,not_removed,its still a great device
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,im never really anywhere long enough without wifi to really worry
Android,not_removed,do you have a source for that i hadnt seen any info about that and its be an interesting feature
Android,not_removed,its weird the mi note was pretty good in this respect and the took most of its design cues from its older brother leeco are worse for it they dont even offer black or grey options for their devices typing this out on a meizu note and despite its black front the actual gap between edge of display and edge of surrounding front panel must be less than a friend of mine has the black and i have to agree it looks great but i wish that wasnt the only solution
Android,not_removed,whats the battery life like
Android,not_removed,zte actually has us based service i think based on their us website
Android,not_removed,my post is days old there was not confirmation about black color variant back then
Android,not_removed,amen to that i had a zte excuse for a smartphone in or i have no fond memories of it the only thing it did moderately well was take calls and convince me that cheap phones blow
Android,not_removed,usually seen as cheap copycats of apple but i think that perception is changing especially after huawei made the nexus
Android,not_removed,both neither are justified for the big chinese oems at least
Android,not_removed,they also have a reputation of bloating up the ui with all kinds of apps
Android,not_removed,im considering getting it just because the htc isnt
Android,not_removed,if youre looking for a smaller phone with similar specs you might want to look at the its a phone with the same sd of ram and usb c its screen plus the slightly larger battery should give you a bit better battery life it should also have excellent aftermarket support with roms and everything oh and the best part is its almost half the price of the axon at only
Android,not_removed,is not that much bigger no
Android,not_removed,they have a mini coming out
Android,not_removed,and maybe long waits for updates
Android,not_removed,so if anyone is interested there is a forum for zte known as the zcommunity in one of the threads one of the zte heads said that an led notification light does exist in the top left corner of the screen edit heres a screenshot
Android,not_removed,i dont know which axon is in that video but the us models ive seen are all virtual buttons which is admittedly a letdown after seeing that ill try to find out a reason for the differences
Android,not_removed,there is no front facing button
Android,not_removed,i hope so thatd be huge for me
Android,not_removed,it is but it wont discharge linearly in this video it dropped in minutes but later it might drop in just minutes we cant base anything on this video
Android,not_removed,i dont think there is actually i cant find that stated anywhere i hope thats true but i highly doubt it
Android,not_removed,not anymore though
Android,not_removed,its absolutely disgusting how much the huawei tries to be an iphone
Android,not_removed,thats the nice thing about opinions
Android,not_removed,absolutely if the htc was it would be my next smartphone i have big hands and i still struggle from time to time with my oneplusone
Android,not_removed,hm i did see the zuk and i like the whole more open to modding the one i saw said it only had a mah rather than the your link has im in the us though so band availability will probably be an issue plus i think id want the sd slot the axon has one the doesnt but size and price hmmm i wish there was more info on whether or not zte will help it be more dev friendly
Android,not_removed,not really i care more about width though plus i really want not even sadlynot where the market is going
Android,not_removed,its only rumored they seem to have a design for it but on the community webinar said it would only be released with enough community demand which is odd how to gauge demand for an unannounced product and if the leaked german specs are accurate it would lose out due to the lowered internal specs
Android,not_removed,and maybe long waits for sure updates zte has a good track record for updates
Android,not_removed,awesome thanks for pointing that out i was actually worried it might not have a led notification light
Android,not_removed,oh have you seen them in person if so this would be a very sad omission id prefer capacitative buttons
Android,not_removed,there is i saw a chinese video that demonstrated it on the mobilecant search for the link right now
Android,not_removed,the nexus supports it
Android,not_removed,i couldve sworn that i read it will support wifi calling and volte doesnt the unlocked htc support it
Android,not_removed,called a rep thats your bad source right there
Android,not_removed,actually the axon pro got update in december which allowed volte and wifi calling so its reasonable to expect that this phone haswill get it too
Android,not_removed,theres been no mention of that in any of the hands on videos ive watched and i havent seen a single video where the user taps the black bar i think utoteppp is blowing smoke
Android,not_removed,i have both they are not similar at all unless if you count the antenna lines on the bottom of the phone and the ui ill agree on the ui but you can always just use the preinstalled themer to change it the htc on the other hand
Android,not_removed,oppo plus is much worse
Android,not_removed,looks like a great phone to me
Android,not_removed,you probably looked at the zuk pro which has a slightly larger screen and the battery the nonpro version was just announced today im in the us too on tmobile and it should be fully supported you can check httpwillmyphoneworknet the regular version comes with or you can bump up to the version thats still less than the axon just curious how much storage do you use consistently the front facing speakers plus the supposedly high quality dac in the axon is certainly tempting though
Android,not_removed,i think that the best is over but less than if you want less than then iphone is your bff
Android,not_removed,really so i guess the complaint i saw in an xda forum dated about the axon elite still not being updated to marshmallow was a fluke or does their track record vary by region
Android,not_removed,same worries here now its a im getting this
Android,not_removed,i found out ive been playing with the older model newer model with capacitive buttons is the one which will be launched in the us regarding the led notification light on the older axon there is a tiny one to the bottom left of the earpiece but since the circles nav is coming back who knows maybe theyll get rid of the top light and just use those as you said
Android,not_removed,i dont see any or
Android,not_removed,yes the unlocked htc supports it
Android,not_removed,here and if youre not a fan of the mifavor ui you can switch it to a stock like ui or viceversa i think i heard it somewhere on youtube now im hoping that it will have a greyblack variant to hide those bezels
Android,not_removed,im not talking about the hardware
Android,not_removed,i dont use tons of storage in my music player i have a gb card but i need more like a to fit my whole collection i just like having an sd card for media storage and enough storage on the phone for all the apps on the is a bit restrictive is a good value to have some future proofing unfortunately it only gets a yellow check on lte for att edit actually it only gets yellow on tmobile too fddlte ，，，， tddlte tdscdma that wont be great us coverage at all
Android,not_removed,or sony compacts but those are overpriced for the performance sadly much less for the than for the stupid
Android,not_removed,dunno about the elite but their pro is getting a marshmallow
Android,not_removed,wow thats great news i cant find any fault in the phone at all
Android,not_removed,i wish you wouldve searched more anyways heres the link to the video
Android,not_removed,oh shit this phone has just become better for me now i assume you can also use the buttons on the stock like ui right edit it seems like its only a chinese variant that has the capacitive buttons which is really weird to me
Android,not_removed,im not disagreeing that huawei takes heavy inspiration from apple in terms of their ui but what if people wanted the same aesthetic icons in squares with rounded edges without ios is that really something to hate them over im sure a company as big as theirs did proper market research on what kind of ui customers like also there are plenty of themes to choose from it just so happens that the one thats on by default is the apple inspired one
Android,not_removed,ah got it looks like it might not be the best fit for you then
Android,not_removed,i dont see a button there except onscreen buttons no physical buttons edit oh ok i see it now its not onscreen buttons but capacitive buttons ok my bad thank you
Android,not_removed,the axon im using right now doesnt have those sweetlooking capacitative buttons theyre virtual ill try to find out whats going on different models or change in design
Android,not_removed,did you click on the link the black bar above the bottom speaker is not a part of the screen htc and also had it if youd take a look at it the link clearly shows capacitative touch buttons on the black bar the other option of onscreen button is also present on the axon but that is on screen above the black bar at the bottom
Android,not_removed,maybe theyre virtual by default looks like theres a setting to turn them on in the video would be awesome if you can confirm definitely a top pick for my next phone
Android,not_removed,i clicked the link check my edit thanks
Android,not_removed,ive been told all the devices on hand are of the older model which have virtual nav buttons the newer model with capacitive bezel is the one which will be launched
Android,not_removed,awesome thanks for following up now i just need a confirmation that the bootloader will be unlocked sound like theyre listening to their customers
Android,not_removed,i am a mod over at can you give me more info and sources about the old vs new model
Android,not_removed,non video link maybe description
Android,not_removed,i stopped using facebook app and moved to a party wrapper app
Android,not_removed,maybe its just me but facebook has had legitimately no negative effects on my battery regardless of whether or not its on my phone i still get around hours sot
Android,not_removed,what are you talking about every time a user here does an actually controlled test they find that facebook and messenger both have a negligible impact on battery life and that it has been this way for close to years the only people complaining are the ones with anecdotes about how this one day facebook had a large drain the problem is the users actually trying to do this scientifically are not upvoted whereas the mindless complainers are in fact some have even found that the wrapper apps are more likely to trigger the mobile radio active bug on some phones and cause more drain than the full fledged app
Android,not_removed,the battery fiasco for me to ditch that app learning more about its intrusiveness has kept me from wanting it back having the one touch login through the web browser makes it so quick and easy to get to facebook when i want theres just no need to use their spy app
Android,not_removed,folio pro is what i use been using it since no complaints
Android,not_removed,battery is not an issue but ram is its pushing my moto g limit to the max
Android,not_removed,using swipe pro i completely forgot all about the official app
Android,not_removed,i moved onto tinfoil then just one day decided to fully give up on facebook havent looked back since i aint got time to waste nor do i wanna look at stupid memes and inspiration crap anymore if i did id just load up imgur no ones bothered to even call or sms me in months to see if i was still alive thats how much self centerped people are on fb
Android,not_removed,the battery issue wasnt new just a revisit its been a problem for years and periodically gets an article or pushed for awareness or fear or whatever the intention is i actually discovered the problem myself before blogs took off with it some years ago when you needed root and a party app to control app permissions i noticed battery draining significantly and checked wakelocks didnt find any obvious wakelocks but i did see fb was waking up my phone thousands of time in a day so i put fb permissions to ask for permission to do anything so i could see what it was doing its complete spyware even when not in use even if they did something about the battery issues i dont agree with the frequency they spy on my activities and the types of data being collected fb doesnt need my contacts every goddamn time i send or receive a text for example
Android,not_removed,doubtful since the large majority of fb users will continue to download it because they are afraid or unaware of party apps most casual users read the majority of the market only use party apps and the most popular apps they dont care enough about battery life or performance to do anything about it
Android,not_removed,facebook and messenger always appear for me in the battery usage list no matter how much or how little i use them on a charge plain and simple i respect the controlled tests done by various people and i also respect the testimonials of those who say the apps have no significant effect for them but that is my experience the battery life impact is also quite visible even more if i do not turn on afwall for fb and messenger while i use them from a pc it is also not related to my phone it has happened to every android phone ive had in the past years i know reddit does not like to hear about the facebook apps draining battery but it happens consistently for me
Android,not_removed,battery life hasnt changed i still get more than a day off of a battery the placebo affect is truly amazing
Android,not_removed,that is exactly what i did as well but i really do not notice any battery usage due to facebook on my edge i bought swipe pro app on the google play store and love their amoled theme but i hate how it does not actually push any notifications to me if i set it to refresh notifications every minutes minimum then it just chews up my battery i tried setting chrome to send me notifications but realized that pms still take forever to get to me unless i keep clicking the refresh button what i really want is an amoled version of facebook that is supported and updated by facebook
Android,not_removed,yeah absolutely no effects on battery on my phone i have some issues with the app itself mainly design but its never caused my phone to slow down or use any significant amount of battery
Android,not_removed,maybe its just me but facebook has had legitimately no negative effects on my battery regardless of whether or not its on my phone i still get around hours sot same here no difference in battery life after using a wrapper for the mobile site for a week huge drop in usability though
Android,not_removed,youre not alone both facebook and messenger apps havent taken a toll on my battery or performance
Android,not_removed,you are not alone took off the app from my phone and battery is the exact same hours sot
Android,not_removed,the wagon is cruising at mph why are you infront of us brake checking
Android,not_removed,try swipe its better
Android,not_removed,swipe pro has been spectacular i am super impressed by the app and the developer
Android,not_removed,its basically an incredibly simplified version of reddit i wouldnt miss you if you stopped posting it coming in here just like fb lol
Android,not_removed,my old housemates facebook has turned into a meme videos page the only thing i really use it for is messenger and some pictures here and there
Android,not_removed,you mean dark theme
Android,not_removed,and i still understand the point of the wrapper when you can use the mobile site in chrome and still get notifications unless theyve broken mobile messaging entirely that is
Android,not_removed,no sir i mean amoled theme
Android,not_removed,lcd theme
Android,not_removed,cry well deserved upvote
Android,not_removed,at some point google needs to ask for a restraining order oracle is just harassing them at this point
Android,not_removed,i looked at for a map
Android,not_removed,oracle please go eat a patented dick
Android,not_removed,they will pay for our open source software even if it takes million lawsuits
Android,not_removed,oracle plz no oracle stahp
Android,not_removed,finally does this mean its over no more court battle i waited for so long for this each time there is a verdict in googles favor there is a retrial can google sue oracle for wasting their time and money
Android,not_removed,someone wanna sue oracle with me
Android,not_removed,jesus chris oraclelet it gooooo
Android,not_removed,oracle is good at doing that
Android,not_removed,have they honestly ever done anything but
Android,not_removed,so a site that just brings you to amazons link
Android,not_removed,it lists all battery cases for the phones listed available in amazon and ebay as well as the reviews available on it so instead of searching and wading through the accessories its strictly battery cases makes money off of commission has articles written

Android,not_removed,the article says this is for tvs so whether this even belongs here is dubious tvs will probably become predominantly oled too but that may be a decade away or so maybe longer even since lcd isnt static and is still making improvements
Android,not_removed,apple decides to go amoled and makes this a bad investment at least on mobile devices
Android,not_removed,im not an expert but it seems like a massive investment for a display technology that will inevitably be replaced by oled can anyone explain why this made business sense
Android,not_removed,can we round it up to for oled
Android,not_removed,whatever happened to izgo
Android,not_removed,with mainstream oled tvs around the corner is investing this much money into lcd even wise obviously they know what theyre doing but i wonder their reasoning
Android,not_removed,should build one in america trump would approve
Android,not_removed,lcd why the hell
Android,not_removed,lcd on mobile devices isnt going away anytime soon
Android,not_removed,today the massive electronic manufacturing company foxconn announced a new partnership with sharp to build and operate a new tv lcd flatpanel factory in china which will cost billion read the article stupid
Android,not_removed,i think theyre making monitors and tvs
Android,not_removed,there is some new lcd tech that is supposed to be present in the iphone or whatever they call it in its standard sizes and oled tech in the iphone x anniversary addition inch
Android,not_removed,foxconn said that the lcd factory will make displays along with screens for smart tvs and electronic whiteboards production is expected to begin in
Android,not_removed,everyone tries to paint it black and white on here currently the best displays may be oled but that has its disadvantages as well and it doesnt mean that theres no future and no market for lcd screens
Android,not_removed,oled will replace lcds when oled no longer produce screen burn in i saw in stores a few weeks after release with screen burn in already they also use pentile sub pixel array inferior resolution they wont be replacing lcds anytime soon they have a very long way to go to be even close to lcds quality and performance
Android,not_removed,will inevitably be replaced by oled oled will always have burn in it will get better but will still exist that puts it completely out of the question for many uses
Android,not_removed,today the massive electronic manufacturing company foxconn announced a new partnership with sharp to build and operate a new tv lcd flatpanel factory in china which will cost billion
Android,not_removed,it disappeared just like all the other cool stuff we actually want
Android,not_removed,yes build an lcd factory nowhere near any of the actual device manufacturers no logistical problems at all
Android,not_removed,sure he would
Android,not_removed,amoled is nice but lcd might get better if they invest more into it today the massive electronic manufacturing company foxconn announced a new partnership with sharp to build and operate a new tv lcd flatpanel factory in china which will cost billion
Android,not_removed,in big numbers it is
Android,not_removed,with mobile vr gaining steam low persistence is a big requirement and right now oled is where everyone is heading
Android,not_removed,uh besides lg and apply who else is currently using amoled
Android,not_removed,most people buying tvs dont really care about quality they want them to be cheap
Android,not_removed,best displays
Android,not_removed,oleds will always burn in the next generation display after oled is microled displays its similar to oled in that there are individual subpixels that produce different colors of light but it doesnt have the problem with lifespan its only a matter of when it can be mass produced at a reasonable cost
Android,not_removed,store phones arent representative of everything theyre stuff full brightness on the same demo pictures and media pentile makes it last longer and at qhd and higher resolution is fine my note and note have burn in even my galaxy nexus the burn in issues are real but not as major a deal as people make it seem
Android,not_removed,maybe thats why trump would approve
Android,not_removed,i mean they made blackberrys in mexico up until last year
Android,not_removed,sure but oled has advantages over lcd that lcd can never achieve
Android,not_removed,surebut oled is more expensive and still has its issues lcd displays are still good for nearly anything and wont be fully replaced anytime soon
Android,not_removed,i dont see vr becoming mainstream some people will use the hell out of it but a lot of people will maybe try it once and then be done
Android,not_removed,lcd apple lg htc huawei sony amoled samsung motorola oneplus zte
Android,not_removed,sony and huawei use lcd displays
Android,not_removed,every flagship phone
Android,not_removed,i think its a cost benefit analysis my friend just got an oled tv but he doesnt have to worry about money im guessing he paid what he would have for for a comparable led backlit pannel
Android,not_removed,now this sounds exciting the benefits of oled without burn in is a win all around how will this work with the sub pixel density will this be something like pentile where we lose sub pixel density compared to rgb is lcd doing anything to compete with this
Android,not_removed,youre downvoted for criticising oled
Android,not_removed,really i had and gnexus and they are the reason i decided never to get a oled screen phone ever again they got burn in in the first month or two with regular use i then had to use a moto x because i had no choise for a short period of time and the same thing happened burn in really fast so yeah i dont know how you did not get burn in but i know for a fact it happens and it happens fast
Android,not_removed,oled can never be as reliable as lcd will never own oled again for as long as it can be avoided i love the way it looks when its new but the burn in ruins it
Android,not_removed,im pretty sure oled became cheaper than lcd panels last year
Android,not_removed,zte is oled on exactly one of their devices
Android,not_removed,most of the recent nexus and pixel are amoled too iirc
Android,not_removed,microled should have full subpixel arrays no sharing like most oled
Android,not_removed,i had a galaxy nexus too and modern oled screens seem a lot better
Android,not_removed,and i know for a fact it doesnt have to happen im a heavy user and dont leave the screen on brightness all the time lol the only people i know with burn in are lg phones and moto e those are lcd and theyre not exactly burn in i think it has something to do with the adhesive or something not pixels
Android,not_removed,burn in is really not an issue anymore lots of new technology has been made to shift the pixels around to avoid it i would pick oled over anything else we currently have in every scenario
Android,not_removed,amoled i think is belong to screen manufactured by samsung xiaomi is using oled
Android,not_removed,xiaomi uses amoled on their higher end mi line and the redmi pro lcd on the lower end redmi line
Android,not_removed,i only compared flagships
Android,not_removed,not one actually
Android,not_removed,friends has burn in
Android,not_removed,xiaomi only used oled on mi note and redmi pro nothing else
Android,not_removed,whew
Android,not_removed,lad
Android,not_removed,yes id say within year july the bestselling phones from lg samsung htc lenovo will all have typec within years i think itll be harder to find a phone with microusb than typec
Android,not_removed,its the new standard so yes pcs motherboards and laptops already have them maybe not right away as id imagine the cost is still significantly more expensive than micro usb but in the future i can see most devices using it honestly it wouldnt surprise me to see a future iphone with usb c they already are starting to put them on their laptops why stop there people will be pissed but itll be significantly better
Android,not_removed,and even to the apples iphone world nope even after apple released their laptop with usb typec they introduced two accessories magic trackpad and magic mouse that have lightning ports for charging i dont see them doing something as significant as changing the ios device port for many years
Android,not_removed,yes except for the iphone sticking to proprietary connections is very beneficial to apple
Android,not_removed,usb and usbc are an international standard obviously it will reach the entire world and a lot of range of devices unlike the lightning port that is not even on macbooks
Android,not_removed,i doubt apple will ever add a typec port to the iphone not just because they want to profit on a proprietary cable but also so they can implement a sort of forced quality control on cables usbc is a mess right now as some phones have a typec connector without some dont support certain transfer features due to proprietary charging implementations and some manufacturers lock out accessories from working with other devices also apple is the only manufacturer currently capable of pushing a proprietary standard and actually have it be picked up by other manufacturers
Android,not_removed,usbc as implemented in mostall android phones to date uses the usb protocol theres nothing stopping any phone oem from switching all their phones to use usbc wusb apart from the obvious supply chain lead time and the additional cost usbc entails the bigger change will be moving to usbc but leveraging the usb or protocols thats going to take several years longer than usbc itself the physical spec to filter down to entrylevel phones itd require a more expensive soc and more expensive cables shipping with every phone apple will likely never implement usbc until its possible to somehow use the spec to enforce drm on accessories apple wants to control the accessory market headphones data cables chargers as the margins they make on cables is obscene
Android,not_removed,ive always enjoyed the abundance of microusb cables whenever im at a friends house even if they use apple products they will most likely have a microusb available too bad this means more fracturing in the android experience i know its the future but im just wondering if well ever be able to experience some standardization in the near future
Android,not_removed,im really hoping that devices that everywhere we find micro usb today will be replaced with usb c in the future
Android,not_removed,usbc has a big problem right now where the physical connector is no longer tied to the capabilities of the port weve spent the last ten years training everybody that the usb port can do usb things now with usbc its just a physical shape maybe it can do display port maybe it can do quick charging maybe it can do maybe it can do all kinds of other things its up to the devices my company was considering usbc charging for a recent product and decided to go with something proprietary instead simply because it wasnt clear what capabilities a usbc charger could provide the proprietary charger however can always provide the required voltage to do a charge time which is what our customers require
Android,not_removed,it will never be on apple as they wouldnt get to sell their proprietary cables type c will be on everything else shortly
Android,not_removed,does usb type c make file transfers much faster
Android,not_removed,i doubt apple will ever add a typec port to the iphone not just because they want to profit on a proprietary cable but also so they can implement a sort of forced quality control on cables usbc is a mess right now as some phones have a typec connector without some dont support certain transfer features due to proprietary charging implementations and some manufacturers lock out accessories from working with other devices also apple is the only manufacturer currently capable of pushing a proprietary standard and actually have it be picked up by other manufacturers
Android,not_removed,to modify your post a bit years for a smartphone or popular dumbphones the super cheap throwaway phones will probably keep micro or mini usb due to costs
Android,not_removed,is it better than lightning ports in technical features or is it just better because of standardization
Android,not_removed,pcs dont have them or usb because intel decided to not include usb with skylake chipsets and amd is taking its sweet ass time releasing the chipsets
Android,not_removed,hmm im not considering to trade android for ios but id like to see iphones with a universal cable port standard chargers makes everyone happy
Android,not_removed,how does apple enforce any type of quality control there are plenty of cheap crap cables and chargers dont see how that is much different from usb
Android,not_removed,well usb could enforce quality control like usbif for devices but they dont
Android,not_removed,apple is already using typec though
Android,not_removed,it will standardize the same way micro did it wasnt that long ago everything had mini and you had to hunt for a micro if you got one of those new fangled ports on a device before that pretty much everything was proprietary
Android,not_removed,yup me too
Android,not_removed,im avoiding buying anything with nonusbc ports
Android,not_removed,thats not really a c specific problem as you have the same problem with current microusb and chargers the amps and charging time fluctuate can wildly between different chargers
Android,not_removed,use usb pd its the standard
Android,not_removed,theyve been using usbc for their macbooks for a long time now its shortsighted to flat out assert that iphone wont ever get it
Android,not_removed,you provide literally no reason why these things need to happen or are better
Android,not_removed,you start off with usb c needs to take off for reasons as its fucking useful and then dont list any reasons or why its fucking useful lol
Android,not_removed,if it is usb because usb typec can be mode too
Android,not_removed,type c is just the connector it has nothing to do with speed the protocol or verion does ie usb
Android,not_removed,trust me when you get a usb typec youll never get back to micro
Android,not_removed,its possible to power a monitor with a usb c cable usb c is more than a new cable as it is a revolution look no further than the usb c thunderbolt spec you dont need dongles for usb c as the port itself is enough lg promoted a vr headset powered by usb c
Android,not_removed,just what we need being forced to spend more money on new accessories that do the same thing as the old ones im avoiding usbc as long as i can typec is times faster times in alt mode provides the power completely reversible and can be used for stuff like displayport out external gpus driving a monitor and powering it off the same cable charging laptops etc it is many things but exactly the same is not one of them
Android,not_removed,technology needs to progress if usbc with usb as min standard usb for basic low power devices is implemented across everything we use whats the harm it will solve a lot of our data transfer speed and connectivity problems also it is less prone to breakage of either port or cable since it can be inserted in reverse as well that has been a big problem with micro usb
Android,not_removed,ive already converted one micro usb cable to have usbc on the aside and made a swissknife short chargesync cable ca to cmicro usblightning only cost to me was the worth of usbc adapters
Android,not_removed,i think the volume of phones produced with typec will exceed the volume of phones produced with microusb but yes there will be laggards well still find microusb in years even years im sure somewhere
Android,not_removed,will it actually be more expensive to implement usbc at that point
Android,not_removed,are there even any relatively modern phones with mini usb
Android,not_removed,nah were already seeing phones with typec zte zmax pro coming out tomorrow it might take longer in india and other places that often dont ship with chargers but the cost of typec itself is coming down fast
Android,not_removed,that statement is outrageous few americans get the latest phones every year maybe youre watching too many american tv showscommercials or spending too long on randroid on average not years but much longer than a year and its only getting longer however youre right i shouldve written new phones obviously youll be able to find many phones in with microusb but they wont be new and of course there will be pockets of slow adoption where the main local manufacturer sticks with microusb but im talking globally if we randomly sampled new phone purchases but even now how many new phones do you see with miniusb or proprietary connectors do you see very few i lived in a developing country for a few years only people with yearold phones werent microusb why why did lowend manufacturers waste time implementing the microusb standard why not just make their own charging solution just route with an amp or two and use any plug you want yet from when microusb launched in we saw a massive shift from the highend to the lowend from proprietary connectors to microusb that was only years ago its essentially universal now typec seems like it will have a similar trajectory do you have any reasoning or evidence or even conjecture why typec will not become the most common standard for new phones in
Android,not_removed,typec is times faster times in alt mode provides the power and can be used for stuff like displayport out external gpus driving a monitor and powering it off the same cable charging laptops etc its also cheaper to manufacture as it doesnt require hardware drm
Android,not_removed,usb also has the huge advantage of having analog cababilities ie you can use it as a headphone jack lightning doesnt have this
Android,not_removed,both do the same on different ways usbc has a resistor on both ends which if its the wrong one it makes it to be out of spec meanwhile lightning has a chip that encodesdecodes both have pros and cons but usb is technically simpler and the license is free
Android,not_removed,pcs dont have them or usb because intel decided to not include usb with skylake chipsets uh what usb via typec port you meant to say usb is not included on skylake chipsets but intel offers a standalone chip alpine ridge that has been integrated into plenty of laptops and pcs
Android,not_removed,uh yeah no thats not totally true a lot of motherboards i was shopping around for had usb type c
Android,not_removed,drops this fall 😀
Android,not_removed,they make a notinsignificant portion of money from lightning licensing
Android,not_removed,sure for the cheapest generic stuff they do have that made for iphone certification program for third party accessories and cables that people can look for to ensure that apple has approved it or whatever im sure the usb consortium or whatever has standards for labeling something a certain way or allowing use of the usb logo but thats not as visible to us consumers for whatever reason
Android,not_removed,all the lightning cables and adapters have a tiny chip inside if its not what the device being charged is expecting the user gets a this accessory is not supported error the problem with usbc is oftentimes you dont know if the cablesadapters are built to spec one bad cableadapter and your device gets fried as painfully illustrated by benson leung losing a chromebook thanks to one flybynight outfit wiring the cable completely wrong
Android,not_removed,i mean its not qc in the traditional sense but theres the ability to block chargers accessory not supported cables can technically work without immediately destroying the phone not like the recent issues with usbc chargers where you have to look on benson leungs google find his spreadsheet and reference it when buying chargers and cables
Android,not_removed,it wont charge unless its official itll come up with an error and refuse to charge
Android,not_removed,but only on mac which has to work with pc peripherals not on iphone which is more about accessories designed to directly complement phone not necessarily supplement it for that you need more reliable compatibility but not necessarily high versatility since a lot of it will go to waste
Android,not_removed,currently only on the macbook retina and latestgen apple tv
Android,not_removed,its not entirely specific to usbc but its a lot worse with usbc in practice microusb doesnt really get past the range
Android,not_removed,theyve been using usbc for their macbooks for a long time now it hasnt been that long its on a single device for a year and a half theres not enough to say that apple is going to go all in with usbc or not either way
Android,not_removed,no its not money is what runs them and everyone else they can make a profit by being assholes and using a proprietary port
Android,not_removed,apple will not make a universal cable it is not myopic to know apple wont give up their profit margin
Android,not_removed,if you mean posting links to prove myself then google the shit yourself google the benefits of usb c and get back to me with reasons why this port is bad for android the usb c port has the ability to power peripherals this alone is very useful and provides options for the future imagine paying to for a device that can power an hdtv or music production device usb c thunderbolt already exists and is a thing i refuse to purchase an android smartphone without usb c
Android,not_removed,rereads post and edits
Android,not_removed,this 😊
Android,not_removed,yep there will be plenty of sim locked phones with micro usb sold at convenience stores for years
Android,not_removed,we still have tablets sold with miniusb or some other proprietary connector so yea it wont change much in the mainstream market sure but otherwise
Android,not_removed,true
Android,not_removed,i dont know about phones but i bought a garmin this year that uses mini
Android,not_removed,is that type c usb though thats probably why its cheap is because its only a different header
Android,not_removed,see thats the answer i was looking for i know most of this wont be implemented on smartphone the near future but it proves that it does have better potential than lightning at least on some criteria
Android,not_removed,uh hold on lets clarify this a little and move beyond specification sheets typec is times faster times in alt mode two issues typec must be combined with usb to reach those speeds i doubt any android phone will include usb second so typec when paired with a port is only faster not altmode could be useful some oems are using it already like lg provides the power that wont be able to be used at all phones are barely pushing for charging by the time they can use im sure lightning will have caught up
Android,not_removed,that sounds to me like apple is better off keeping lightning ports then
Android,not_removed,how does that rebutt his point in any way
Android,not_removed,and the physical connector is nicer imo i dont understand why theres still a tiny piece of plastic that can easily be broken in ports these days
Android,not_removed,sure it is people who make cableschargesetc that do not follow spec cannot use the usbif logo its not visible if you dont know about it same as anything else
Android,not_removed,thank you why do people like ufiskerq talk about stuff which they have no idea it takes minutes to google this shit these days
Android,not_removed,theyve added a similar authentication for usb typec devices and cables but yeah it needs to be implemented and when it is they can essentially do the same thing
Android,not_removed,my understanding is that its still bypassed by various knock offs but either case usbc now offers a method of authentication similar to what apple uses
Android,not_removed,dont you think they would want you to easily be able to use the iphone with their own computers even if its a proprietary plug in the iphone the other side of the cable would have to be typec
Android,not_removed,how is it a lot worse when it comes to charging yeah there is the new rapidquickturbowhatever charge at which some chargers dont do but you could say the same about the micro chargers and qc capability and thats not to mention the headache that used to exist with usb chargers and the whole iphone compatibility issues those no longer exist with any decent recently made charger but usb charging has never been that straight forward for anyone that paid attention to charge time thats what you get with a universal connector even with pd charging of laptops its just another flavor of people using their old cellphone wall warts on their tablets and ipads and being surprised at it not charging very fast people have kind of gotten used to just using the charger that came with their device
Android,not_removed,more than a single device actually the apple tv also has a usbc port which replaces the models microusb port you can use that port to connect to macbooks or other pcs but most users will never use it a separate port is used for ac power notably apple tv is an apple device that uses usbc as a client port like phones do rather than a host port even if apple wants to replace with on their products i still have doubts theyll ditch lightning unless either the eu forces them to adopt usb connectors or apple comes up with some advertiseable iphone feature that needs usbc
Android,not_removed,i know that im just saying that since there is a precedent already its rather shortsighted dismiss the possibility of it happening at all
Android,not_removed,ok this discussion is running circles im saying that there already is a precedent where apple stopped using proprietary connectors that they sold at premium price for a standard one sure its unlikely to happen for something as popular as the iphone but its pretty stupid to just say lol no way its absolutely impossible that it ever happens lol apple loves money especially if you consider that the situation is evolving apple is slowly losing market shares as samsung and other android phones get more and more popular in the highend market companies are gonna start to develop more usbc accessories and people are gonna start to complain that they cant use this or that gadget with their iphone currently its the opposite but things never stagnate sure its an unlikely scenario in the close future but its not too farfetched to imagine it possible
Android,not_removed,apple had a profit margin when they could sell proprietary cables for their macbooks now they dont have that anymore its not unfathomable that they could end up going the same route with iphones of course they may not but it wouldnt be surprising if they did
Android,not_removed,this
Android,not_removed,so what by that point of view you would stick with the nokia forever just because switching cables is a mess
Android,not_removed,for now sure when micro usb came out it was also considered to be pointless since mini does the same thing and has a more secure physically stronger connection technology marches on
Android,not_removed,duct tape and silicone shoelaces
Android,not_removed,you own a nexus running marshmallow and your words are factually incorrect httpsenwikipediaorgwikiusbtypecsmartphones
Android,not_removed,is nothing if you want them to cost so little as to be free all you get is failboat that not only doesnt work but also break your shit now if you think frying your phone with a madeinchina adapter is well worth the risk go ahead meanwhile the rest of us arent touching those crap with streetlight poles
Android,not_removed,just like disposable cameras are still sold although everyone has a smartphone
Android,not_removed,thats not as important imo we just need to switch everything to fit type c plugs so all chargers and computers and cars just need type c ports
Android,not_removed,same with the
Android,not_removed,thanks man i almost blew a nerve whew you saved me thank you for your calm advice bahahahaha i just like correcting people on reddit its a weird hobby but man it is incredibly satisfying especially when the other person thinks theyre correcting you lol
Android,not_removed,well lighting was made to make apple more money and be better than the pin
Android,not_removed,usbc can charge laptops and other larger things too which is where power closer to is useful you could use the same cable for your phone and your laptop and thats useful
Android,not_removed,dont worry laptops can handle all that wattage only because they use multiple cells together oppo once claimed to have had a two cell phone in thr works but all references to it were later removed and the replacement batteries clearly indicated they werent two cell
Android,not_removed,they can do whatever they want
Android,not_removed,financially yes
Android,not_removed,his point was that pcs dont have type c while they in fact do have it
Android,not_removed,what chipset would go in those motherboards skylake so therefore it must support to some degree
Android,not_removed,huh have you ever tried using a nonmfilicensed lightning cable its very visible apple gave this a lot of thought mate even with the junk we see with these early shitty usbtype c implementations usb if will never go as far as apple
Android,not_removed,it also only takes minutes to google that these types of protections were cracked mere months after being introducedeg either way that was besides the point fact of the matter remains apple has a certification program as does usbif apple has authentication for their devicescables as does usbif
Android,not_removed,nothing is perfect but apple has given more regard towards cables and authentication than usbif by far its not even close and thats ok typec is supposed to be cheap and plentiful you just need to be a bit careful in these next few months from who you buy from
Android,not_removed,sure and they make typec to lightning cables but it goes to show the differences in the usage of the port on each machine
Android,not_removed,it would surprise me to see apple do anything that lets others sell accessories that actually work with the iphone that bypass their sales channel
Android,not_removed,exactlyyyy
Android,not_removed,well yeah theyre still useful there are some things ie festivals or hiking where you do want a camera but you dont want to take your expensive smartphone nor do you want to be relying on battery life
Android,not_removed,yeah they are nifty party favors
Android,not_removed,yeah universality is key especially if we want usbc to replace laptop chargers and other larger equipment
Android,not_removed,err thats the thing usb typec cables that can sustain are specialized iirc they are active power cables that have specialized hardware to allow them to use no phone imo will include that fancy typec cable if the phone only takes it will work the other way around though your laptop cable can charge your phone but likely you wouldnt want to be moving that cable around a lot because its pretty special
Android,not_removed,and how big would the powerbrick be
Android,not_removed,uhi think youre confused the vast majority of laptops have a bios lock to prevent higher wattage power supplies its not just for the batteries but for the circuitry as well
Android,not_removed,no shit they could go back to pin connectors and still sell millions like nothing
Android,not_removed,er as in every conversation about usb typec were getting confused with the connector and what pins are being used inside the connector some usb typec ports only have the usb and power pins actually enabled the rest for usb and alternate modes are dead
Android,not_removed,it supports traditional usb aka usb if you want the fancy usb via thunderbolt your motherboard should have the alpine ridge chip or if your motherboard is cheaperolder it will use the asmedia but im not sure if it supports
Android,not_removed,you said the motherboards you were looking at had type c and so
Android,not_removed,and apple continually bans more and more of those cables apple has a certification program that is widely used and receives to prevent even more nonmfi cables the vast majority of lightning cables are fully authenticated the vast majority of usb type cables even typec are not authenticated case closed
Android,not_removed,they also make usbc to lightning adapters which sell for a pretty penny
Android,not_removed,yup use them sometimes
Android,not_removed,yeah there are places like brazil
Android,not_removed,ready on
Android,not_removed,ah i assumed that all cables were the same i guess the from the pixel doesnt require such hardware
Android,not_removed,do you happen to know where i can find usbc that can charge at id like to charge my dell xps with it
Android,not_removed,i dont have any dimensions and while yes it is larger than a phone charger the chromebook pixel charger doesnt look like its too huge
Android,not_removed,well the practical limits of charging rates are higher for laptops than they are for single cell phones thats all i mean
Android,not_removed,while thats true most pcs with usbc support usb its common to have an external usb controller for that
Android,not_removed,but you can still use a usb c plug right isnt that the point
Android,not_removed,if that is the case how can it have gbps transfer rates as gen is only
Android,not_removed,that wasnt me but these motherboards support usb type c with gen this is an example of one
Android,not_removed,so nothing prevents apple from doing the same with usbc the comment i was responding to was that apple could force quality control on lightning accessories fact of the matter is that both connectors are equally capable of what the poster suggested
Android,not_removed,likely but not sure until someone opens up the cable i think is the maximum allowed with unmarked cables but that doesnt mean every unmarked cable can actually handle
Android,not_removed,err ive only seen one consumer device that supports usbc and its a motherboard if its actually using the power profile i hope they included one ive not one seen for sale ever is it not that is the normal size for typec charging in laptops
Android,not_removed,that would still be really big for a allinone charger wouldnt want to carry that thing around although the technology is getting better a small powerbrick could potentially melt if i was to charge my demanding laptop with it im not trusting this yet maybe in the future
Android,not_removed,external usb controller sure but thats not the word i would use necessarily its just a little ic chip thats tucked onto the motherboard like the other ic chips that nobody even knows about
Android,not_removed,oh whoops i replied to the wrong person i meant to reply to umrreddituser he equated usb typec to usb saying it was a chipset limitation but its not youre exactly right you just need the port
Android,not_removed,err hold on how can what some motherboards are usb some motherboards are usb the skylake chipset by itself only offers usb ie where have you read that the skylake pch offers
Android,not_removed,alright thanks for clearing that up
Android,not_removed,you should check out vhf chargers some mit grad students figured out how to make chargers very small theyll be going big in the next years i imagine httpswwwgozoltcom httpfinsixcomdart i think lenovo is the first major oem to use vhf chargers but i imagine itll be the new premium laptop charging solution
Android,not_removed,true i dont have a laptop but i thought that throwing a phone charger or this charger in a bag wouldnt make much of a diffenrence youre right on the power draw though didnt know laptop chargers could use so much
Android,not_removed,im talking about the motherboards with usb gen if the port can do gbps wouldnt that mean the cpu can handle that throughput what does the alpine ridge chip do now i have so many questions time to do some googling
Android,not_removed,totes np the more we know the better decisions we consumers can make
Android,not_removed,oh sorry i see what you mean the physical typec port can do to it depends on what pins are connected if only the usb pins are connected then its then its then skylakes chipset motherboard does not offer the port however it has a theoretical max of combined from sata and usb so definitely enough for of it just doesnt have the appropriate pins to connect the motherboard to the port you need an additional chip that accepts dataand then sends it to skylakes chipset pch the additional chip is either intels alpine ridge controller or asmedias chip those extra chips allow the motherboard to accept a port input without those chips you just get the built in features of skylake which only handle
Android,not_removed,thank you so much for replying thats very informative so from doing some searching it looks like the alpine ridge chipset can do gbps through thunderbolt and intel cpus wont natively support usb gen until kaby lake next year
Android,not_removed,no worries yes you got it d kaby lake should have native usb oh yeah i forgot to say that yeah alpine ridge is actually a chip but i think is the main way intel motherboards will get
Android,not_removed,we dont need a thread for every phone we already know you can build lineage from source also what does preofficial even mean its either official or unofficial

Android,not_removed,my man just checked for an update and sure enough there it was downloading right now 😀
Android,not_removed,and they said motos are one of the firsts to get updates
Android,not_removed,i hope it doesnt have all the problems the plus had in india with the nougat update low battery life low notification volume phone hanging etc that i read on the forums
Android,not_removed,got the update two weeks ago in turkey
Android,not_removed,better late than never i guess
Android,not_removed,moto play when i bought it when my bootlooped and used it until i got a replacement now my coworkers just died after his second replacement hes using it now would love to get nougat on there
Android,not_removed,got it this morning on my unlocked
Android,not_removed,how is it
Android,not_removed,use to be the case until lenovo bought them
Android,not_removed,seriously pretty much all of last years mid range phones are on nougat wth motorola s
Android,not_removed,a few years ago yes these days no
Android,not_removed,my mothers moto have the nougat for ages now it was before my z play got it
Android,not_removed,got nougat weeks ago belgium reteu my battery life took a hit but after a reset there werent any other problems
Android,not_removed,no its real i got the update
Android,not_removed,excellent so far nova launcher is snappier in nougat compared to marshmallow which is a welcome surprise the multiwindow improved ability to reply to messages through the notification shade bloody useful took a while to arrive but im glad its here
Android,not_removed,thanks thats good to know i read all kind of problems on nougat on lenovos own plus forum
Android,not_removed,thanks you meant you had to do a factory reset wiped out everything and reinstalled reconfigured all apps im going to skip the update
Android,not_removed,gotta give it up for topjohnwu safetynet and faking the knox status while offering root a systemless interface and an sexy app to manage it all i can play pokemon go use snapchat android pay while getting rid of unwanted bloat im gonna leave this here httptopjohnwugithubiodonate
Android,not_removed,edit updated magisk manager flashed the zip and all working fine on then i enabled only the core functionality because i dont use the modules everything went well move most binaries into magiskimg samsung cannot run su daemon in data move sepolicy live patch to latestart service this shall fix the long boot times especially on samsung devices add samsung rkp hexpatch back should now work on samsung stock kernels fix installation with supersu support other logcat amprocstart patterns change sysfsselinuxenforcepolicy permissions if required samsung devices cannot switch selinux states if running on permissive custom kernel the users will stuck at permissive if this scenario is detected change permissions to hide the permissive state leads to safetynet passes add built in prop rules to fake knox status samsung apps requiring knox status to be should now work samsung pay not tested remove all robuild props since they cause more issues than they benefit add legacy format support most linux kernel using for compression is using this fix mtk kernels with mtk headers
Android,not_removed,whats magisk
Android,not_removed,since upgrading to my phone is randomly losing root access rooted with magisksu and i have to reboot to get it back stopped working too dae have this problem im on nexus forgot the exact version
Android,not_removed,sorry if this is dumb question but can i play pokemon go with magisk installed
Android,not_removed,do i need to flash the magisk zip every time i update lineage os or is there a workaround
Android,not_removed,new to this and i followed the tutorial on the oneplus sidebar to root but now after updating i cant pass the safety net check and my magisk is enabled what can i do to fix it
Android,not_removed,not the most tech savvy android user here but will installing this void my samsung warranty by tripping knox
Android,not_removed,i get an installation error on my nexus
Android,not_removed,might not be the place to post it but this post raised some questions so i accidentally logged out of snapchat couple of weeks ago and couldnt get back in because of safetynet and supersu i tried disabling supersu to login to snapchat again but it didnt work works for some apps i use after googling and browsing for a while i installed magisk to try to login again i flashed the zip in twrp and installed the magisk manager disabled supersu and i could log in again since then i havent logged out of snapchat again so im not sure if it works still but reading all these comments i get the impression that i went about it the wrong way and should have uninstalled supersu completely then flashed magisk and not bother with supersu at all phone htc one on marshmallow with stock rom and elementalx kernel
Android,not_removed,will this support my edge on the rom the previous versions mess up my root
Android,not_removed,i cant wait till pixel support is added but until then unrooted isnt too bad
Android,not_removed,does this only work with xposed getting error installing stock note rooted
Android,not_removed,ive been running since release and im somewhat reluctant to update why because everything works the way i want it to theres not really any modules out there that interest me so i just use it for su and suhide when my bank app and rootrestricted apps work why mess with a good thing
Android,not_removed,anyone know where to get the checksum for the magisk file download
Android,not_removed,can someone explain to me what is magisk
Android,not_removed,is it possible to hide magisk manager from the apps screen remove the visibilityicon of its precence on a device like supersu
Android,not_removed,any ideas what i can do i just tried to root using magisk but now ive just found out that the update is not avalible on the play store where do i go from here
Android,not_removed,whats the advantage of magisk over supersu or cm built in root
Android,not_removed,i just installed magisk and passing safety net and all but how do i get it to fake the knox status as i would like to setup to use samsung pay thank you
Android,not_removed,magisk rocks in general i feel like were in a golden age of android development
Android,not_removed,how easy is this to install i just downgraded from android o back to a stable n and i am stock with an unlocked bootloader i want to use android pay version of installing
Android,not_removed,does samsung pay work now that knox is hidden
Android,not_removed,off topic how do i update it just head to the app and update or uninstall using zip in thread and reinstall
Android,not_removed,sosince ive no modules and im not planning to use them now i can safely check the core only box
Android,not_removed,systemless root solution with systemless mods support like systemless or systemless xposed
Android,not_removed,disable busybox it happened to me on only one time after that its been flawless
Android,not_removed,ive been having this since magisk started to have its own root built in instead of phhs i never found a fix
Android,not_removed,yes from an unrooted device install magisk manager flash magisk zip check you have root go to mm settings and enable magisk hide
Android,not_removed,use to reflash magisk after you update los
Android,not_removed,you need to unroot first because magisk has its own root builtin magisksu now it can work with supersu but its recommended to just use magisksu as its more compatible so unroot by reflashing your stock firmware you dont have to wipe just dirty flash then just flash magisksu then open magisk manager and enable magisk hide from the settings after enabling magisk hide you should pass safteynet
Android,not_removed,magisk itself wont but you need to install twrp first that will trip knox read the warnings
Android,not_removed,whats the error
Android,not_removed,snapchat only checks if the phone is rooted at login sounds like your good
Android,not_removed,you have to ask the rom developer for that
Android,not_removed,has nothing to do with xposed
Android,not_removed,i take a twrp backup before every update its a good reminder to take frequent backups
Android,not_removed,its a toolframework to root your device and also install various mods etc without actually touching your system partition for eg you could install a blacktheme version of your system apps install adblocking hosts file etc all without modifying system as a result you could apply ota updates without any issues since your system hasnt been modified magisk also has a bunch of useful features such as being able to hide itself from various rootdetection methods used by google safteynet and banking apps basically magisk solves two of the biggest drawbacks of rooting ie not being able to apply ota updates and not being able to use apps which detect root like pokemon go now you can root and play pokemon go and use your banking apps and apply system updates etc
Android,not_removed,you can download the apk directly from the magisk website just visit on your droid
Android,not_removed,the ability to hide it and unlike supersu it even respects licenses and is open source
Android,not_removed,other apps cant detect it so they run like business as usual android pay snap pokemon banking apps
Android,not_removed,samsung pay still not working it shows device been modified any help please
Android,not_removed,id love to agree with you but wheres my xposed all i want is youtube background playback but noooo that costs a month either that or i have to deal with the jank alternatives magisk is fucking awesome though and id love to see xposed being installed though it soon
Android,not_removed,just flash and install the magisk manager app from the play store to hide rootmagisk you need to be fully unrooted too so it defaults to the builtin root that is capable of hiding this so unroot flash zip install app profit explore the apps settings because it doesnt assume anything
Android,not_removed,can you downgrade from o to n without a wipe i got to o in the first place by flashing on top of n without wiping but i want to go back and dont want to start from scratch
Android,not_removed,just install through the app then reboot your device
Android,not_removed,correct
Android,not_removed,not to be rude but whats the point of it
Android,not_removed,thank you it worked for me
Android,not_removed,on the guide it says to also use phhs superuser app do i not really need that app anymore its there and sometimes its not during in the guide from the wiki
Android,not_removed,thank you
Android,not_removed,httpimgurcomavdzmz this is the error that i get flashing the zip file doesnt work on twrp either
Android,not_removed,sigh still no magisk support i guess
Android,not_removed,meh i cant be bothered i have an old backup handy if i royally fuck something up its not the end of the world to me if i had to factory reset my phone with google backup most of the pain is taken away now thankfully
Android,not_removed,thank you
Android,not_removed,thanks dude got it sorted anyway
Android,not_removed,how supersu doesnt respect licenses
Android,not_removed,just use ogyoutube or iytbp
Android,not_removed,the jank alternative is called lucky patcher and it works without a hitch the whole process takes maybe minutes
Android,not_removed,had systemless supersu installed installed the magisk manager flashed zip from the app rebooted checked magisk hide and systemless hosts for adaway disabled debugging now i have root and pass safetynet with substratum and all my root apps running perfectly running pheonix aosp aex on this is frigging awesome im glad the selinux problems and supersu install issues were sorted
Android,not_removed,wait so i need to first unroot the supersu app that i currently have
Android,not_removed,i had to wipe when coming back from o unfortunately
Android,not_removed,any update
Android,not_removed,even if im rooted with magisk
Android,not_removed,thanks just another question about magisk if you can help me i use adaway and it works but i noticed that systemless hosts box is unchecked do i need to enable it
Android,not_removed,when everything is systemless its easier to flash otas no need to re flash the rom its also easier to fool safetynet systemless is the default root method now with magisk or supersu
Android,not_removed,whats the error in twrp and are you running the stock rom or a custom rom
Android,not_removed,just remove any existing root first flash unsu zip then flash magisk magisk includes lots of fixes for samsung devices and people have reported it works fine with the stock rom im not familiar with but if you unsu first then you shouldnt have any issues with magisk magisk has its own su btw which is recommended over other su methods
Android,not_removed,i think they mean xposed on n
Android,not_removed,what exactly is safetynet for
Android,not_removed,ooo this looks nice in fact this is exactly what i want no need for xposed for me no more however i would like to see xposed still get some development for those poor souls having to deal with samsungs shitty ui
Android,not_removed,can lucky patcher be installed after patching youtube
Android,not_removed,i finally did it thanks but after all that i see the iytpb xda post has this all prepatched and much less jank this took me several tries and doesnt even block the ads completely
Android,not_removed,the confusing part is related to root magisk has its own root method and the magisk manager app manages root permissions just like supersu but its also compatible with other root methods it just disables its own root tools if youre already rooted when you flash magisk it wont apply its own root method magisk root is necessary to hide root and hide magisk though hiding them lets you pass safetynet in turn letting you use android pay if any trace of supersu for instance is left you wont get magisk root and uninstall the supersu app too i dont think thatll affect magisk root but you wont need it nor do you want different apps managing root permissions
Android,not_removed,had to wipe i assume you tried doing it without wiping first then and it didnt work
Android,not_removed,if youre rooted with an earlier version of magisk preferably you already have the magisk manager app so yes
Android,not_removed,nope since magisk already mounts the hosts file systemless there is no need for adaway to support it explicitly
Android,not_removed,i run custom rom pure nexus magisk was installed without any issue i must check out the error in twrp when i got home dont want to mess with my phone on the go
Android,not_removed,i will get error in twrp
Android,not_removed,oh i see is a nougat based rom does magisk have support with nougat also where is the link for magisk please
Android,not_removed,also i forgot to mention root checker identifies it as a pixel xl
Android,not_removed,unfortunately when flashing in twrp it shows that you have to flash supersu to finish installation looks like i have to reflash
Android,not_removed,hope he doesnt burn out from people asking when it will work with n and then o
Android,not_removed,therein lies the problem by the time xposed comes out for n o will be out for most users
Android,not_removed,tool that can be used by apps in order to check for rooted devices like android pay
Android,not_removed,uninstalled yes kind of but then it will need to be reinstalled every reboot also every update will require a reinstallation and repatching through lucky patcher
Android,not_removed,iytpb whats that googling doesnt come up with anything
Android,not_removed,samsung pay checks knox instead of safetynet so it still might not work it depends if pay authenticates with knox or simply checks the flag
Android,not_removed,perfect thanks
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,ive never done it but it suppose to
Android,not_removed,usually you have to reflash the stock recovery prior to taking ota with systemless root but given system partition never mounted rw and depending on device security status twrp can even flash the ota package entirely or just rom boot image updates then just reflash custom recovery and magisk
Android,not_removed,if you install flashfire then you can flash otas directly from your os while preserving root regardless of whether or not youve got magisk but magisk makes root more useful and the chances of successful ota increases because youd be using mods which do not touch your system partition
Android,not_removed,i know i definitely would have a long time ago
Android,not_removed,once xposed for n is out converting it to o probably wont take nearly as long the main struggle​ with developing xposed for n is the dual jitaot compilation system
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,does flashfire finally work with magisks version of superuser its been a long time since i tried but i was under the impression that flashfire was useless when using magisk id be happy to be proven wrong
Android,not_removed,nearly as long i think if xposed isnt released soon for n it will be abandoned for o then someone new will rewrite the whole project to make it even better than before
Android,not_removed,expect the next robin to have an rgb indicator light rgb physicalcapacitive buttons rgb speakers rgb fingerprint scanner and rgb slideout keyboard
Android,not_removed,important note from nextbit will operate as an independent division inside razer focused on unique mobile design and experiences to put it simply well be doing exactly what weve been doing all along only bigger and better so no rgb phones anytime soon unless nextbit really wants to
Android,not_removed,i know some of you guys might not be down for this but im excited for nextbit theres no way they could have continued to compete with one plus and others selling budget phones while samsung and lg are hitting the high end hard razer is supposed to be a pretty awesome company and im pretty excited for what they can do with the nextbit brand
Android,not_removed,good news for the nextbit guys i suppose i hope razers shoddy quality control and terrible customer service dont bleed over into the phone production
Android,not_removed,rgb jokes aside although i think that would be pretty cool this is interesting razer makes really high end hardware both their computer peripherals as well with their blade lineup of laptops while nextbit made lower end hardware im assuming if razer is going to make phones theyll be completely different than phones like the nextbit robin and likely priced much higher as well
Android,not_removed,also
Android,not_removed,people like to make jokes about how fitbit is going to buy out all the indie smartwatch companies razer might buy out all the small companies that use android on their devices that arent smartwatches
Android,not_removed,hopefully razer makes them put a micro sd card in thier next phone
Android,not_removed,now its gonna cost like dollars because razer
Android,not_removed,with what razor has done this should be a good fit
Android,not_removed,rip razer over the years ive used them have gone from being completely about quality to being about quantity with the same price point my only pc peripherals to just go out on me and break are razers stuff in the last years never ever again razer
Android,not_removed,this is interesting i look forward to seeing what they do with this do we have any expectation as to when there will be product news related to this acquisition
Android,not_removed,honestly this is kind of awesome
Android,not_removed,lots of leds power and no battery lol
Android,not_removed,rip build quality
Android,not_removed,one more to the incredible journey collection
Android,not_removed,that sounds very interesting nextbit please think about the rgb possibilities so say an rgb variant also how about official oms support or even better substratum i really hope you release a new phone this year with the 🤞
Android,not_removed,hopefully phones will come with fl studio as bloatware
Android,not_removed,in seriousness though what does this mean for nextbit
Android,not_removed,i really hope they stay in the midrange for phones if they do continue to make them
Android,not_removed,i guess its a good fit nextbit makes poorly designed weak plastic phones a child can snap in half razer is a great match d
Android,not_removed,ill be waiting for the slide out triple monitor phone
Android,not_removed,nothing involving razer is exciting nor is it a promise of good support or reliability
Android,not_removed,how is razers reliability with its computers this may not be the place to ask but as someone thats looking at an mbp an xps and the razer stealth whichever is most like an ultrabook im a bit skeptical of a gaming machine i dont game but im compensating for having a mbp with a core duo so i can afford maxing out the specs will the razer last me even half as long as the seven years my mbp has though
Android,not_removed,for some reason i really like the robins physical look i think its the squared off edges all around it one in black would be cool
Android,not_removed,sixteen point nine million colour pixels hype s
Android,not_removed,im honestly surprised razer hasnt entered the smartphone market already all they have to do is put out a super premium phone and the money will be rolling in for them
Android,not_removed,dont see the link between the two honestly unless nextbit needed a bailout and razor was the only willing buyer
Android,not_removed,we dont need anymore leds please thank you
Android,not_removed,razernextbitplease remember that if you dont release a verizon compatible cdma phone youve lost out on a lot of the high end large cities market fact is only verizon gives strong signal in brickstone buildings in nyc i know its the same way in seattle and ive heard its similar in san francisco i pay as do all of my coworkers well over a month for verizon because well get no signal with tmobile so we have the money for a superior phone but it must be verizon compatible im still using my old nexus and im looking for a new cdma phone i would love for my new phone to be a nextbit dont forget about us
Android,not_removed,how is that exciting an overpriced phone that overheats and has crappy internals
Android,not_removed,next thing you know and razer going to name it darth vader and give out the cloud space as luke skycloud walker
Android,not_removed,with cherry red power and volume switches
Android,not_removed,gotta beat corsair to the rgb phone
Android,not_removed,rgb screen too xd
Android,not_removed,dont forget overpriced and underwhelming sturdiness
Android,not_removed,not gonna lie i kinda want that
Android,not_removed,slide out dual monitors
Android,not_removed,dont forget shit software
Android,not_removed,not rbg chroma
Android,not_removed,the nexbit rgbin
Android,not_removed,httpimgurcomnabbswrpng
Android,not_removed,and rgb slideout keyboard please i want that
Android,not_removed,plot twist there will be no next robin just razer blade mobile
Android,not_removed,razer is garbage but if they put a keyboard on a smartphone id begrudgingly buy it i love physical keyboards slightly more than i hate razer for being the beats headphones of the peripherals world
Android,not_removed,and to expect it to be fuck all expensive
Android,not_removed,cant wait for that slide out track pad
Android,not_removed,honestly that sounds awesome
Android,not_removed,apart from rgb everywhere expect the next robin also support the razer core via usbc thunderbolt good luck playing games on a inch screen
Android,not_removed,and the whole package for tiny hands
Android,not_removed,and rgb slideout keyboard im in
Android,not_removed,i want to see a robin with httpimgurcomdrppwbg option
Android,not_removed,excellent i was worried theyd go under the robin was a promising start im glad they have a chance follow it up and with the backing of the razer behemoth behind them good news
Android,not_removed,no rgb no buy
Android,not_removed,important to note that razer is under no legal obligation to adhere to this
Android,not_removed,thanks really appreciate it
Android,not_removed,razer is supposed to be a pretty awesome company heh i suggest you go look at their one already existing android tv device the razer forge tv check out what users on their own forums think
Android,not_removed,nextbit looks promising but im not on board with the cloud thing
Android,not_removed,i suggested my sister in law buy razer blade laptop based on their reputation it bootlooped in days they wouldnt take it back since it was past their day return window only would give store credit she had to do a credit card charge back after a month of arguing i know its only one case but i know ill never buy razer hardware again
Android,not_removed,they used to be an awesome company putting out top notch products now they turn out the same stuff at not even half of the quality but still all of the price
Android,not_removed,i get the feeling that theyre going to go after oneplus expect flagship phones with the same surprise surprise fhd or qhd amoled displays
Android,not_removed,rgb
Android,not_removed,wouldnt that be against their whole cloud storage bit
Android,not_removed,their only other experience with android was with the forge tv they flat out ruined with neglect they launched it with a ton of bugs took forever to fix some of them and never got around to adding netflix all of the cool advertised features never made it to market they made returns difficult ie didnt take them and silently removed it from the market there was no communication the entire life of the product a razer smartphone scares the shit out of me
Android,not_removed,the robin wasnt that sturdy to begin with
Android,not_removed,next note in the making
Android,not_removed,it means they have more money to throw at stuff other than that not much
Android,not_removed,no link necessary any company can buy whatever other company it wants if it has the money and they both agree to the sale or theres a hostile takeover the two dont have to be similar companies
Android,not_removed,not true at all i get a good signal from tmobile almost anywhere in the city from brownstones to stonewalled armories
Android,not_removed,that has nothing to do with the protocol and everything to do with the wavelength
Android,not_removed,so like every other high end phone
Android,not_removed,i paid for mine with its stats it couldve been more
Android,not_removed,nah razer doesnt use cherry mx switches they used to use kailh switches but moved onto making their own imo theyre not as good as cherry mx but i guess if you really like their rgb stuff theyre okay
Android,not_removed,not cherry bad knockoffs that they claim are better than cherry switches for the record some knockoffs like gateron actually are better than cherry but the ones razer uses are awful
Android,not_removed,dont forget the unnecessary software that doesnt really do anything but the updates annoy you every other week
Android,not_removed,nah display showing temperature at the warmest end
Android,not_removed,about of every smartphone is rgb anyways the screen why not
Android,not_removed,and shit build quality and shit support and shitty design that leads to widespread issues in their userbase thus leading to a need for support that is not there learned my lesson and got the fuck out without being burned too badly luckily
Android,not_removed,maybe theyll make you sign into a razer account to charge it
Android,not_removed,no thunderbolt if it doesnt run on an intel cpu next robin running on an confirmed
Android,not_removed,important to note that they might be if its in contract and if its not razer will still do whats in its best interest which is probably letting the phone company make phones
Android,not_removed,you guys are awesome i love your design and the software innovation is awesome keep up the great work also do you plan on making any high end phones or are you sticking with the midrange
Android,not_removed,the forge tv is basically the ouya right kinda doomed to failure there
Android,not_removed,did they offer to replace the device while two weeks isnt that long of a return window on such an expensive product theyre not really under any obligation to allow you to return it manufacturers of complex electronic devices are bound to ship a couple duds and as long as they replace them theyre not doing anything wrong
Android,not_removed,very good move you cannot tango with apple and samsung but the middle ground has plenty of give
Android,not_removed,ahahahaha he probably means expensive not built to last
Android,not_removed,preach their quality has gone to absolute shit for peripherals these past few years
Android,not_removed,yeah the little lights that can change color theyre called rgb which stands for red green and blue by mixing those colors you can make virtually any color for example if you want purple turn the blue and red lights on but leave the green parts off for different shades of purple make the blue or red brighter or dimmer razer is known for adding rgb lights to everything they can they were the first if not then one of the first to add rgb to keyboards mice and even mousepads
Android,not_removed,but you know whats more awesome than having to upload and download everything everytime you want to use or view it having that and having the option to keep it stored locally on a cheap high capacity upgradable and fast medium like sd cards
Android,not_removed,razer
Android,not_removed,obviously but the question is why would razer want to buy nextbit
Android,not_removed,hes not saying its illegal hes saying based on razers previous businesses its odd that they would go after a smartphone manufacturer
Android,not_removed,im not sure if its the cdma or its the fact that verizon has a lock on the bands that are good at going through buildings actually the latter is probably the reason but its well known that in nyc verizon has the best signal and the best ability for that signal to go through walls i heard that tmobile bought a band from verizon a couple of years ago but that only the newest phones had the specific antenna to pick it up
Android,not_removed,well what phone are you using the last phone i had on tmobile was my iphone plus and that had garbage reception inside take one step outsideits super fast inside nada though i have noticed that my friends iphone on tmobile is getting bars inside my work building
Android,not_removed,the more research i do the more correct you are unfortunately verizon owns most of those lower wavelengths though there was a government forced sale of one to tmobile a couple of years ago
Android,not_removed,no this time with a razer logo
Android,not_removed,i havent had a razer device in years i was just going for an over the top feature looking at the nabu i could see them forgetting something small like a modem
Android,not_removed,yeah but the corsair strafe comes with fantastic rgb lighting a very powerful macro system and cherry switches
Android,not_removed,razer have previously used cherry mx blue and brown switches on blackwidow boards
Android,not_removed,i like razer ones more
Android,not_removed,im a cherry blue kinda guy but testing out razers keyboards at a store i think i might like their green switches better they feel slightly smoother while still having the tactile clickyness that said their stuff tends to look nice but break quickly so im not sure whether id shell out for it
Android,not_removed,how do their own switches compare
Android,not_removed,rekt
Android,not_removed,you have the option on some boards they brought that back like a year and half ago
Android,not_removed,this this is so annoying so far my only complaint on my razer peripherals also the keyboard lighting not stopping once i shut my computer down
Android,not_removed,i like the way you think
Android,not_removed,ive had a fantastic experience with my two razer products theyve lasted for well over years which is reasonable for me
Android,not_removed,nah it wasnt doomed to failure it could have been good nothing wrong with the hw its that razer just completely dropped the ball in terms of software and support it doesnt even play netflix lol its the only android tv box that doesnt they also purposefully stripped out adoptable storage from android when they released that for the forge tv and funny you mention ouya razer bought them and integrated ouya software into the forge tv its just another store to buy games is all lol also that might be what you were referencing to now that i think about it it should have been at the very least an android tv box comparable to the nexus box but its miles and miles behind those simply because of razer themselves
Android,not_removed,they offered to replace with a refurbished one which is bs for a laptop
Android,not_removed,imo there are just too many generic flagshipcompetitors it might be better if they made a model and a model
Android,not_removed,ive had a blackwidow ultimate for years now and its still one of my best purchases my taipan and kraken have also served very well
Android,not_removed,my deathadder will be years old this spring its the only mouse ive owned over that time with tens of thousands of hours of gaming and reddit its literally the best purchase i made only the pc case is also still standing
Android,not_removed,theyve certainly had their ups and downs with certain products but my experienced with razer has mostly been overwhelmingly positive used a razer lycosa for like years until the third time i spilled a cup of soda into it and some managed to get past the keys into the keyboard circuitry now i use deathstalker which is by far the most comfortable keyboard ive used at work i use an apple keyboard also have a ms designer keyboard at home for tv usage lots of people recommended logitech keyboards over the years so i tried a few of themsome of the high end g series with screens and a solar powered one and whilst they certainly worked as they should i actually actively hated the materials their keyboards are made ofwhich really surprised me and i never got used to the key spacing travel or click also i think razer tends look a whole lot better than most of the other gaming peripherals as long as it works its just a matter of taste though been using a razer mamba since they came outcurrently use it at work and whilst the battery only lasts for half a day after many years of heavy use its still flawless in wired modenewer models use aa batteries i think mine uses a proprietary battery thats hard to replace i might pick up a logitech mx master mouse for work sometime really nice piece of hardware but only if my mamba dies at home i use a razer naga which is easily my favourite computer accessory stylish functional comfortable and cant play wowdota without it anymore the one purchase i do regret making is the razer megalodon comfy as hell but surround didnt work as well as the sound blasters i owned at the time also i managed to rip the cable to shred because they were so comfy i forgot they were on so now i only use headset with user replaceable cables
Android,not_removed,didnt know about the later part thank you
Android,not_removed,razer wants to be the king of peripherals imagine if they could make a smartphone that worked with all there other stuff
Android,not_removed,to expand their product line to other devices they currently arent making or based on another report i read saying that nextbit will operate independently under the razor roof just to bring in more money from a subsidiary company
Android,not_removed,i know i didnt say he thought it was illegal im saying that the two companies dont have to be similar in what products they make or type of business they conduct in order for one to want to buy the other it seemed like ungrenjie was assuming that since razor makes computers and nextbit makes phones that the only reason razor would want to buy nextbit is because nextbit sold themselves off for cheap cause they were struggling and im saying that thats not necessarily the case he seems to be under the impression that for example only a phone company would want to buy another phone company and im simply stating that isnt always the case sometimes a company will buy another just to have another stream of income and they just keep letting the company do what it was already doing which nextbit has stated is the case here its called diversifying your assets
Android,not_removed,nexus
Android,not_removed,why exactly are cherry switches of a particular flavor an over the top feature
Android,not_removed,ill still wont buy razer products they are over priced for what they are when i can go get a non rbg cherry mx keyboard for quiet a bit less from another brand like ducky and know the keyboard will last
Android,not_removed,rated for a higher number of key presses than cherry switches any claims of quality from razer are invalid every single razer thing i ever owned fool me i know has failed catastrophically within or shortly after the warranty period true story in years time i had razer mice and keyboards the pair being a warranty replacement for the first pair when they all went to shit the time around i got myself a cm quickfire tk with cherry blue and a logitech and here we are about years later and absolutely no signs of trouble to date also had a razer headset that my friends tell me the mic sounded like ass to begin with and eventually one of the speakers took a dump also after about years using sennheiser game one now
Android,not_removed,at ces cherry was giving out earplugs to be snarky i got a pair httpiimgurcomtcukktljpg
Android,not_removed,didnt know that razer staff did witchcraft
Android,not_removed,greetech is another one thats also making razer switches
Android,not_removed,not sure why youre getting downvoted for sharing your experience i have a razer blackwidow and deathadder and theyve been going strong for a couple of years now with no problems
Android,not_removed,apple does the same thing with iphones it sucks but its not only razer
Android,not_removed,thats one of their few good products and you got the last good one yours has cherry switches recent ones do not
Android,not_removed,i remember buying a lachesis mouse from razer almost years ago it was absolutely unusable due to the sensor being a pos that would jump all over the place especially under gaming conditions it was a steaming pile of crap watch this shit
Android,not_removed,sorry i should have been more specific their really high end hardware notebook lines tend to be the most problematic
Android,not_removed,my abyssus has lasted me years so far and ive put this mouse through hell the only reason my deathstalker keyboard broke is because i was too hard on it not because razer has shit quality products
Android,not_removed,i think he understands that its possible for a company to purchase another company that makes unrelated products but often a company will buy another company because they stand to gain in some way from either the business or the technology
Android,not_removed,thats what i meant companies usually acquire other companies which benefit them in some strategic manner like fitbit acquiring pebble because they want to enter the smart watch market whats the benefit of a phone company to a laptop manufacturer if they dont intend to make use of some of their tech or expertise or enter the smartphone market themselves
Android,not_removed,on a phone
Android,not_removed,i think theyre talking about the razer blade pro when it comes to reliability ive had a deathadder and still use it to this day
Android,not_removed,my dream keyboard would be rgb with cherry blues and tenkeyless
Android,not_removed,you know you can turn vertical sensing off right i think mines on but in any case my taipan has been perfect sitting on my goliathus mat for several years
Android,not_removed,could you elaborate on this ive never experienced one of the blades but i know that the staff at linustechtips uses razer blades and linus sebastian himself has given his thumbs up for a few years now that being said thats not for the razer blade pro models
Android,not_removed,considering cherry doesnt make switches for phones whereas rgbing everything is a possibility i assumed you were just calling out general over the top features of razer products
Android,not_removed,razer has one or two anchor products that keep them barely relevant a lot of new products that released in the last years have been horrible and their rmawarranty supports primary objective seems to be inconvenience
Android,not_removed,cooler master masterkeys pro s
Android,not_removed,that video didnt demonstrate the other huge problem with the original lachesis sensor when moving the mouse at gaminglevel velocities it would literally jump by maybe pixels in the opposite direction that had nothing to do with vertical sensing
Android,not_removed,come to think of it using the htc as a visual making the antenna plastic bands translucent and using notification leds in them would be neat
Android,not_removed,now i want that the glass back section on my pixel pulsing and fading for notifications
Android,not_removed,would upgrade currently the notification light on the pixel is subpar
Android,not_removed,definitely
Android,not_removed,every pixel device needs a lightbar a lightbar on a phone would be epic
Android,not_removed,for the price of the phone sure but those photos arent that great
Android,not_removed,that first photo made me think you were trolling
Android,not_removed,i wasnt happy with the camera all that much it was one of the weakest points of the device other than the screen in daylight that being said the phone overall was a good device for the price of not the they started out asking for
Android,not_removed,especially the first one
Android,not_removed,mines still going strong got it in july battery life isnt quite as good on marshmallow compared to kitkat but thats to be expected since it hasnt had quite as many patches
Android,not_removed,i dont think the phone is bad but their customer service is pretty hit or miss it seems
Android,not_removed,the dev support for the opo is unbelievable
Android,not_removed,the opo gets so much love cuz it was the de facto nexus device of its year the actual nexus was priced out of most peoples reach
Android,not_removed,i bought mine a month ago and im impressed by it despite being relatively old
Android,not_removed,i passed my oneplus one to my brother and it runs really smooth still maybe even better then my nexus
Android,not_removed,ive had mine for a while now and if i could trade in my opo for a new updated version instead of getting a new phone i likely would everything about it is super comfortable might be alright but unless its pretty much a i dont think ill be getting one when i do need a new phone which might be a while still butterfingers pending i probably jump back to the nexus line
Android,not_removed,i still miss and its hour sot
Android,not_removed,completely true my oneplus one is still awesome
Android,not_removed,my gripe with older phones is network compatibility
Android,not_removed,all this talk about updating has me scared to update my the was a battery champ updates also made my moto x die prematurely im hoping there more aggressive doze helps
Android,not_removed,they dont even have a stable build of marshmallow on the oneplus yet do they if oneplus wants to differentiate themselves from the competition they need to offer more than years worth of software support on their products and they need to update their devices in a timely manner hell even the galaxy has marshmallow oneplus needs to give people reasons to choose them over the big players in the market and they need to have more than just price as the differentiator
Android,not_removed,the opo was great unless you were on tmobile since it lacked band lte only had it was great on att before that though if the has good band support and nfc id pick one up i use android pay quite a bit and more smaller places i frequent are accepting nfc payments easy to do with squares new emvnfc reader which most ipadsquare merchants have started using
Android,not_removed,changing my rom from cm to aosp based gave me a much better battery life you can try it out
Android,not_removed,ive been on sultan with root and the forced doze app no other battery tweak or kernel getting about same sot and standby performance as same usage pattern as before
Android,not_removed,it stops me from ordering another one plus products i dont want to play the roulette for a working new device
Android,not_removed,i just remember having to wait about months for a replacement phone after i was initially promised a rma for the touch issues on my first device they took away the phone with airmail fedex really quickly then support just disappeared for months leaving me with no phone
Android,not_removed,that is exactly the reason i bought it its so smooth though
Android,not_removed,its the only reason imo that the phone is still useable such slow updatespacked with bloatit was pretty disappointing to see it all unfold with cos thankfully though them devs they were the real mvps
Android,not_removed,that nexus was a freaking whale of a phone too expensive and huge it was a major disappointment for me
Android,not_removed,maybe even better then my nexus there is no wayi went from the opo to the and the is night and day smoothermaybe not much faster but the overall experience is soo much nicer on the
Android,not_removed,never forget
Android,not_removed,i touched hours once
Android,not_removed,you can always downgrade nexus devices
Android,not_removed,the developer support is strong though and the oneplus one and two have amazingstable mm roms but yes i agree everyone doesnt root or change roms on their phone oneplus should push updates quickly
Android,not_removed,who needs a bullshit fingerprint sensor as someone that had the same mindset and now has a phone with oneits freakin amazing
Android,not_removed,true wonder why they skipped nfc on the oneplus two pretty sure nfc will return with the
Android,not_removed,its a good phone for the price nothing great its my international travel and toilet phone
Android,not_removed,im seeing it as well you see articlesvideos all over about how good it still is yet in actuality it was nothing more than an average flagship with a few mid range aspects and an attractive price so wheres this type of videos for literally any other flagship phone of that era
Android,not_removed,says the guy with a first gen moto g
Android,not_removed,what rom do you suggest
Android,not_removed,im thinking of switching to sultan from exodus because of cmte have you tried any other marshmallow roms
Android,not_removed,i ripped the antenna mount off the phone when i took it apart to change my screen and now its a very big media player so i went and bought a used lg instead to try something new
Android,not_removed,that plus the incredibly battery life on debut each android version seems to squash it lower and lower sadly
Android,not_removed,my phone was really super smooth when i first bought it i might have to do a factory reset on it
Android,not_removed,do these roms have any issues i often hear about something or the other not working on custom roms like fingerprint scanner or bluetooth or dual sim or nfc etc is that the case with one plus or do they work fine
Android,not_removed,darkobas rom was very good it is not cm based but offers good battery life
Android,not_removed,so basically your only reference is peoples opinions online
Android,not_removed,and its still fairly good
Android,not_removed,no it depends when the roms are in beta stages things might not work but the stable versions have no issues
Android,not_removed,what phone you have has everything to do with your comment the first gen moto g is probably the hardest circlejerked about phone in this subs history save for maybe maybe the nexus
Android,not_removed,yep nothing teaches as well as messing something up big time
Android,not_removed,not sure why youve been downvoted youre telling the truth why buy a phone if you know the company behind it isnt behind it at all
Android,not_removed,haha youre bang on the fucking money with the vaping and opo analogy ive never actually thought about it like that but its incredibly accurate
Android,not_removed,i am playing it in ireland and have been assigned the british flag on the leaderboard 😞
Android,not_removed,the app itself looks quite nice the advertisement after every round is a little annoying but on the other hand ads are always annoying its not too bad the only thing that might be asked too often is something devided by zero i personally think its a good idea to train basic math skills but it would be interesting to have a version with harder mathe problems overall well done
Android,not_removed,built you a more material icon if youd like to use it just let me know and ill send everything across httpssnaltyxyzdesignmatholympicspng
Android,not_removed,love this app i have been playing it constantly for the past few days cant wait for the harder game modes btw i have issues with my flag as well i am from belgium and i get a dutch flag instead
Android,not_removed,can you have a setting for different keypad layouts or a size tweak the game is pretty fun but needs to be harder
Android,not_removed,are you jared
Android,not_removed,i got another user from ireland and it worked perfectly for them are you on the edge of ireland or something that could mess it up
Android,not_removed,that is odd that is where youre phone thinks you are i guess gb im sorry
Android,not_removed,thank you ive noticed the divided by zero thing myself and i may try to limit how often that occurs i think i will add a version with harder math soon and see how that goes thanks for the input
Android,not_removed,that is awesome please send it over how did you make it ie which program
Android,not_removed,that is great looks like your on top of the leaderboards i might be adding new game modes soon and im sorry about the flag issues
Android,not_removed,what do you mean expand on the keyboard idea please and yes i will be adding harder game modes any ideas for the harder game mode questions
Android,not_removed,yep are you dank memes
Android,not_removed,i seen that alright im in the republic i might delete and redownload it again
Android,not_removed,twitch ireland isnt part of httpsenwikipediaorgwikigreatbritain and you can see more sorry reddit they did ask for feedback
Android,not_removed,httpssnaltyxyzdesignmatholympicsrar here you go it was made using adobe illustrator although inkscape would work fine
Android,not_removed,how about a phone numpad its more intuitive for me there are two easy ways you can add more operators or use bigger numbers
Android,not_removed,olasonn
Android,not_removed,i dont think that will fix the issue i will try to fix this in a future update i might end up adding a choose your flag option
Android,not_removed,thank you will include this in the next version
Android,not_removed,hmmm ill think about it i like the custom keyboard because i can make changes to it and can control it easier and it looks better thanks for the math ideas i will implement them in the new version i might also add parenthesis occasionally like this x
Android,not_removed,no problem can i use the icon in my portfolio
Android,not_removed,i wouldnt really want unnecessary parentheses though like in your example your dont need them if you follow the order of operations
Android,not_removed,absolutely nice work
Android,not_removed,just because samsung makes android phones doesnt mean that this is suitable for this sub this is better suited for rgadgets or something
Android,not_removed,theyre exploding

Android,not_removed,this was always going to be an uphill struggle
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,sad as someone who uses rooted capabilities a lot i suppose android pay will never be for me doesnt really affect me anyway until chase starts working
Android,not_removed,i really wish root access on phones was considered as safe as administrator access on a computer it shouldnt be cat and mouse just let the end user take responsibility for what theyre doing
Android,not_removed,its much easier to patch vulnerabilities than finding them and finding then is increasingly harder at some point hackers will still have an incentive but wellintentioned community members wont
Android,not_removed,are rooted devices any less secure than older os versions not being updated i mean they both pose a massive risk either way
Android,not_removed,honestly i think this is pretty disingenuous i think peoplegoogle includedreally want to go apple with walled gardens full platform control etc and they just want an excuse this whole thing with users actually owning their phones etc was never ever something the manufacturers cell operators etc found acceptable and they pretty much all do their best to lock things down as much as they can the only reason the nexus program was open to begin with was because you need a dev phone root custom frameworks etc were always considered heretical and undesirable from the perspective of the large companies involved if ford could get away with locking down their cars like apple can their phones do you think they wouldnt do it no they absolutely would as much as they could get away with the thing is though end usersconsumers spent a lot of time and effort fighting for the right to own thingsright to repair etc we all get that benefit but with computer devices we dont thanks to the dmca and some other really unfortunate legislation fuck all that though if android does get locked down to that degree ill probably go back to flip phones or android phones no way am i spending on a fake computer toy thing
Android,not_removed,thanks for correcting the articles clickbait headline it doesnt seem like rooting is the issue as stated in the article but rather using apps like android pay while rooted i honestly couldnt care less about android pay or any of their competitors and dont even know any retailers that use it but i do not want to lose the ability to root my devices
Android,not_removed,didnt chainfire sell or involve a mystery group with supersu
Android,not_removed,eh im going to switch to apple when that happens because the main and i dare say — only reason why i root is to install adaway since google is primarily an ad company i doubt theyll make adblockers or any other sort of traffic manipulation software firstgrade citizens
Android,not_removed,i dont buy android devices so that i can be treated like an apple customer as soon as hardware developers realize that we can start getting devices that let the user do exactly what he wants with it
Android,not_removed,he is right this is why magisk is the next big thing because it makes it really simple to toggle root on and off
Android,not_removed,safety net api is this open source couldnt this just be hacked so that way it checks everything but itself ultimately its no big concern for me right now i mainly use root to block ads and increase battery life
Android,not_removed,didnt an update allow android pay to work with root
Android,not_removed,it sucks that you cant use nfc payments on custom roms
Android,not_removed,if you want root buy a nexus i got an and miss my because i cant have xposed or root unless i want to trip knox
Android,not_removed,exactly hope he will not even consider trying to bypass this too much work
Android,not_removed,as long as the phone makes no difference between malware and power user yeah it will
Android,not_removed,if google and cohorts would be able to design the systems more robustly so the main app processor would not need to be trusted at all does this mean that it would technically be possible to build android pay in a way that rooting a device does not compromise its security
Android,not_removed,i just wish i could use it without a credit card all my club cards are stored on it
Android,not_removed,ive already come to terms ill never use android pay may be because it just doesnt work on my country yet but the idea of being able to pay with my phone just doesnt sound good to me especially if i need to chose root vs pay but dont worry creditdebit cards also come equipped with nfc to do mostly the same as android pay so all you really need to do is jam your card between your phones back and its case there you can now pay with the back of your phone like you otherwise wouldve done anyway
Android,not_removed,well if its any comfort for you android pay is not available in greece so i cant actually use it either
Android,not_removed,honestly yeah android pay is a bit distressing because it has direct financial access but this s not a real argument peoples financial security is like rating and super locking down android and android pay is not the answer this stuff is just trying to block people from rooting devices which google has never supported wanted to support or to permit at all and other shit i dont have much sympathy for it
Android,not_removed,so why doesnt android pay work on rooted phones
Android,not_removed,magisk
Android,not_removed,could always use a cheap old esh nexus for payments edit for anyone whos über shocked that i would suggest that my father has about maybe more cards and other things he has an iphone as a work phone so it would work
Android,not_removed,the average user gets malware on their pc because of it though i still wish it were allowed but just disabled by default hidden with developer options or something
Android,not_removed,that would be nice except youd still have those people who think they know what theyre doing and complain despite at your own risk warnings
Android,not_removed,what firewall app are you using or will you recommend
Android,not_removed,yeah agreed all google needs to do is make it so their is a proper privacy setting like afwallxprivacy so we can block unwanted access but they should also include something like titanium backup that allows us to delete bloatware and backup app data in case we do factory resets most people root i think for battery lifeperformancebloatware uninstallxprivacy
Android,not_removed,not per se if you only root your phone and dont install any root apps the risk is low the risk gets higher when you install root apps many of them are trusted but you should never trust an app and particularly never trust root apps from random sources or even the ones recently published on the play store
Android,not_removed,i believe safety net is only one of the providers that checks for system integrity theres a way to spoof safetynet values but that doesnt really work safety net will return a positive value system is not altered locally but the checks are done on googles servers so apps that rely on it will still fail to work
Android,not_removed,not unless you build a device that can run trusted code ie android pays back end processing on a cpu and in ram that the usernormal app cpuram cant ever access even if it has root this would also require the bootloader to be locked down and youd probably not have access to flash either theres no benefit to google et el to make that happen when they can just restrict root on the cpu they already have
Android,not_removed,nothing is ever secure you can never have true security
Android,not_removed,im rooted and use android pay just fine for my club cards like kroger meijer and speedway i have a credit card attached but i cant use it does it require a card on initial setup
Android,not_removed,i think paying in general isnt available in greece
Android,not_removed,this stuff is just trying to block people from rooting devices which google has never supported wanted to support or to permit at all and other shit why do you think google doesnt want to permit rooting at all when they offer their nexus devices with unlocked bootloaders as much as i hate it i do understand that some people may want to prevent using android pay with rooted devices but google has never done anything to prevent rooting just they decided that some apps wont work with root if google wanted to not permit root they could certainly do a lot more to android to actively prevent usage like preventing access to the play store or searching for the binary and removing execute permissions the only thing theyve done so far is not allowing root on a cts certified device and preventing android pay from working on a device whos security model may be compromised both which make sense depending on who you talk to and neither outright screams google doesnt want you to root your device
Android,not_removed,something something security
Android,not_removed,basically it boils down to pci compliance the longer answer is very long the tldr is your phone when using android pay handles parts of the transaction that must be guaranteed secure not just probably secure a rooted device means its only probably secure
Android,not_removed,because they say so
Android,not_removed,no even the days of magisk is numbered start finding out new unpatched vulnerabilities in the android system soon because sooner or later that app will stop working just like systemless root and everything else before it
Android,not_removed,you dont get the posts do you
Android,not_removed,in denmark weve got contactless credit card android pay is easier but using the card would be much easier than carrying a phone around just for payments
Android,not_removed,what whats the point of carrying around a second smartphone to replace your card it defeats the entire purpose of mobile payments which is to minimize clutter i might just be taking nfc cards for granted but even chip and pin cards werent inconvenient at all they dont need charging and they fit in my wallet
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus as my secondary phone but i dont have it on me all the time after all mobile payments are convenient because you only have to carry your phone if you need to carry a secondary phone it defeats the purpose and you could use a contactless card directly
Android,not_removed,hidden by default is fine by me the people capable of using it would naturally find it
Android,not_removed,the average user gets malware on their pc because of it yet theyre still allowed to do online banking
Android,not_removed,i cant believe this isnt already a thing root access should just be a check box inside developer options especially on nexus phones it makes phones so much more useable i downgraded to lollipop to get root id rather that than or
Android,not_removed,that happens already with computers and those people have to suck it up
Android,not_removed,what about rerouting requests to a local webserver
Android,not_removed,i still dont understand why it has to be like this in android i mean my windows computer is also bootloader unlocked rooted and i can still use it to manage my bank accounts
Android,not_removed,you are right for example you could always guess a number of bits come on take a guess it is between and for sure things dont have to be perfectly secure just way more secure as our capabilities to break things
Android,not_removed,assuming this isnt a racist comment ill just say that there are some restrictions yes but most of them are lifted and being lifted gradually
Android,not_removed,why do you think google doesnt want to permit rooting at all when they offer their nexus devices with unlocked bootloaders theyve pushed back against root before they tried to get cyanogen to take it out of the rom entirely they sell a device that doesnt have a bootloader because they have to in order for devs to get stuff done yes ios uses a different paradigmno that wouldnt work for android not if google wants to keep all of androids specific advantages preventing root has never been a priority but google has never been comfortable with nondevelopers having root compare to the oems though and google sure looks laissez faire which is i think where people get the impression that google doesnt care
Android,not_removed,well on my linux laptop chrome will automatically save my credit card info how is that more secure than using android pay on a rooted phone
Android,not_removed,which is dishonest anyway even non rooted security cannot be guaranteed i think its just another way to persecute people that want control of their own device
Android,not_removed,what android pay in denmark how did i miss this when i was there not that we have it in sweden or even can activate it feels bad saying this but denmark feels much more forward then sweden in those regards contactless payments would work in terminals now most have support for it but swedish banks are idiots only icabanken has any kind of contact less support and services like android pay and ipay or whatever apples are called is not supported at all and you guys got cheap ass data on cellular times more data for the money spent then sweden on even same isp
Android,not_removed,ive got a contact less card here in the us from wells fargo pretty convenient
Android,not_removed,the whole point of android pay is to use one phone for all your cards carrying the cards kind of ignores the whole point of it
Android,not_removed,carrying a phone around just for payments which nobody does ever
Android,not_removed,well if you do happen to use the second phone for other purposes as well say maybe offline music other games that take up data etc it could be a little more useful
Android,not_removed,thats a bad example given anything running under root admin can do the same thing this is why ms tried to push uac so idiots wouldnt run their browser as an admin process the main difference is people ostensibly are less concerned about what applications they install on their phone and what rights it maymay not use
Android,not_removed,people dont think their phones are a computer thats the only reason
Android,not_removed,your computer doesnt have direct access to the banks infrastructure
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,yes of course because nobody has ever broken basic encryption systems oh wait that happens all the time doesnt it
Android,not_removed,they tried to get cyanogen to take it out of the rom entirely where did you hear that the only thing im aware of is root couldnt be included with their commercial offerings if they wanted to include google play store you cant pass cts with root that wasnt google trying to get then to remove it it was google upholding their requirements for access to the additional google apps they sell a device that doesnt have a bootloader because they have to in order for devs to get stuff done you dont need a nexus device to do app development theyre nice to have if you want to develop roms but entirely unnecessary if youre just developing apps that dont require root
Android,not_removed,on your linux another application cannot interact with this information unless you grant permission eg through root on android once rooted apps can acquire root rights on demand yes you still need to grant access it if properly implemented one could find and use a way to just use it without prompt hence the lockdown from google to not take any risk for their reputation and the customers
Android,not_removed,because when you access a website through chrome all of the credit card processorpayment system information flows between the web server and the credit card back end system it doesnt matter if your copy of chrome is compromised you cant affect that system other than giving it bad data which can be checked for androidsamsungapple pay use your phone to talk directly to the credit card processor and therefore its security is a lot more important
Android,not_removed,theres an irony to the fact that rooted phones arent allowed even though they can be secure yet its completely permissible to run android pay on devices with significant unpatched vulnerabilities provided they are unmodified
Android,not_removed,the reason lies in how android sandboxes apps android pay contains sensitive data and handles sensitive data part of the pci compliance that allows android pay to function means that the device must protect that data in certain ways when android pay saves data the sandboxing means other apps cant access that data on a rooted device thats not true which makes that data not secure and by extension the device isnt pci compliant which at the end of the day means google is on the hook for fines and fraud if they didnt attempt to mitigate the vulnerability heres an httpwwwxdadeveloperscomgooglesecurityengineerexplainsissueswithrootandandroidpayinthexdaforums on the topic from a google engineer
Android,not_removed,small stuff and big stuff both i pay rent with wechat months at a time
Android,not_removed,no we dont have android pay here just yet it was more like a whatif thing we do have mobilepay though which is just as good and more universal than android pay since all banks support it and almost all stores also supports it im pretty sure that sweden also has mobilepay but yeah the data is pretty fucking nice im paying kr for gb data which is neat
Android,not_removed,what so youre saying its more convenient to carry two phones one of which you are only using for paying rather than carrying cards so you have charge two phones instead of one effectively its like having having credit cards that you have to charge thats not convenient at all
Android,not_removed,i was replying to a guy who suggested exactly that dude
Android,not_removed,i sure may hope his phone does neither
Android,not_removed,a phone does
Android,not_removed,dammit
Android,not_removed,its a good thing then that basic encryption is used by basically nobody worth their salt give me a link to a person who broke a salted rsaaes hash purely through brute force oh wait
Android,not_removed,one of the cyanogen devs wrote about google asking them to not include root it was like a year or two ago so good luck finding it they correctly imo decided to not listen you dont need a nexus device to do app development theyre nice to have if you want to develop roms but entirely unnecessary if youre just developing apps that dont require root be that as it may theyre definitely the most convenient devices to develop on the only advantage a different device has is compatibility testing
Android,not_removed,on your linux another application cannot interact with this information unless you grant permission that would only be true if you ran your browser from a separate user account otherwise any app can access all your files
Android,not_removed,isnt the only person that could somehow possibly get fucked over by this the user that presumably rooted then found and installed and then granted root access to some kind of malware is there a bigger risk of doing all of this on ones phone compared to someone doing this on their personal computer i feel like theres surely more people with viruses on their pcs i mean should microsoft prohibit people from using their own computers to access their banks too
Android,not_removed,whats your argument that its easier to find a way to bypass the root prompt on the linux based android than on linux by some unknown hack i mean its a theoretical question anyway since everything secure should be encrypted
Android,not_removed,on a rooted device thats not true which makes that data not secure no idea how they can seriously say this even on a rooted device there are bugs especially with the pitiful patching practices most providers employ rooted phones use some version of supersu that controls what and when an app can use root privileges there might be bugs in that too but it is silly to say that simply because a phone is rooted it is inherently less secure than rooted it all depends on the patch state of the software and how robust it is in the first place they might get away with much more sloppy programming if all phones were locked out of root this is not a good thing they can mitigate the vulnerability by writing good code blaming it on some nebulous fantasy such as root evil is nothing but a copout
Android,not_removed,we have something called swish that more use but mainly for smaller businesses with dont use card readers saw that mobilepay everywhere but denmark is much more ahead with things like all digital official mail etc
Android,not_removed,what carrier i pay dkk for with oister
Android,not_removed,the suggestion to carry two phones around just for payments was moronic i was pointing out that android pay lets you store all your credit and debit cards without having to carry them all around making it more convenient than using tap and pay cards if you have more than a few
Android,not_removed,that sentence hurt my brain
Android,not_removed,android pay makes connections to back end systems that your browser does not thats why you can go to any bank website in chrome but android pay only works with banks that are willing to support it without that connection you end up with google wallet which required all of your transactions to go through a virtual account held by google
Android,not_removed,that would actually mean something if brute forcing aes was the mode of attack you dont get to defend where youre strongest youre forced to defend where youre weakest thats reality
Android,not_removed,one of the cyanogen devs wrote about google asking them to not include root it was like a year or two ago so good luck finding it they correctly imo decided to not listen ive never seen any reports of that id imagine it wouldve shown up in randroid or rcyanogenmod i even tried googling it but those terms pull up a ton of nonrelated results but its entirely possible i missed it either way theres a lot of stuff google could do to try and discourage rooting a device but theyve only chosen to prevent certification which i agree with and android pay which i dont agree with but i do understand be that as it may theyre definitely the most convenient devices to develop on the only advantage a different device has is compatibility testing only because theyre running vanilla android being able to unlock the bootloader andor root the device doesnt affect regular devs and is only really beneficial to rom developers and developers for rootenabled apps
Android,not_removed,your point is totally right and common sense id say thing here is and this is total speculation that google does not want to give any chance of a disaster for the android platform people rooting their phone are most of the time aware what it actually does and the capabilities of this and what it can result in still google does not have the ability to prevent things from happening which could damage the image security is a whole topic you can talk about all day long and the monthly patches are too slow for the it security environment things can happen in no time sometimes even going unnoticed for quite some time this is what google tries to prevent its not about a persons capability or responsibility but rather the damage prevention in regards to the image of android again this is my point of view why google does not want it
Android,not_removed,isnt the only person that could somehow possibly get fucked over by this the user that presumably rooted technically the credit card company would have to pay which is why theyre trying to force it to be locked down they cant control microsoft dell or mozilla foundation or whoever but they can control android and the phone oems because phones arent considered general computers for most people they dont really notice if microsoft released a new version of windows that blocked you from ever using administrator rights the outrage would be intensethey would never be able to enforce that with phones people are willing to accept that they dont own the device and that its not a real computer and that their cell carrier or oem or whoever are the real owners because of that an opportunity is arising for the forces that want to to push out and take control of peoples secondary devices which are increasingly becoming peoples primary devices this has been a push since the and those pushing it havent given up
Android,not_removed,isnt the only person that could somehow possibly get fucked over by this the user that presumably rooted then found and installed and then granted root access to some kind of malware remember that a securityfocused system is only as secure as its weakest link if one user with an infected device ends up compromising the entire system because the user specifically gained root access to the device prior to being infected it honestly doesnt matter if everything else is fully secure its like the program smith going completely rogue within the supposedly secure matrix system threatening to bring down the entire system and nobody in was aware one of their own has gone rogue
Android,not_removed,i dont understand whats so difficult google provides monthly security updates for vulnerabilities to keep users safe google officially provides android pay to its users so they can pay with their phones and keeps that safe what google wont do is allow you to use unofficial potentially exploitable software in conjunction with your financial assets potentially compromising everything so you can have your icon packs trust is not easily won and google has a lot riding on this its simply not worth it it in their eyes
Android,not_removed,the theory is that actually most rooted android devices are being held by people who dont even know malware has rooted their phone for them this is then used to insert ads and tracksell user data
Android,not_removed,i have no knowledge about how root is acquired on android in comparison to linux if it is the same yes it is more likely to be detected and closed this does not mean that some things can go undetected for quite some time as you mentioned this all is quite theoretically
Android,not_removed,no idea how they can seriously say this its because root allows any app to access any part of the filesystem thats inherently less secure android pay relies in part on its data not being available to other apps its a risk that the payment processors and banks arent willing to take
Android,not_removed,also oister they had some birthday deals which i took advantage of and still using
Android,not_removed,the suggestion to carry two phones around just for payments was moronic which i agree with i was pointing out that android pay lets you store all your credit and debit cards without having to carry them all around making it more convenient than using tap and pay cards if you have more than a few which i also agree with but the comment i originally replied to suggested using another phone just for android pay that is definitely not more convenient than just carrying cards
Android,not_removed,so the phone acts a bit like a card terminal
Android,not_removed,okay but to call aes basic is simply wrong
Android,not_removed,google officially provides android pay to pay to its users so they can pay with the phones yo dawg
Android,not_removed,thanks for the response i guess but i dont think you answered like any of my questions you just stated what we already know
Android,not_removed,and why is that a problem are they saying their payment software is so buggy and weak it can be so easily compromised by changing a file windows allows users to run everything as admin root equivalent yet there are still payment options that are extremely secure the excuse they are giving against root is nonsensical there is obviously some other motivation behind it
Android,not_removed,im just gonna keep an eye out for future deals then thanks
Android,not_removed,yep thats it no party in between so using it is exactly like using your card itself
Android,not_removed,which is why i did not and would not do that youre the one who brought aes into this i pointed out that this whole thing about root is insecurelack of root is secure doesnt actually reflect reality because theres no such thing as complete security nothing is secure sure in theory an encryption algorithm is good and aes is unbroken as far as i know but that doesnt mean a given is secure to any reasonable standard
Android,not_removed,thats ok did instead because when you access a website through chrome all of the credit card processorpayment system information flows between the web server and the credit card back end system it doesnt matter if your copy of chrome is compromised you cant affect that system other than giving it bad data which can be checked for androidsamsungapple pay use your phone to talk directly to the credit card processor and therefore its security is a lot more important
Android,not_removed,sorry for my confusion uimdh was talking about aes so i assumed that you were calling it basic

Android,not_removed,im perfectly content with this so long as oneplus can follow through
Android,not_removed,and he is absolutely right android n like many other more important issues with oneplus and should have higher priority not to mention that the latency will automatically be fixed with android as noted on the other posts the overwhelming majority of users in there commented that they saw it as a nonissue most like me didnt realize it was one before it was brought up neither did any reviewer whether it was xda or anandtech btw and incidentally the people who blow the issue out of proportion are those who dont even own the even about the issue has less than of registered users complaining about it i do not know what is up with people on randroid and their need to constantly shit on the many people were making comments like what did you expect from a mediocre chinese company the more i read about the more glad i am for never purchasing it is it because it has gotten great feedback from those who have purchased it reviewers and others while they are stuck with much more expensive flagships themselves like the twice as expensive pixel which is far from perfect btw seems to be held to a higher standard than any other phone in here months ago people were shitting on it for its color accuracy now it is something which for me personally is one of the most important aspects of a phone people were shitting on it for not having more than apps because im supposed to believe that people actually multitask with more than apps at once open in the background and now it keeps more apps in the background than most if not all the leading flagship phones crushing such flagships like the galaxy in multitasking performance and on and on it continues people talk about shitty customer support from but ever since they released their phone they have given us a pretty darn good srgb mode constantly improved camera software and better ram management not to mention that the was one of the best devices in terms of raw performance and when it came to throttling according to moreover pretty soon they will update the with a bump in storage speeds making the already lightning quick opening of apps even faster shows that it is faster than even the iphone in this regard in addition i am sure by the time they have fixed touch latency or even exceeded most other flagships in this regard that this aspect of the phone will also be all but forgotten by you people the same way the ram management and color accuracy issues were i could also go into such great features like their market leading finger print sensor or dash charging where charging makes the battery hot and degrades it faster with other devices and how its so terrible that other flagship phones cant be just as good how oneplus can increase the battery considerably without increasing thickness or weight whereas other oems cannot do the same how oneplus a small team of people can create one of the most color accurate displays on a phone whereas a company like google cannot do the same for an phone you would think a phone that cost so little for what it came with in terms of hardware design software and features would be the phone to be the least criticized instead the is heavily criticized and most often by those who do not even own it how about you guys ask us owners how we feel about our phone instead of telling us how we should feel about i im a smartphone enthusiast and i have triedowned more or less every single flagship phone the past few years i personally think that the is by far the best phone of followed by the pixel i have also had no issues whatsoever with the touch latency if i ever did it would be very low on my list of things to care about on a phone
Android,not_removed,i did some research and found out some astounding facts that sheds more light on the stupidity of the complaint about touch latency everyone uses les numeriques as their source for testing touch latency on displays the device they use to test with the walt latency timer was used only once and then dropped for its unreliability by anandtech anandtech themselves tested it with the htc and noted that the phone was noticeably more touch responsive than other phones despite the test numbers showing it wasnt the case the same numbers found by by ln but here comes the fun part ln the source that people use when they claim the has a delay of because no other source has tested touch latency or claimed that number they noted that the google pixel had a touch latency of thats less than what they found the to have it goes to show how wrong so many people in here have been and how blown out of proportion this thing is on the one hand you have this number is not an exaggeration but based on the registered number of people complaining about it on the oneplus forum of users going what latency i dont know what you are talking about on the other you have a few dozen angry owners the rest being people who dont own the who criticize it as well as hailing the pixel for its fantastic and market leading touch latency but according to ln the pixel has or had – whether it has been updatedfixed i dont know approximately the same touch latency as the therefore we can draw two conclusions from this either both numbers are wrong and we cant take ln and their testing methodology seriously like anandtech noted or we can accept the fact that both devices have bad delay pre android or and that once the gets the update it will be fixed one thing is for sure and that is how misleading and how full of it some of the users in here have been about this topic by their standards the pixel must be practically unusable the same goes for all other phones really seeing as the average smartphone has a touch latency of as numbers for other smartphones these are all before android according to ln phone latency asus zenfone max acer liquid zest plus meizi cat phones echo smart archos diamond selfie motorola moto x style motorola moto x force oneplus microsoft lumia htc one google nexus sony xperia xz google nexus sony xperia x compact htc desire google nexus oneplus sony xperia xp lg samsung galaxy zte axon huawei htc iphone samsung galaxy edge iphone plus samsung galaxy edge huawei honor sony xperia compact iphone samsung galaxy note edge iphone plus edit uarnoudtweakers who says he is a reviewer of the largest tech site in the netherlands made a post about this topic in one of the threads over at randroid he noted that he did a touch latency comparison and saw a difference between the and the iphone plus in touch latency whereas he did not notice a difference between the and the pixel this corresponds with lns numbers you can find the post he concluded in his test which you can check out that the touch latency is approximately equal to that of devices like the oneplus he continues that perhaps the optimizations are not in touch latency of the finger to the registration but at the time of registration of the contact to the corresponding action by the operating system as he found that the pixel opened apps faster than the iphone
Android,not_removed,lets hope they manage its not bad now but theres a reason people are hyping how incredibly fast the pixel is getting on iphonepixel level snappiness would be nice no
Android,not_removed,pushing out android n first is a good idea since nougat already has some touch latency optimizations
Android,not_removed,just got an oxygenos ota dropped claiming to have tweaked the firmware for the digitiser will report back edit sorry was at work and completely forgot to post after downloading the update i havent noticed any improvement or deterioration in the performance of the touch screenit just kind of works the same as it did before
Android,not_removed,is this something that would be addressed if you flash a custom rom or is the issue much deeper than that
Android,not_removed,i wish someone with an high speed camera could end that whole bullshit issue once and for all i was just watching a youtuber testing the effect of gsyncfreesync technologies on input lag on pc it was pretty much pluging a led on the button you are testing and then looking with the high speed camera when the computer actually gets the information the test itself is not really complicated on android either unfortunately it requires an expensive high speed camera to be accurate so if you read this and have an high speed camera please end this just a very basic android app and an high speed camera would end this instantly
Android,not_removed,touch issue if you do a side by side comparison and look really close then you can kind of tell there is a difference
Android,not_removed,nearly every single android device has touch latency issues its one of the biggest reasons i can never get myself to fully switch from ios
Android,not_removed,yeah why focus on issues that people are already suffering from lets just ignore them and create new ones
Android,not_removed,you get what you pay for
Android,not_removed,ill be honest if they fix the latency issue and make it even better than the pixel i would highly consider buying a oneplus
Android,not_removed,i would think that basic functionality would supercede a major os upgrade
Android,not_removed,i cant really describe it that well but this article on xda explains it pretty well
Android,not_removed,touch latency is the time between putting the finger on the screen and seeing the response of the phone on the screen of the phone i am a reviewer for the largest tech website in the netherlands ive tested the during my pixel and pixel xl review which should have better touch latency due to android ive got no equipment to measure it exactly but this is what my slow motion camera a pixel filmed using the same movement on an iphone plus and pixel xl there were no noticable differences between the pixel and therefore whatever the exact measurement will be there is hardly real world difference visible between the pixel xl galaxy edge and there is a difference with the iphone plus which is a little better in this regard
Android,not_removed,prioritization does not equal not doing it at all n is a big undertaking
Android,not_removed,you just said what ive been wanting to say for months i use the iphone plus for my daily driver but i always keep a android phone on the side out of every android phone i have owned this year the was my favorite i just find it hilarious that people on this sub feel the need to justify purchasing their pixel xl by crapping on a phone with the same specs for less the hands down is the best android option on the market
Android,not_removed,i think the reason that people shit on oneplus so much here is because they kind of marketed themselves as like a tech startup that is for the geek community and so when there are problems like this and the response isnt what everyone wants there is a bitch about it all but its like everyone says there will always be more people talking about the problems with the device than there will be people talking about how theyve had no problems but like i totally agree that if the pixel had all these problems it would be a non issue and google would get a pass on it but the fact that oneplus has them just makes it a massive deal the same thing happened with the oneplus ones touchscreen issues and the lack of quickcharge with the oneplus
Android,not_removed,this is precisely how it was for the pixel on this sub it was always the people who dont own it making huge stinks over it its just the nature of things around here unfortunately
Android,not_removed,not to mention that the latency will automatically be fixed with android lets not jump to conclusions touch latency is a combination of all the layers remember we dont know how much was improved in the os and how much was hardware and driver improvements so dont assume it automatically gets better with an update could also go into such great features like their market leading finger print sensor or dash charging where charging makes the battery hot and degrades it faster with other devices and how its so terrible that other flagship phones cant be just as good dash charging is not interesting to me until it uses usb c power delivery until then is not universal and isnt interesting just like qualcomm quick charge though now wont any longer be violating the usb spec i dont see this happening and if it does i dont see how it can maintain spec parity without losing any features of dash charging
Android,not_removed,the device they use to test with the walt latency timer was only used once and then dropped for its unreliability by anandtech keep in mind walt is a cheap diy solution to testing touch latency it is quite possible that there is a configuration issue for anandtech or something like that the average smartphone has a touch latency of youre including some pretty crappy noname brand phones on that list that are skewing the average the oneplus is the second worst flagship on that list third worst if you include the moto x ahead of only the oneplus also you seem to be missing some of the devices know for their touch latency like the htc
Android,not_removed,as the excuses get more convoluted at some point its gonna be a lot less effort to just fix the damn problem dont you think
Android,not_removed,ill give it a guess but theres a lot of interactions in the phone from when you touch the screen until something happens you touch the screen then the digitizer takes time to realize that youve done so it has to send data to the cpu it has to figure out where youve touched and after that it has to figure out what virtual button was under your touch so it has to perform that action and finally it updates the screen whole lot of actions the os might not be optimized or something remember just a guess
Android,not_removed,i think a lot of it is just that hype ive seen the app loading tests etc between the and the pixel and the is usually faster on those tests im not saying i think the is a better phone but im not disappointed i got it i cant notice any of these supposed latency issues but it opens up things remarkably fast
Android,not_removed,would be nice but its not gonna happen on a chinese budget phone the high paper specs and low price of oneplus are based on others doing rd and others building up the economies of scale building up the os etc and these guys just come in buy cheap commercial off the shelf components and stuff them in a case skip all the regular expenses like advertising and give people a false sense of just how much money a high end smartphone should cost based on all the costs involved youre not gonna get quality from them youll get whatever is off the shelf from the overflow of asian supply chains and thats it
Android,not_removed,any updates so far did it improve anything with regards to the digitizer
Android,not_removed,android drastically improves on touch latency its almost no different from ios
Android,not_removed,lol you are so wrong apple has only truly had a proper advantage with the and impressive numbers with the iphone meaning for two generations at best to compare htc from that same year had a touch latency of go further back to the iphone and you had a touch latency of not bad for its time but certainly not impressive either also iphone regressed quite a bit thats almost double of what was the case with iphone models its also around the same numbers from several flagships from this year like the htc and edge
Android,not_removed,nougat is more important the latency issue is a nitpick and pretty much a non issue
Android,not_removed,couldnt agree more user experience always takes priority over an unneeded software update especially since one plus already incorporated most of ns features into their os
Android,not_removed,is that what happened to note buyers
Android,not_removed,perfect example of absurd expectations
Android,not_removed,right because the rn is so unusable
Android,not_removed,theyll address it in the next phone
Android,not_removed,my works perfect bring the n
Android,not_removed,this just underscores the findings of ln which puts touch latency of the pixel at and touch latency of at the iphone plus on the other hands is at
Android,not_removed,huh isnt oneplusoppovivo the biggest smartphone company outside of samsungapple
Android,not_removed,unless you need cdma 😔
Android,not_removed,unless you want a great display or a great camera or decent customer support or good audio quality or prompt security updates oryou get the idea
Android,not_removed,keep in mind walt is a cheap diy solution to testing touch latency it is quite possible that there is a configuration issue for anandtech or something like that maybe but its still worth nothing youre including some pretty crappy noname brand phones on that list that are skewing the average if i didnt people would go butbut based on your numbers thats not the average number theres lots of other bad latency phones i didnt include as well i just tried to pick enough phones at different latencies to give a perfect representation of the average also you seem to be missing some of the devices know for their touch latency like the htc the htc was the only known key device i was missing or were there more ill add it in for you now edit htc has now been added
Android,not_removed,i was thinking the same because that lists the nexus as having so why would google rave about the pixels touch latency when the was better
Android,not_removed,which is complete bs dave burke from google specifically said that the pixel has the lowest latency on any android device even matching the iphones when scrutinized under a high speed camera yes dave burke from google told us their phone was good therefore it must be true seriously how naive are you and do you understand the concept of empirical facts i also made it pretty clear that this was before android i dont doubt it has been massively improved with or though that remains to be seen but until you can show me numbers of its touch latency other than an empty statement from the very company that sells the phone proving it is the best of any android phone currently held by xperia compact and galaxy note edge then nothing of what you say is true the galaxy note edge is still best android phone in terms of touch latency at
Android,not_removed,excuses people were complaining about the having touch lag and the pixel being a fantastic device when they both are alike and when the touch lag on the is average for a phone i even proved that by showing numbers of several flagship models from this year that are very close to the in terms of touch latency
Android,not_removed,its literally a driver configuration thatd just be wasted effort then again they did release it with an extremely aggressive memory management so the device performed like a device in storing apps in ram so i guess theres a disconnect between the hardware design team and the software team hopefully some smart mind on xda fixes it
Android,not_removed,sorry i put it in the edit of the parent
Android,not_removed,you compared to one android device the htc which i actually owned and your link is to a fucking french website since the iphone ive noticed superior touch input latency
Android,not_removed,not to mention nougat might even have the fix n has touch latency improvements as seen in tests of multiple phones makes perfect sense to prioritise it ninjaedit thats but still kinda relevant easier going than with ready they can target the fix to that and port more easily port it to
Android,not_removed,touch latency is definitely not a nitpick the is a very fast phone that doesnt feel it because everything drags behind my finger noticeably my feels much more responsive
Android,not_removed,they are already getting heat for taking their time with nougat damned if they did and damned if they didnt
Android,not_removed,wont nougat help with touch latency or am i missing something
Android,not_removed,but you see people will be upset regardless of what a company decides to do if oneplus said okay we hear you guys were going to put the nougat update on the backburner until we figure this latency out then im sure there would be plenty of people pissed off that they arent getting nougat as a priority
Android,not_removed,unneeded how do you think the users will react if oneplus shelved rhe niugat update to work on something of users care about
Android,not_removed,haha nice one fam
Android,not_removed,agreed not something that of mobile phone users would notice one plus users tend to be more enthusiastic though hence it becoming a big deal
Android,not_removed,it should have been addressed before it left the door
Android,not_removed,thats kinda really high isnt it wasnt the note at about
Android,not_removed,oneplus still is rather small oppo electronics the parent company is pretty huge
Android,not_removed,i feel your pain was on the verizon for years until they raised my unlimited data price
Android,not_removed,maybe but its still worth nothing sure its just also worth noting that walt will likely make a comeback with sites like anandtech and xda once the calibration issues are figured out the anandtech htc review was pretty recent if i didnt people would go butbut based on your numbers thats not the average number theres lots of other bad latency phones i didnt include as well i just tried to pick enough phones at different latencies to give a perfect representation of the average it wasnt a question of which devices you picked it was pointing out that the average is pulled down heavily by crappy budget devices that oneplus does not want to perform like or be compared to the average among flagships especially flagships is much lower
Android,not_removed,the pixel shipped with the vp of engineering at google wouldnt get on stage and blatantly lie about something i dont know why youre taking all of this so personally are you paid by
Android,not_removed,and your link is to a fucking french website and since the iphone ive noticed superior touch input latency which just isnt true iphone the iphone had a delay of lg optimus g was close nexus was comparable at galaxy note was the best at iphone i already mentioned the having better latency than the iphone models this was example the compact was also better at the note edge which boasted a whopping response time the best of its generation has far better the note and huawei ascend matched them at and respectively so in iphone generation they certainly werent better than comparable android phones iphone for iphone generation they were dominant and would go under your definition of best with and scores for iphone and plus respectively but you still had competitve android flagships that still performed well compact at and edge at to give you some examples iphone for iphone the iphone and plus regressed from their predecessors and were at and ms respectively comparable android phones are edge at htc at little bit worse and huawei honor at little bit better in summary iphone have always had goodgreat touch delays though its troubling to see them regress the way they did this generation but this claim you make of not being able to switch from ios because android has touch latency issues is bollocks theres almost always a small handful of flagship phones from android that are comparable in touch latency to the iphone
Android,not_removed,i dont notice that at all the is blazing fast to me and buttery smooth never once thought about any latency issues after using it for months i remember reading a lot of reviews when it came out no one ever mentioned a latency issue or it effecting their use of the phone and phone reviewers are a lot more picky than me this seems like an issue that somehow just blew up overnight never heard of it until today
Android,not_removed,do you know its device specific tried that yesterday with of my brother and didnt notice any difference between my
Android,not_removed,the is a very fast phone that doesnt feel it because everything drags behind my finger noticeably my feels much more responsive this really goes to show how hard it is to take you seriously first off a phone being smooth and quick has nothing to do with latency even xda themselves who claimed the was one of the fastest devices they had ever tested noted this on their article about this latency issue secondly your precious nexus had a latency of until recently which is way way more than a lot of the competion and not far behind the very strange you never had any problems with your much more responsive all this time can it maybe be because this latency thing is a nonissue yes i believe so
Android,not_removed,seems to be they way it is now a days
Android,not_removed,youre right like holy shit if they put nougat behind people would be like i knew they couldnt deliver nougat soon who cares about touch latency i dont even face it
Android,not_removed,i think thats a feature but oneplus is only releasing
Android,not_removed,touch latency affects all users wether they notice it or not and from the xda post its not something that would take long to fix pushing the nougat update back a week or two isnt going to change anything at this point
Android,not_removed,i didnt really care or notice when i was using my iphone but once i switched to the it was definitely noticeable and still is annoying despite this the software is still fantastic and beats ios hands down especially notifications but after using the i would not buy again due to the touch latency still keeping it though
Android,not_removed,to be more exact it was the best of its class when it first came out samsungs flagships have always posted really good or excellent numbers and do in general have top notch hardware always best displays and camera too bad i cant say the same about their interface
Android,not_removed,galaxy note edge is and moto is on the same website
Android,not_removed,if it shipped with then those are the real numbers unless a later update fixed them so you either a accept them b disregard them but then also disregard the numbers as they are from the same source the vp of engineering at google wouldnt get on stage and blatantly lie about something oh yeah they certainly exaggerated sot of the phone or the fact that it had the best camera of any phone when the is still better i still dont understand how you can believe statements with no backing over empirical numbers its insanely stupid
Android,not_removed,touch latency is not just a product of hardware you fucking ding dong its part of the software code ios handles touch input insanely better and the fact that you dont know that shows me you have never actually owned an iphone or any of those phones you listed stop parroting bullshit articles and use your eyes
Android,not_removed,maybe you should read what i fucking said literally the first thing i said its a very fast phone secondly the has significantly improved latency on the why dont you post some evidence that its running on also i own both phones do you
Android,not_removed,a large percentage of the oneplus fan base specifically the oneplus forums are some of the most juvenile whiney android fans ive witnessed im not sure what it is but its very off putting and kind of makes me cringe when i realize im stuck with this user base for probably at least the next two years
Android,not_removed,oh yeah youre right dang
Android,not_removed,you wouldnt buy the again because of a minor bug that will be fixed soon that seems a little rash
Android,not_removed,if it shipped with then those are the real numbers unless a later update fixed them so you either a accept them b disregard them but then also disregard the numbers as they are from the same source this is assuming those numbers are even correct theres a high chance there are configuration issue were new to testing tough latency oh yeah they certainly exaggerated sot of the phone sot is a morons metric anyways though it is equivalent to me saying i can fit games on my hard drive or the fact that it had the best camera of any phone when the is still better review sites say otherwise for the most part they each have their trade offs
Android,not_removed,the camera can still be seen as could be better as it is better in some scenarios theres no denying that the pixel has better photos than the in some scenarios and the has better in others the sot exaggerated many people who actually own a pixel are getting hours of sot in real life usage if the nexus had touch latency why would they brag that the pixel is much better if youre claiming its worse makes no sense
Android,not_removed,touch latency is not just a product of hardware you fucking ding dong i never claimed that either you fucking ding dong ios handles touch input insanely better clearly it does not software impacts those numbers as well dimwit and the fact that you dont know that dont know what the fact and the actual numbers speak for themselves if youre too biased to accept the truth thats your own problem not my fault your a louzy fanboy shows me you have never actually owned an iphone or any of those phones you listed im a smartphone enthusiast and have tried practically all flagship phones the last few years i buy and sell them so i never lose any cash and i can tell you i have used all of the ones i listed except for ascent stop parroting bullshit articles and use your eyes yes because fuck facts right your opinion is more important and much more real
Android,not_removed,secondly the has significantly improved latency on the yes thats year after the release of the nexus meaning you went a full year with delay assuming fixed it something we dont know also i own both phones do you i did dropped the nexus over half a year ago the is basically the same stock experience on faster and better hardware much faster storage speeds much faster performance and it doesnt throttle or warm up under heavy use
Android,not_removed,if the nexus had touch latency why would they brag that the pixel is much better if youre claiming its worse makes no sense dont ask me but empirical data from the only acual touch latency test that we have at hand says the pixel had a latency of the same was said by uarnoudtweakers who a the reviewer of the largest tech site in the netherlands in this thread he noted that he did a touch latency comparison and saw a difference between the and the iphone plus in touch latency whereas he did not notice a difference between the and the pixel this corresponds with lns numbers either way you can not expect to be taken seriously when saying but google said it had great latency that is no form for evidence whatsoever also if you were to disregard ln one way to do this as i noted in my post is to refer to anandtechs opinion about the walt latency timer you must by definition also disregard the same numbers ln posted about the with the same test methodology and that so many people on randroid roneplus and oneplus forums are complaining about meaning that the socalled touch latency of the is as void of truth as the touch latency of the pixel and the touch latency of the nexus
Android,not_removed,where did you get the figure from anyway stop being so precious about your i like mine its a great phone the touch latency could be improved
Android,not_removed,its not just an issue with the the issue appears to affect a number of phones also oneplus have acknowleged it and will look into it do you think theyre going just leave it alone and never speak of it or work on it again is there any phone with bugs do any other manufacturers respond this quickly or at all about issues if youre going to avoid oneplus over this then there isnt any phone out there that will meet your expectations
Android,not_removed,where did you get the figure from xda
Android,not_removed,link
Android,not_removed,i was actually wrong touch latency is or was even higher at meaning only lower than reported on the seule petite ombre au tableau un retard tactile de la dalle qui monte à ms retard tacticle means touch latency
Android,not_removed,ill record my and tonight in slowmo on my camera to demonstrate the difference it is definitely more than ms which is not even perceptable
Android,not_removed,this was before the android update my point is that the had this reported dealy for a whole year before it got updated and nobody seemed to care about which honestly they shouldnt because even many months later when the htc was released les numeriques said that the general latency delay on phones was around ms
Android,not_removed,well in my case it has become an important issue since updating to the difference is massive and it made a huge difference to the experience now if it was always the same i might not have noticed the update has made me aware of the issue
Android,not_removed,but if you have no issue with it for a whole year then you can understand others not having issue with it right especially when considering that the average touch latency according to ln is at
Android,not_removed,well i didnt have an issue with adsl until i got fiber now i can never go back i can completely understand people not noticing it and i wouldnt recommended against buying an because of this particular issue if it can be improved though why shouldnt be ask for it
Android,not_removed,dont forget that this is based on me and your assumption that nexus touch latency improved drastically with android we dont know that and have yet to prove it with any numbers to show for it
Android,not_removed,if it can be improved though why shouldnt be ask for it its more about the fact that there are many more important issues form them to handle considering the limited resources the company has and the fact that the issue will be fixed automatically with android

Android,not_removed,thats the ios app any evidence that this is also available for android
Android,not_removed,hasnt this been the ui for a while ive had it for a while unless im missing something just realized the screenshots are ios so i guess the new update is for ios and the ui has been available on android for a while
Android,not_removed,it actually opens to my playlists now about damn time
Android,not_removed,they added the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen to youtube and google play newsstand on both ios and android so this update to play music will come to android
Android,not_removed,this is how it has been since few months i personally like this design
Android,not_removed,man i though that theyd updated the fucking android app whats this bs doing on this sub i thought image posts had to be modapproved
Android,not_removed,how does it run
Android,not_removed,what is the version number i got an update today but i dont have the new ui perhaps its a server side change
Android,not_removed,it doesnt work in my country
Android,not_removed,yes its been out since as far as i can tell its a us onlyall access feature you can however use httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomspeedsoftwaresqleditorhlengb to edit the database configdb config shouldenablethriller set to true reboot and then use a vpn to configure your recommendations in the settings needed once works fine after without the vpn ill make a detailed post tomorrow if people want it oh and its kind of a one way thing unless it gets reverted automatically as the changes are synced and appear on the web ui too
Android,not_removed,there is a new update for android it isnt live on all of the play stores yet but i updated manually and there appears to be no new ui ie no bottom nav bar must just be bug fixes
Android,not_removed,bottom navigation
Android,not_removed,its not an image post
Android,not_removed,because its been on android for a while
Android,not_removed,thats ios
Android,not_removed,you realize its ios right
Android,not_removed,bottom navigation was added to the md guidelines
Android,not_removed,see ya
Android,not_removed,there are still no bottom tabs on the android app regardless of where you are
Android,not_removed,ive had this for a while and i live in nz never needed to edit any code or use any vpn
Android,not_removed,bug fixes and performance improvements
Android,not_removed,yeah but im guessing thats an ios only addition
Android,not_removed,ah right hard to tell on the mobile webpage
Android,not_removed,indeed there isnt it does seem confusing to add a bottom bar and split the options between it and the nav drawer but then again it is google
Android,not_removed,do you have all access
Android,not_removed,agreed but might be an ios only addition
Android,not_removed,maybe im dumb but is all access the monthly subscription if so yes ive got that for the next months
Android,not_removed,so they are skipping i see
Android,not_removed,op has to have the worst rumours and leaks ever lol just a bunch of bloggers writing stuff from out of the air theres no confirmations of anything being close to true the phone will most likely come out in june or july especially waiting to get their hands on the
Android,not_removed,highly doubt theyre that experimental
Android,not_removed,nice but with the apparent move towards chip and pin is investing magstripe emulation a good idea im not in the target group but im curious still i think the security features are a big plus especially since everything seems to be stored locally and not on their servers
Android,not_removed,the whole reason i wanted mst was to remove all credit cards if i am going to carry a card like spendwallet i might as well just carry my primary cc
Android,not_removed,they wont be able to go to a bank and ask to be linked into their payment system since they have no established credibility so you can input a credit or debit card but you wont get the rotating tokenisation that makes using apple pay samsung pay android pay so vital also im pretty sure samsung owns patents on mst payments there would have to be a huge work around to ensure they are not infringing or this wont last long not to mention my the above lack of bank support
Android,not_removed,does anyone know if this works with gas stations samsung pay does not currently work with the gas pumps directly the machine needs a card swipe to activate does spendwallets mfe work with gas stations
Android,not_removed,is this related to looppay if not and they can make this without infringing on patents samsung bought why didnt apple do this themselves for apple pay
Android,not_removed,good to know i thought mst was samsungs exclusive patent。
Android,not_removed,aaaannddd indiegogo nope
Android,not_removed,this is why samsung pay only works with certain banks the partnership allows them to tokenize the chip and pin auth which is why samsung pay works even when you have a chip and pin cardterminal so the gamble here isnt how long before chip and pin takes over but whether the startup can get banks to partner with them
Android,not_removed,yeah the chippin move is what ive been hearing a lot also but so far lot of places have magnetic systems still so it might be worth it for a little longer
Android,not_removed,apparently it just clones the magstripe so yeah no tokenization the only things making it more secure than a standard card is the auto wipe and the fact that you need to validate payment and they seem to have developed their own take on mst but you just know samsung is gonna take a long look at their implementation if it becomes popular in the end it seems kinda gimmicky and really us specific but it seems to be successful so good for them
Android,not_removed,ive read their faq it doesnt they need the card physically present
Android,not_removed,yeah it looks like they found their own way to do the same thing so now youve got a choice for electronic wallets
Android,not_removed,faq says they are in talks with banks to do just that i personally wouldnt consider this product until they give some kind of partnership announcement i wont get it anyways because it wouldnt be of use to me but the concept is interesting imho
Android,not_removed,you may answer my question up vote
Android,not_removed,clones the mag strip well bring on the fraud people working in industries like resturants where they can dissapear with your card clone it into this gadget and go on a shopping spree at places that do not yet require chip enabled cards see there is a bit of code in the mag strip not targeted at you but for those who dont know that screams i have a chip on this card so places like target who have said if chip then do not allow mag strip are blocked from fraud those stores who have not forced chip can still swipe and be fraught with cloned cards cloning also works against credit unions and banks that have not put chips on cards even at places that require a chip like target because the cloned stripe does not have the bit of code so chip enforced readers allow a swipe
Android,not_removed,thank you for that info
Android,not_removed,i guess i spoke too soon we have been preparing for the emv shift since early this year we are currently in talk with banks and card issuers to support emv on spendwallet using tokenized mfe so yay potential bank support and yeah fraudulent magstripe cloning is already a big enough problem that this gadget will not make it worse
Android,not_removed,problem with atms and gas stations is the reader orientation its not possible to get the device close enough to the reader in dip terminals things like coin and stratus could do it because they actually fit the card form factor but theyre both bottom up plastc and swyp are the two upandcomers but i wouldnt hold my breath on those panning out
Android,not_removed,yeah ive read people inserting their drivers license then samsung pay works

Android,not_removed,they are something but not the only thing
Android,not_removed,benchmarks are important to prove that my phone is better than yours
Android,not_removed,maybe back when every device released within months or a year was miles ahead of the previous phone but that was back in like like the galaxy runs rings around the but right now the will keep up with the
Android,not_removed,i dont care at all long as its smooth
Android,not_removed,theyre mostly worthless its not an indication of real life usage of a device except for pretty obvious stuff like your benching faster than a budget phone
Android,not_removed,depends if your favourite phone wins than yes
Android,not_removed,no its just raw power in the end of the day how if it even can the phone utilizes that power is the big question
Android,not_removed,benchmarking is only useful for testing the full juice of the chipset to stress it to its limits also having an octocore processor doesnt really mean much
Android,not_removed,if youre not doing anything intensive no benchmark will really matter there are plenty of phones using the same cpu as the nexus that are sluggish in comparison to it however things like storage speed will be important when it comes to things like recording video taking pictures as well as app launch speeds beyond that benchmarks can provide a decent indication as to how a device might perform but its certainly not the whole story
Android,not_removed,i pay attention to them purely for fun but they dont affect my purchasing decision i know any device with snapdragon is going to be alright i check geekbench and transfer speed benchmarks however when some youtubber starts showing those lengthy benchmark comparisons i just skip them real world performance is is more important but even then in phonedogs test galaxy beat nexus by a good margin but id still get the over the
Android,not_removed,well a benchmark mostly tests how the phone behaves at maximum cpugpu load and therefore the upper limit of performance it can deliver the times the phone needs that much power are pretty rare fluidity is mostly due to software optimizing i would argue one way to put it is that benchmarks will only show you how smoothly you will be able to run games to give an example of a gpucpu intensive app
Android,not_removed,honestly from my experience is irrelevant there are so many factors its not even funny my lg gets different results on every room so software performance gets in the way of accurate hardware performance
Android,not_removed,ive owned an asus tablet in the past i really cant remember the name it was in the form factor of the nexus and it had some mediatek soc if i remember well long story short it was supposed to perform very well because it scored some really high scores especially in gaming where it scored higher then my old note which i had at the time clash of clans ran like crap on it xcom was super laggy and most games really werent very well optimised so in my experience no benchmark scores dont tell the full story imo its all about the software optimization
Android,not_removed,i think it doesnt matter much anymore now the problem is just battery life camera audio and how the phone feels over all and if the os isnt tainted at least zte and oneplus got the os stuff right
Android,not_removed,i think it doesnt matter much anymore now the problem is just battery life camera audio and how the phone feels over all and if the os isnt tainted at least zte and oneplus got the os stuff right
Android,not_removed,honeatly i could care less if the specs are years old as long as it runs smooth and plays everything who cares what the hell is under the hood honestly
Android,not_removed,snapdragon and can do anything the heaviest and worst coded android app will be pwned no matter what the only things above are not so much and and tegra are another story i even find it hard to use the power of my i could live with my previous phone with an antutu score of so this is like times more power android is past the age when mid range and high end hardware had humongous differences in real world usage now there is no difference atleast not with these two an ordinary user can even live with a sd
Android,not_removed,nope
Android,not_removed,not anymore i had my blu life one m with which scored on multicore on geekbench but the thing was it was really fast because it was on stock
Android,not_removed,not always you can say like the huawei could be destroyed by the in gpu but the chipset of the the kirin could sustain performance a lot longer before throttling imo its how u look at it
Android,not_removed,screen resolution and ram are factors people seem to overlook too i remember the version of the often being complained about because of performance issues if youre using a phone utilising a chip with of ram that is only using a screen itll probably be more than adequate performance wise for most use a screen instead and then youll probably start to see performance issues on those midrange chips benchmarks are fun way to compare devices thats all i see them as i wouldnt put too much weight into their scores but its nice seeing progress and especiallyseeing the gains in old budget series chips being able to step up and compete against old midrange chips like the vs ect
Android,not_removed,not the
Android,not_removed,i think the iphone has proven for quite sometme that raw benchmark results definitely do not equate to better performance ie the iphone tends to rate lower but performance is anything but
Android,not_removed,not when comparing a shitty galaxy sd with my redmi note pro sd the real world usage has a considerably big difference between my phone and flagship no real world difference my phone can pull off a fps on firefox and smooth hearthstone play says a lot
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,a nexus will keep up with an while yes mostly everything aside from the os is terrible hardware just doesnt age like it used to
Android,not_removed,so true
Android,not_removed,javascript performance is still fairly bad compared to based stuff its noticeable too on heavier websites its a lot more stuttery on krait devices than or kryo based ones id say javascript benchmarks are still definitely relevant to user experience with a margin of error of discomark is another good one and of course gpu benchmarks mainly ones testing sustained fps
Android,not_removed,actually iphones do fairly well in benchmarks especially singlethreaded tests
Android,not_removed,the iphone bests every other phone in majority of storage benchmarks and single threaded performance pair that with a lower resolution than most modern android phones you get an idea where it gets its fluidity and swiftness from software optimization also plays role
Android,not_removed,its funny you say that since apples twister cores are literally ahead of anything else right now in singlecore performance
Android,not_removed,uh i dont know where you get your benchmarks but iphones have been beating android phones pretty much always in single core by a good margin and then even or a little bit worse in multi core but dual core vs octo core deal is probably why
Android,not_removed,true
Android,not_removed,apart from battery life
Android,not_removed,because theyre staring to have to dig deeper and deeper for things to whine about now that phones are almost all great now and on par with each other in like of aspects so true the only thing imo that sets them apart nowadays read the only thing i care about is low light camera performance
Android,not_removed,because theyre staring to have to dig deeper and deeper for things to whine about now that phones are almost all great now actually it is still the exact same trouble as in too much touch latency too many dropped frames batterylife is complete crapshoot updates dont reach customers all got a bit better but all four are extremely basic features that desperately need improvement the development of android phones has been disapointing unless you are the instagram kid praising that the camera is not complete crap any more
Android,not_removed,color accuracy is not really a niche feature every phone should have an srgb and an accurate display
Android,not_removed,think of it like intel vs amd lots of weak cores vs a few strong ones
Android,not_removed,hell yeah
Android,not_removed,not really i prefer design and camera
Android,not_removed,fuck that
Android,not_removed,you mean water resistance
Android,not_removed,its pretty damn water proof man
Android,not_removed,how do i word this correctly then obviously a lot of people are gonna get a lot out of this question
Android,not_removed,i think the audience in this sub is beyond the technical knowledge of how to tether an android phone useful for someones grandparents though im sure
Android,not_removed,wow
Android,not_removed,im gonna preemptively approve this one so i dont have to deal with more edit why is that i cant set reminders on either this or on alexa likethats one thing i really want hey its pm you asked to be reminded about throwing dog poop at your girlfriend
Android,not_removed,god damnit triggered my google home like three times haha
Android,not_removed,could someone explain to me the benefits to getting one if you dont have a smart home it just seems like my phone could easily do everything a google home could do and more
Android,not_removed,why should i get this instead of an echo dot for echo is much more usefu
Android,not_removed,probably not
Android,not_removed,i honestly think its worth it right now its a fun little gadget but in the future it will be able to do so much more
Android,not_removed,is hey google now an accepted phrase or is it just for google home mkbhd seems to be using it often instead of the usual ok google here
Android,not_removed,i saw that it was at best buy with visa checkout yesterday decided to pass on it i dont see a use for it yet in my everyday life
Android,not_removed,i want one of these but i have no idea what id even use it for my apartment is far from smart
Android,not_removed,i am getting exact same vibes about this product like it happened during google glass many people were excited about that tech cause it looked like future but soon the novelty of having one worn off really fast and actually became overbearing later on
Android,not_removed,early bird gets the worm and all that
Android,not_removed,mine would restart the video when marques said ok google play the latest mkbhd video on the tv lool
Android,not_removed,i had to mute the mic on mine because i just knew it would respond
Android,not_removed,at the next google io i want someone to go up to the microphone and say ok google
Android,not_removed,we dont have a smart home gh was a replacement for my wifes broken bluetooth speaker primarily but its proven to be more she has it in the kitchen and uses it for quick measurement conversions shes a chef it also does language conversions really well and with a german exchange student coming in a few months and us only knowing a little german itll likely come in handy she also uses it to play music now rather than having to use her phone and its just fun the kids are having a good time having it tell then jokes and do funny things thatll wear off eventually im sure but for now now its cool its nothing we have to have right now but i think its brining enough value to be worth it especially given wed have spent replacing her speaker anyway so why not get a smart speaker for a bit more ok like twice as much but still edit yes your phone can basically do all of this but having it always available is nice plus this thing picks up your voice from an unbelievable distance away with walls between you and it and it recognizes natural speech shockingly well all of it works better than any of our phones do to me if you see any value in google nowassistant generally then youd love how much better the gh works it really is amazing
Android,not_removed,i have an echo dot its useful in setting small reminders timers etc alexa set a timer for seconds plus there are some good cooking skills for alexa alexa is really useful for playing music and in kitchen plus for my morning briefing its not as useful right now as it would maybe be in years to be fair
Android,not_removed,it just seems like my phone could easily do everything a google home could do and more yeah but then you have to take out your phone i know that doesnt egregious but think about how many swipes and taps it would take to start your phone playing a specific song on an external speaker vs just calling out the name to an always listening home so yes unless you have home automation in place the home probably doesnt do anything that your phone doesnt and your phone does even more on top but its all about convenience whether thats worth or not is up to you i love it but i have smartthings setup so thats a big uniquetothehome vs a phone i know echo also does this feature that most wont have
Android,not_removed,because you use other google services like gmail and calendar and want to buy into the future dream of an assistant that leverages knowledge from all those things instead of an assistant that mostly knows what you buy online
Android,not_removed,coz the dot has a crappy speaker and needs additional speakers to play music echo and dot dont have multiroom music streaming if you have a chromecastandroidtv home can play videos on demand on your tv
Android,not_removed,the echo dot is a better deal if you already have a pair of speakers to pair it with it isnt really an all in one solution the way the standard echo is
Android,not_removed,ill buy it when its cheaper and can do more then
Android,not_removed,and in the future are also likely be cheaper im all for getting a google home but i just dont think theyre worth it right now unless you have home automation products to go with it
Android,not_removed,i think thats the fallacy we tend to believe with google products they dont add new features they create a version of it and add it then i want to buy the google home but i dont find it necessary and i know the features i want most google account integration wont come for a long time if at all on the google home
Android,not_removed,only for home
Android,not_removed,okay google is only syllables and yet it feels like an absolute mouthful i really dislike that phrase
Android,not_removed,it probably just sounds enough like okay google people on rgooglehome are always finding things that work for them some times even better like okay poophole
Android,not_removed,i remembered i could do that about half way through the video
Android,not_removed,google turns off the beep in the google app before a big event like io
Android,not_removed,sweet this is an exciting idea my only downside is that ill want multiple for the different rooms in my house i was thinking one as an alarmbriefing device in my room one in the kitchen for the reason you stated with conversions and one in the living room to control my chromecast but thats quite a lot of cash maybe they will come out with a cheaper version though it seems worth the cost
Android,not_removed,seems like the trend of these cool new ideas the smart home assistant and even vr and smart watches really seem cool now but i certainly see then being a vital part of our life in a few years
Android,not_removed,hmm thanks that makes sense really just for that extra convenience it seems worth the as opposed to for a new phone i dont even use bluetooth on my phone because it was too much work when i could just plug in aux but maybe the home would be a better solution
Android,not_removed,so buy an echo dot now and a google home in years
Android,not_removed,buying on what it could be isnt very promising seeing googles track record of shelving things that didnt work out
Android,not_removed,its not integrated into gmail at the moment btw
Android,not_removed,alexa is getting sonos integration which should cover the multi room music thing
Android,not_removed,the echo looks like something taken from the tron universe this is a bad thing oo
Android,not_removed,i mean it was over black fridaycyber monday im not sure how much cheaper it can get
Android,not_removed,dont expect cheaper than echo has been around for years
Android,not_removed,because theyre not releasing the api until december just wait once developers have access to it i have a feeling people are going to come up with some awesome things
Android,not_removed,its generally wise never to buy a generation of any product the good stuff always comes with a duration beyond
Android,not_removed,the home is mostly the same hardware as the second gen chromecasts just with a touch panel and speaker added but its the same chipset the home itself is mostly just a dummy terminal it listens for your voice it can load the chromecast webapps to play music it can join chromecast audio speaker groups and it can initiate casts on another chromecast thats about the full extent of it all the magic happens in googles datacenters so in the same way that all the chromecasts get all the new features since most of them are features on the services not on the device the home will get any updates and improvements made to the assistant just by virtue of its connection to the assistant
Android,not_removed,doesnt work on my but works on my home
Android,not_removed,its listed in the home app as a usable phrase
Android,not_removed,yeah thats my problem my kids want their own now id suggest picking up one and giving it a try you will i think be surprised by the range shocked actually i can control my chromecast sitting on the couch with the gh in the kitchen about feet away with a thick plaster wall between us it hears me just fine not yelling or anything it probably wouldnt cover an entire averagesized house but you may not need more than two
Android,not_removed,hey maybe it will be able to read rcs messages by then
Android,not_removed,well in years google home will be cancelled product
Android,not_removed,totally fair which is why i pointed out that this is ultimately an act of faith im bullish on google for this project though although i understand of others remain skeptical for now
Android,not_removed,i said future dream but even that said as you can get your flight information from google home which is scraped from your gmail its actually technically true as well
Android,not_removed,sonos stuff is expensive though op was concerned about difference between the echo dot and home
Android,not_removed,with a brief visa checkout promotion 😁
Android,not_removed,plus giftcard that ive had laying around instabuy
Android,not_removed,im excited to make a purchase because you have a feeling
Android,not_removed,there are a shitton of devs with early access actually stuff will be out very soon
Android,not_removed,i think that might be true siri has become a heck of a lot more useful now that i can access stuff
Android,not_removed,right but it doesnt do some things it should know how to do like check things in your google keep calendar gmail basically any google product plus the fact that its only tied to one account and it probably wont get an update to fix these issues its really disappointing i like google products considering ive had almost all of the nexus products and the chromecasts but ive come to learn than they will only give limited support and usually no new features on their hardware they just put it on later versions and call it innovation and make some excuse why it cant be implemented on previous versions
Android,not_removed,yeah ill do that it seems like it will be a good addition and it may cause me to upgrade to a phillips hue and a nest thermostat haha
Android,not_removed,dead on arrival
Android,not_removed,just like chromecast
Android,not_removed,yeah i think its kind of dumb that the top of the white echo dot isnt white
Android,not_removed,pulled the trigger when that promo came up i dont really need one i already have an echo i guess i have a price after all sold
Android,not_removed,thats what i did plus of youtube and google music free thats bucks saved for me so i got it for after its all said and done
Android,not_removed,then dont no one is making you buy it
Android,not_removed,im sure thats googles plan
Android,not_removed,the best way to opt out of verizon appflash is to not use verizon
Android,not_removed,i compiled this list of verizoncompatible unlocked phones for anyone interested nexus nexus nexus moto x pure moto plus play moto plus samsung galaxy and us snapdragon unlocked and samsung galaxy and us unlocked i dont know the model numbers but you can get them from best buy lg us unlocked zte axon not officially supported google pixel and pixel xl any iphone from the onwards except for the atttmobile version of the iphone and
Android,not_removed,i hate canadian carriers with a passion but not if they would dare try and pull this bullshit that verizon is doing like honestly what are you doing verizon
Android,not_removed,no you can limit what they collect but as long as youre using verizon youre getting your data collectedtracked absolutely terrible call on verizons part
Android,not_removed,opt out is bullshit too many companies put the onus on customers most of have no idea weve been forced into some bullshit scheme in the first place if we have to opt out of every scumbag scheme every corporation we ever deal with forces on us then well waste hours on end trying to track it all down and trying to get a real person on the phone to make sure were really opted out and half the time the opt out doesnt even work how about we make it a crime for corporations to opt us in to anything without our consent and if they do it they get a minimum of ten years in jail
Android,not_removed,the fact that it exists in the first place makes it wrong and yeah you can opt out with their opt out feature but the spyware still exists on your device and at any time they can choose to enable it without you knowing the fact that they have that power is wrong in itselfand i get that all your data traffic goes through them anyways but at least you have the option of using a vpn if youre currently on verizon and for whatever reason dont feel like leaving theres also the ability to use a custom rom for further protection a more trusted rom
Android,not_removed,i wish i had that option they are the only reliable carrier where i live
Android,not_removed,ill probably get downvoted but google does the same thing and people still use it as long as there is a way to opt out i dont see the issue if its something i can completely disable im not gonna fuss about it
Android,not_removed,or used an unlocked phone on verizon
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,ive tried bringing an unlocked pixel xl bought via google fi and i could not use it on verizon while maybe the employees i talked to were incompetent in my experience you cant use unlocked pixels on verizon
Android,not_removed,do unlocked phones get updates faster too
Android,not_removed,if you dont buy your phone though verizon it wont be on your phone
Android,not_removed,custom rom verizon its like youre some benevolent alien whos come to earth to help us after seeing this news but unfortunately have no idea what verizon actually is or does they locked the bootloader on the pixel googles own developer phone its not likely custom roms will be a feasible way out of this for people on verizon
Android,not_removed,the difference is google provides free services by ads we pay verizon for a service this isnt needed
Android,not_removed,you agree to let google use information it learns about you in exchange for using their services you pay verizon for phone service and they just take information and sell it to third parties with no benefit to you so not the same thing
Android,not_removed,yeah those employees are incompetent you should just be able to insert an activated sim and go
Android,not_removed,some do the nexus and pixel phones are the first to get android updates
Android,not_removed,obviously the best way some people just refuse to leave verizon though most people dont follow their phone company in the news and have little care as long as their signal is good
Android,not_removed,yeah we all know that but the majority of people who dont roam around randroid and buy their phone straight from carriers dont know that its not easy to convince someone who doesnt really care much about this stuff to go pay full price for a phone off amazon or something instead of paying a month from verizon thats the problem here not the of knowledgable phone users that randroid makes up verizon knows that and thats why this is a thing in the first place
Android,not_removed,oh i agree its absolutely not needed if it were mandatory id be switching services in a heartbeat id like to switch on principal but thats just too much of a hassle for me even if i do whats to say all major carriers dont follow suit ill be buying the unlocked from best buy regardless
Android,not_removed,where i live thats the only way to have any signal in my neighborhood id love to vote with my wallet and be a progressive consumer and all but if i wanted a phone i could only use on a wifi network id just get a tablet
Android,not_removed,i think he meant use verizon but dont buy a phone from them you can get pixels galaxy ses iphones etc straight from the manufacturer and use them on verizon and not have any verizon bloatware installed
Android,not_removed,dev said its not exclusive to verizon wait till he sells it to your carier
Android,not_removed,you know you can also buy your phones unlocked and use them on verizon right
Android,not_removed,and when it comes to tmobile ill just use a custom rom lol
Android,not_removed,yeah thats what im gonna do but the person i replied to said something about just not using verizon i wish i could

Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,or usually
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,ms so i dont accidentally long press shit all the time
Android,not_removed,is the sweet spot
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,im at because i feel anything above that is too slow
Android,not_removed,i need speeeed
Android,not_removed,anything higher and i feel like i have to wait around too long
Android,not_removed,if im not tapping it its a hold been that way for years
Android,not_removed,moved it to that and have kept it that way i find that i type faster than my keyboard will register some times so its annoying
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,in google keyboard swype i had the faster the better for me i guess i just have good coordination and up and i wanna kill myself im though ill bet its gonna get adjusted upwards very soon
Android,not_removed,thats the sweetspot for me
Android,not_removed,because im too lazy to change it
Android,not_removed,the lowest lets me type extremely fast
Android,not_removed,touchwiz wont let you go below seconds it has three preset settings
Android,not_removed,yep
Android,not_removed,you can always download a different keyboard
Android,not_removed,i went with it because that was usually my preferred delay setting for my guitar effects for years and i guess i have the muscle memory for the timing now

Android,not_removed,lol iphone edge
Android,not_removed,theres even a food mode for those terrible people lol
Android,not_removed,looks like well also be seeing after the buzz type videos with michael too cant wait
Android,not_removed,enjoyed the video a lot has a type of polish that i havent seen on any other channel more akin to a tv show i felt like i was watching a how its made type show at least presentation wise
Android,not_removed,wait michael fisher is back
Android,not_removed,best reviewer period
Android,not_removed,i hope anand tech can get their part out soon at least before the release of note its better that way since most components would only be better or identical
Android,not_removed,i was just saying this the other day and the only thing missing for me was an ir to control my ac and tv
Android,not_removed,lol
Android,not_removed,for most ppl hes right but like most reviewers videos his opinions serve me no purpose locked bootloader automatic no importing a exynos is a no i wont support a company that refuses to release unlocked simbootloader phones in the us any longer
Android,not_removed,i really like his intro music
Android,not_removed,someone is apart of the notification squad
Android,not_removed,oh ffs when a reviewer has to begin hisher intro by explaining that the in the name stands for the iteration that tab gets closed fucking idiot
Android,not_removed,i do what i must because i can
Android,not_removed,hey who said that and where
Android,not_removed,yep they have a few videos up
Android,not_removed,absolutely he makes better videos than the verge mkbhd androidpolice android authority etc only other person i can say deserves this high praise for different reasons is erica griffin
Android,not_removed,i agree i test phones for my job so i go through so many one of the most underrated and underutilized features are ir blasters the amount of fun i had messing with people was staggering the amount of time i saved searching for the remote worth its weight in gold all that being said still the best smartphone you can get currently imo
Android,not_removed,httpinceptiondavepeducomnoflashphp
Android,not_removed,that has more to do with the selection of the android phone market than the laziness of the author that said this is probably a western centric video maybe even us where many of the phones that are missing are either expensive to import or incompatible with local networks
Android,not_removed,its definitely uscentric which is understandable since its michael fisher theres a small note about the processor which was showed as snapdragon exynos in some markets when its actually the exynos model thats in more markets than the sd model us china japan only everyone else gets exynos
Android,not_removed,what about when the note comes out which will be the iteration of the note series
Android,not_removed,hes not an idiot hes a great reviewer with a long history of good work
Android,not_removed,who pissed in your cereal this morning
Android,not_removed,did someone hurt you as a child
Android,not_removed,r u ok
Android,not_removed,for the good of all of us except the ones that are dead
Android,not_removed,somewhat on topic but what is up with the automatic tags theyre far too inaccurate anything with a gnumber gets tagged as lg anything with note as samsung anything with znumber as sony etc not to mention tags are missing for major oems like xiaomi
Android,not_removed,watch the review and find out
Android,not_removed,food photography mode around
Android,not_removed,they is he working with other people
Android,not_removed,he makes better videos than the verge mkbhd androidpolice android authority etc yes that is the definition of best
Android,not_removed,he doesnt come close to mkbhd in terms of production quality
Android,not_removed,or the next iphone iphone which also wont be the iteration or google weird and lets not act like phone companies know how to count
Android,not_removed,assholes doing fluff reviews that waste time explaining what release numbers are and blathering on about irrelevant bullshit and nebulous claims like exudes refinement get to the fucking point specs performance features
Android,not_removed,daddy issues i guess
Android,not_removed,but theres no sense crying over every update that works for randroid
Android,not_removed,ill bring it up with other mods to see if we can fix it i realised that too
Android,not_removed,fukn clickbait bullshit my uncle is xda and hell ban you
Android,not_removed,pretty sure he is just mocking people who always pull a quote from whatever it may be article video who knows and just add lol or haha to it
Android,not_removed,hes under mobile nations but hes got a lot of free reign
Android,not_removed,mkbhd videos are beautiful looking and sounding but his reviews have been meh
Android,not_removed,but specs performance and features were of the video if a second blurb about the version number is enough to get you to completely write it off i feel you may need to start reassessing things
Android,not_removed,why is he an asshole because you someone thats acting like an asshole say so
Android,not_removed,lmao
Android,not_removed,what how would you even get to that conclusion
Android,not_removed,well just keep on trying til we run out of cake
Android,not_removed,aha thanks
Android,not_removed,yeah his videos nowadays dont come close in terms of quality content to what he did back the the galaxy days
Android,not_removed,iunno
Android,not_removed,and the compile gets done and you make a neat rom for device trees that are still alive
Android,not_removed,hey you could post this over at randroidquestions to have it answered cheers
Android,not_removed,just posted there thank you
Android,not_removed,cheers matey no problem

Android,not_removed,this is so clickbait no comparing to note or note ux refinement may be the most important thing samsung can do to attract the android power users if this phone gets monthly updates like the combined with the killer specs and front facing flash people will snatch this up spen based gif cut and paste is a long time dream of mine i will get it just for that reason alone i wonder if the gear vr will have many new features also if this phone never overheats in vr then that is the killer feature
Android,not_removed,the note will be to the note what the was to the that is take an already good phone as a starting point and fix what went wrong with the previous version the note is already a good phone so they dont have to do much to make it a great phone just like how the little refinements they did to the to make the made the such a great overall device for a lot of users
Android,not_removed,iris scanning is a pretty nice unique feature as far as design language why fix something that isnt broke they complained about the being plastic they praised the for glass samsung realized that and continued that build for note and then everyone complains because its not original what are they supposed to do next metal wood concrete they also cant use a new processor especially when there isnt even a new one out ram yea its disappointing thats its only but thats because were accustomed to the oneplus praise atleast samsung is giving us a base option of i mean its not as much as rebinning old parts as it is not having access to future parts plus find another phone with a display as pocketable as the edge the bezelscreen ratio is insane i cant help it the note doesnt have a year battery life and an what else are they supposed to do to innovate moto mods and thats a niche market we already seen ara and its rough bumpy start i just feel like the writer of this article expected too much from the note rumors and was disappointed when rumors didnt quite come out as expected
Android,not_removed,the hate for this phone has started before it even launches makes me wonder if reviewers get paid by competitor companies to write these kinds of articles
Android,not_removed,what else are they going to do spec and design wise with current tech as far as i can tell the will appeal to current note owners and people with massive phones like nexus and iphone
Android,not_removed,i have two questions you think the note will have a theme store i miss being able to change my theme every week and look at new ones on my have a micro sd card that lg gave me for my will it work in the note
Android,not_removed,i actually dont mind if its somewhat iterative this is a catchup year when they are tweaking and perfecting the flaws from previous years usbc bringing back sd storage etc if they had taken a great leap forward in design then probably we would have seen sacrifices on functionality and other gaps
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,did i miss something didnt the note release last year and now the note are they skipping to stay in line with the s series
Android,not_removed,stupid article is stupid
Android,not_removed,i think is a worthy big brother to edge was just a beast by samsung spoiling us
Android,not_removed,thats the last time i read anything by android authority
Android,not_removed,does anyone have info on its storage will it sport nvme 🦄🙏 i hope so 😓
Android,not_removed,a lot of people in this thread seem to be missing the point and are pointing out how the note is an improvement over the the note will surely be better than the note because the latter is a phone from last year the question is is it better than the edge a phone thats mostly the same spec wise and almost certainly cheaper except it has a slightly smaller battery and larger screenwhich is not a great tradeoff for most the software could be innovative and optimized but since the specs are so similar it doesnt excite because samsung could just issue an update for new ui and better power efficiency when the software is a big selling point for the note you also sure as hell wont get it on the because samsung wouldnt want to cannibalize its own sales nb what i also find worrying is that some are hyping note over because it has usb c while the same crowds tone was meh micro usb is just fine thanks back in february zealous loyalty to a firm hurts the customer most because it allows them to cut corners without consequence
Android,not_removed,its not out yet
Android,not_removed,the note seems pretty solid i wish the battery was bigger im a big power user and mah wont get me through the day oh well looks look im buying another zerolemon battery case if i choose to get this phone
Android,not_removed,they dont want to be branded as gimmick anymore
Android,not_removed,id be interested if they brought back all the features the old notes have along with what was great before ir blaster removable battery micro sd front facing speakers waterproof etc make this phone have what is missing in all the other ones and i will buy this day one some people might like an iris scanner just seems like a gimmick to me
Android,not_removed,only thing i think they slipped up on is the of ram but i think samsung is realizing that people arent upgrading anymore every year a year old phone still works for most people and its even more tempting to skip generations when they are asking for a flagship so they wont be giving us ahead of the curve specs that will let the phone live beyond its intended one year life cycle besides that i dont like the curved edges but thats not a matter of being lazy still waiting to see what the final word is re qcenyxos chips but i think thats more driven by the fees to get qc cdma modems
Android,not_removed,i guess my only complaint would be the battery yes its sufficient enough absolutely but relative to the edge the capacity should be larger why does a larger device have a smaller battery when its made by the same manufacturer sure you have to fit the spen in but given the sales of the edge the market has voted that higher battery capacity is what theyre looking for
Android,not_removed,so the note had also identical insides to the s but a smaller battery that makes no sense
Android,not_removed,was samsung ever not lazy
Android,not_removed,as mentionsd elsewhere its essentially a galaxy edge with a stylus iris scanner and a smaller battery this being the biggest wtf nothing to get the too excited about people expected more a new soc being chief of those expectations and maybe a new camera canera was rumoured a while back if youve got a current flagship phone youd be mad to pay the £ or more than note will launch at
Android,not_removed,samsung can do to attract the android power users the thing is why would samsung cater to power users when they can just cater to a larger more easily pleasing audience last year they prioritized shiny over functional and it turned out great for them regardless of the few rants on tech sites
Android,not_removed,it doesnt have a front facing flash unless it does what apple does with the screen itself being the flash
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,well europe had never seen the note everything here is new for them as far as the note series is concerned
Android,not_removed,i would love a concrete phone
Android,not_removed,since when is of ram disappointing if ios can multitask better with of ram then clearly our problem isnt not enough ram is completely fine anything higher is overkill of ram is how much my computer has a phone right now does not need anymore
Android,not_removed,im so sick of all the rumors and websites pitching their two cents about something that isnt official yet its better to just ignore it all than to feed into any of it
Android,not_removed,iris scanning is a pretty nice unique feature unless you wear glasses or contacts
Android,not_removed,the has crazy small bezels at
Android,not_removed,at least the base model is does this not drive up the price i would never need more than with an sd card and would rather get a cheaper version
Android,not_removed,the bezelscreen ratio is insane according to phone arena its high but not mindblowing high lots of phones are on huawei mate is on alcatel onetouch hero is on sharp aquos crystal unfortunately there doesnt seem to be a way to sort by so i just clicked on a few that had great ratio httpwwwphonearenacomphonessortrevratingdisplaygreatscreentobodyratio
Android,not_removed,what else are they supposed to do to innovate removable battery it doesnt change much for those who dont care about it it changes everything for those who do it helps ewaste a lot in the longterm if all phones had that i mean were talking about many millions phones of every year
Android,not_removed,did this write up get it right that the note has a smaller battery than the if so it makes no sense its got a bigger chassis and virtually the same insides youd think it would have bigger cell or the same at least so this guy is going to have a lower off charger life then the these devices are meant to be mobile that means i need a minimum of hours of charger with normal use i wish manufacturers would stop eeking every millimeter off of the device at the cost is battery id gladly take a note a few millimeter thicker so i knew i could go all day no matter what im doing without needing a charge fast charging is great but id rather not have to charge to get through the rest of my day
Android,not_removed,i dont think you understand what is the difference between the edge and the note pretty much nothing why get a note when you can get the before this year the difference was size the notes were much larger than the s now its not and before the note the processor was a big upgrade
Android,not_removed,nope just that the android community as other tech enthusiast communities are full of whiny people complaining about poitless stuff so mediocre journalism pops up to feed off that attitude its still a shitty moneygrab from tech sites
Android,not_removed,honestly the has never felt massive to me im desensitized now but using my feels so small now
Android,not_removed,with samsung pushing vr i figured they would use a screen
Android,not_removed,yes to both
Android,not_removed,some drastic exciting changes are apparently coming to the theme engine as well
Android,not_removed,yup great decision on their side if you ask me edit dont downvote questions you assholes
Android,not_removed,glass is slippery and shatters on impact not a great combination also glass backs seem to come with a construction that makes the not so easy to replace
Android,not_removed,in regards to battery they have a pen that has to fit inside the case
Android,not_removed,what do you hate about it
Android,not_removed,itll be ufs like all their high end phones have had since last year possibly duallane which will blow current nvme used in phones out of the water sequential reads on samsungs new chips even their new ufs memory cards can reach sequential write with the version
Android,not_removed,dual land ufs allegedly which is faster
Android,not_removed,front facing speakers waterproof none of the notes have had those right
Android,not_removed,do you really think gigs of ram is going to become a limiting factor at all during the note lifetime phones are still being made with gigs my nexus has gigs and it shows that my average memory used is i really dont think gigs is going to be inhibitive
Android,not_removed,hell i have a note and im ready to upgrade but this phone still runs fine stock and better with a custom rom i have already gone through two batteries and really see little need to get another plus though if i can get a buy get one free i will probably get an
Android,not_removed,but given the sales of the edge the market has voted that higher battery capacity is what theyre looking for are there actual numbers for the sales available even if the actually outsells the regular by a huge market i dont think thats enough to confirm that market has voted that higher battery capacity is what theyre looking for i mean i could argue that it was the bigger screen or the looks and it would be just as valid as your statement
Android,not_removed,the doesnt have a stylus to house
Android,not_removed,it also makes no difference since this will sell like hotcakes just as every other note device edit alright so when i say this but with iphone instead of notes i get upvotes but no samsung costumers are way more critical and rigorous right
Android,not_removed,the battery is smaller get a grip
Android,not_removed,the battery is smaller get a grip
Android,not_removed,this is not the people who bought the edge its for people coming from the note and
Android,not_removed,i am not trying to say they are marketing the note toward just that if they did those things would be a good way to do it you are right the trend is to combine the s line and note line into one on the i am just saying power users might use a note more often if the note got updates and a more usable ui
Android,not_removed,all these sites say so many different things i am so ready for the phone to drop
Android,not_removed,how so
Android,not_removed,phone slips out of hand whoops i broke the hardwood floor
Android,not_removed,its called a nokia
Android,not_removed,i want a carbon fiber model thats aero
Android,not_removed,gb is enough to run windows on a full featured computer and run a lot of programs simultaneously if its not enough for android on a phone then something is seriously wrong either with android or the apps or both for one thing app devs need to remember they are writing for an embedded environment and not a server farm
Android,not_removed,you may be right although i do want to point out that your comparing apples to oranges you cant say because ios can do it so should android they are so different when it comes to the software that they run
Android,not_removed,if ios can multitask better with of ram then clearly our problem isnt not enough ram ios cant it just multi tasks different and more limited but this discussion happened multiple times already just google it edit is disappointing because there were rumors of it using and other devices are also starting to use more than would allow the device to keep for most usage cases nearly all apps opened within a session in ram avoiding to load assets again when reopening stuff this would drastically decrease load times when starting apps especially stuff like your browser that needs to load content from the internet which can take multiple seconds when not on wifi for most users it would also mean a slight decrease in power consumption is disappointing just in the same way are disappointing its not bad at all still high end and better than of the phones out there but its disappointing when a top of the line flagship device from the biggest android oem isnt stepping up the game with better specs than the half year old on top of that ios feels really ram limited including closing browser tabs while using the browser with only
Android,not_removed,since the launch is just days away most of the people involved in the industry already have their devices in stock as well as the bloggersjournalists who have their review devices in hand for a day review article of course they wouldnt upfront confirm the specs because of ndas but believe me the devices is already out there in the wild with all the features already disseminated to the proper channels
Android,not_removed,they have to generate clicks somehow speculation articles are a huge traffic driver
Android,not_removed,had smaller bezels
Android,not_removed,storage prices have never been about the cost of the parts but to split the demand we call that price discrimination and it happens in basically every industry so probably the base would be equivalent to last years
Android,not_removed,if those were an objective and complete list then it would just be the entire sharp lineup for the last years dammit sharp get out of japan and give those nice bezels to the world
Android,not_removed,it doesnt change much for those who dont care about it except you know you have to redesign the whole internal and part of the external layout to accomodate the removable battery and accound for extra parts and healthy heat management but yeah no biggie
Android,not_removed,its only a slightly larger chassis than the which granted the spen chamber does take up a large portion of internal space but as far as thickness i completely agree i think the build quality of a thicker phone just feels more quality and sturdy plus the added benefit of cramming a larger cell is always welcomed in my eyes
Android,not_removed,you do know samsung already did this right the and edge are thicker than the devices they replaced and that thickness is filled out mostly with bigger battery
Android,not_removed,good point aside from sony do any phones have display
Android,not_removed,source
Android,not_removed,did you guys manage to find out info on the storage specs so is it duallane udcresistance
Android,not_removed,i doubt it nvme can hit read speeds of
Android,not_removed,im honestly curious how of ram in a phone would make it not as great android in its current form is not really something that screams oh i need of ram in my phone
Android,not_removed,thats the thing it wont be a hindrance so many people whining about not including at least and that the battery is gasp less then the is quite agitating maybe the new note has a more efficient screen using a new battery technology or whatever rumors are wind until finally confirmed by samsung
Android,not_removed,hell i am still on a note the is a big jump up for me regardless i dont like the sealed battery but ill live with it as long as i get my sd slot
Android,not_removed,it was estimated they sold million by the end of june with over half being the edge
Android,not_removed,its supposed to be a premium phone compared to the
Android,not_removed,the point is that the price gives the impression it is going to be all new but actually it isnt its nearly £ more expensive than the edge while having the same internals
Android,not_removed,yup its just a matter of cost benefit of implementing said features however i dont think both lines will converge since keeping the lines separate is a good way to split the demand and get more profits
Android,not_removed,haha i know it samsung has their reps that visit places that sell samsung like carrier stores so weve all seen it
Android,not_removed,do we have a date on when its supposed to come out
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,phone slips out of hand whoops i broke the hardwood floor my foot
Android,not_removed,wouldnt a concrete phone shatter on a fall unless they make it bricksized that is
Android,not_removed,rtifu
Android,not_removed,ever since dbrand carbon skins i see carbon fiber as very gaudy and tacky its just too nfs underground for me
Android,not_removed,to makes matters worse runs passably on those cheap tablets with sure you wont be running photoshop with raws open while working on your pet autocad project but it works memory management on android is just really really really bad also need to mention it works if you dont use chrome edge works smoothly while chrome eats everything you throw at it or gb funny thing that tho
Android,not_removed,to be fair the handling of ram and applications on windows and android are very different windows will cache applications in ram to the hard drive to free up system ram for new processes whereas android doesnt im not saying this from the context of not being enough but on android may not go nearly as far as in windows
Android,not_removed,i know that but we should try to maximize our ram management first before we just add more ram to it its plain obvious that ram management can be so much better just adding more ram wont fix the fundamental problem
Android,not_removed,i definitely think you can say that especially when a much more powerful operating system can run with less than in windows android is just bad at ram management
Android,not_removed,um no android has a major ram management issue and the only fix is better software guess what every oem does to fix it throw more ram at it you can have of ram on an android superphone in a few years and it will still manage the ram worse than ios with
Android,not_removed,that phrase dont make no sense why cant fruit be compared
Android,not_removed,when you have running on as well things start to point towards android just being bad and not a mere applesoranges
Android,not_removed,well you can still compare nutrition values between oranges and apples and with the current technology they can modify oranges to match a lot of the nutritions in apples
Android,not_removed,remember kids use the fucking search button before commenting
Android,not_removed,ram uses battery a fair amount of it actually whether or not its being used the more ram you have onboard the more power it uses period throwing ram at a problem is the least powerefficient way to do things
Android,not_removed,tldr android has a serious ram management issue and the fix is to not throw more ram at the problem memory leaks for example completely ignore the amount of ram in the system it will just consume ram until the os is forced to shutdown due to insufficient system resources android does not need of ram it needs better ram management software period
Android,not_removed,yeah theyre also to blame if theyre throwing garbage articles out as well
Android,not_removed,i love the ability of a removable battery and i suspect most here do but you are dead on
Android,not_removed,sonys the only one i know of but the screen on the is ips maybe samsung cant do amoled at that size or too pricey edit theyve already done it high demand for them
Android,not_removed,themers who are currently under nda so there are no more details
Android,not_removed,yeah but its only mm wider and thats less then the thickness of the pen
Android,not_removed,i dont believe it is
Android,not_removed,it can but the stuff in the only runs at read the dual lane ufs is meant to be about
Android,not_removed,hell i am still on a note frankly not sure if i really want to upgrade due to smaller battery than and only gigs of ram its mostly because the set the gb margin that it feels a bit meh dont really want to get the either due to micro usb oh the plight of phones
Android,not_removed,right right but that doesnt mean the people have spoken about battery capacity sure most people on this sub chose the over the flat because of battery capacity but there are a plethora of other reasons to prefer the edge version so this is not conclusive
Android,not_removed,its an with a larger screen and spen and iris scanner what else do you want them to add already has top notch specs
Android,not_removed,that is your problem here and many other folks as well you should not be comparing it to the this is not an upgrade to that phone nor should it be targeted to those users the note is an upgrade to the note that is where the comparisons should be
Android,not_removed,that makes good marketing sense and business sense i wonder if a combined line could ever sell as many units as both of them separately
Android,not_removed,rumor is tmobile aug
Android,not_removed,i dunno i think nes to snes would be more like note to note but i hear what youre saying
Android,not_removed,my phone is just ok though so satisfied with my purchase
Android,not_removed,yeah bricksized is what i meant
Android,not_removed,itd also be the one phone to fail a key based scratch test
Android,not_removed,memory management on android is just really really really bad id like to clarify that default oem memory management on adnroid is very bad basically any custom rom multitasks better than the stock rom even when you factor in the instability it adds so frequently its just messed up lowmemorykiller parameters and i really cant understand how this keeps happening on so many devices
Android,not_removed,but i will be paying more than if one plus can do it why not samsung
Android,not_removed,win pro can reliably but slowly run on of ram
Android,not_removed,windows is miserable on is a joke
Android,not_removed,bear in mind youre not comparing like for like manufacturers on mobile are pulling base bs on ram while laptop and desktop are not so youre getting less ram than you think on mobile
Android,not_removed,sure theres no disk cache and thats a factor i run linux on even gb of ram with no cache though and i can still run things better than android does
Android,not_removed,agreed
Android,not_removed,this is one of the things that baffles me how oems can still get this wrong most of the times all moto gs xiaomis you just tweak some lowmemorykiller parameters and poof youre done this is one of those rare cases where the community does know better and oems just miss the correct setup while winning nothing from it
Android,not_removed,the fuck
Android,not_removed,well they have to pretend they dont know anything about it
Android,not_removed,oh cool i havent seen that screen but only nits brightness has been registered at and is very close maybe that is the issue
Android,not_removed,so what thats also theoretical do you have proof that the mobile version can hit those speeds im talking about theoretical speeds just like you but i have first hand experience that my samsung evo can hit read speeds
Android,not_removed,and yet most big box retailers were all sold out of battery banks for weeks after pokémon go came out people want battery life people need battery life to have a smaller or equally comparable battery to the series in a larger device is a disappointment
Android,not_removed,note has always had better specs not just an with a pen
Android,not_removed,my main point is the note always seemed to be a step above the sx of the same generation and not just the s series with a pen now it is the same im still getting it mainly because of the usb so whatever
Android,not_removed,because it wont be used its a waste of power and money
Android,not_removed,im like sure that if you have a bad experience on a pc with of ram then the bottleneck is elsewhere and most probably on the hdd
Android,not_removed,still multitasks better than android even on and its a real os not a glorified calculator
Android,not_removed,lol no my has only gb of ram and its not too far off from my custom rig with gb and an ssd
Android,not_removed,ive run vista on just ram its nothing to write home about but its also not miserable
Android,not_removed,isnt that difference rather negligable unless its like gigs or more
Android,not_removed,desktop linux uses both disk caching and virtual memory
Android,not_removed,you said but this discussion happened multiple times already just google it so it appears that upheymanss agrees
Android,not_removed,im saying when the bar is only its entirely realistic that they could beat it they were getting with single lane so its possible
Android,not_removed,yes i agree with you in that battery life is the top concern for everyone right now since you can already get a nice experience on any phone besides battery life and it would be great if paying a premium got you better battery instead of marginally better everything else however what i was saying is that the edge trumping the flat version is not a direct proof of that and thats specially true for gaming since the flat version has a smaller screen so sot is fairly similar to the edge people might also like the edge because of the bigger screen or the wow factor and not even samsung knows for certain what was the bigger factor
Android,not_removed,note near identical the cpu on the and note were near identical
Android,not_removed,what better stuff do you want them to add
Android,not_removed,i agree i honestly think they will be merging them with the edge version of the s series in the near future
Android,not_removed,well it could theorethically be used wouldnt it
Android,not_removed,im like sure that if you have a bad experience on a pc with of ram then the bottleneck is elsewhere and most probably on the hdd how can you be that if you dont even know how people use their pc i have a living room pc with i have a few convinience tools always open like taskbar tweaker ahk splashtop streamer etc as well as soundcard and video driver controls and sabnzbd download server using chrome with a few installed extensions on that thing will cause my ram to fill up relatively quickly beginning at plus tabs open which isnt much for me
Android,not_removed,depends on the oem samsung is notorious for terrible ram management other oems easily beat out the iphone
Android,not_removed,bullshit
Android,not_removed,to do what any kind of work with documents and browser will need a lot more ram than that to prevent things grinding to a halt due to constant paging to disk
Android,not_removed,youre losing about percent of the ram
Android,not_removed,only if you set it up on some of my computer i dont
Android,not_removed,it will have less battery life than the edge
Android,not_removed,better specs any specs
Android,not_removed,i can bet that becasue most valuesensitive laptops manufactured skimp on the hard drive and putting an sdd is the go to upgrade for making your experience better on the cheap my last laptop was a satellite i switched the drive to an ssd and it flipped through tabs like it was nothing youtube and social media tabs and no hiccups now i have a inspiron with a slow as molasses hdd and it hangs quite regularly with the exact same use even with its generationsahead processor and extra gigs of ram
Android,not_removed,recommend you try it and while youre calling miserable i wholeheartedly recommend you try out something like the surface and dont get me wrong i love my as much as the next guy it just aint built for it
Android,not_removed,your argument was that windows requires more than of ram for the user to not have a miserable experience which is flat out wrong i had running vista then running i never experienced said misery and both were midrange gaming desktops hell i had two mmo games running simultaneously together taking of physical ram and vista didnt choke whats your excuse
Android,not_removed,right i guess thats not a tragedy but it is far from negligible
Android,not_removed,and you simultaneously run all the same applications and services that you do on windows
Android,not_removed,not necessarily the note had a disproportionately large increase in battery compared to the
Android,not_removed,you dont know that
Android,not_removed,oh you are talking about laptops but of people dont use laptops yet my living room pc doesnt use a laptop disk but a fast full size barracuda hdd while its not a ssd it isnt slow either i get what you are saying with laptops most laptop hdd are slow as fuck of course having a fast ssd also helps in situations in that you are ram limited since windows will cache on the disk when low on ram but that will not keep your system as fast as it would be with enough free ram the same is true on android were opening an app on a samsung device with fast storage is faster than on a device with slow storage like a nexus but still not as instant as when the app is already in ram i dont doubt your experiences but at the same time different people have different usage cases and different amount of background software and not all of that is just bloat for me of ram is usable but not comfortable on android is already great but i would love to have a device with nearly all apps remaining in ram once opened
Android,not_removed,most of the similar ones and without any heavy security suite either way android runs fat and bloated
Android,not_removed,youre defending a phonewhy the hell do you care so much about defending a phone
Android,not_removed,yup i think we can agree on everything said here oh and on desktops i think its dirt cheap to upgrade ram so thats nice but for laptops the best way is to go ssd first and then check for the next bottleneck glad we could have a civil discussion thats increasingly hard to get on tech subs cheers
Android,not_removed,and while youre calling miserable i wholeheartedly recommend you try out something like the surface

Android,not_removed,if theres anyone else that keeps mixing up the names and screen sizes heres a silly way of remembering sailfishsmall marlinmassive
Android,not_removed,what about the screen size that people are getting from the buildprop it seems like most are saying inches while nearly every leak previously said inches for sailfish is there any way to definitively prove screen size from the buildprop
Android,not_removed,man if they arent adding front firing speakers i hope that wont be the norm for the rest of the nexus line i really love my front facing speakers and have no desire going back to the peasant speakers
Android,not_removed,im more annoyed about the rumoured storage options for these phones with the options apparently being limited to and gb with not gb option in between i found that gb is the perfect sweet spot for me especially for the price i got my for
Android,not_removed,screw that battery on the sailfish has the same battery on the and it could be much better
Android,not_removed,any idea of when the release date may be
Android,not_removed,i hope that they will have htcs great digitizers like in the htc
Android,not_removed,im not sure if anyone will read this but i thought i would clear up the format of earlier model numbers of high end quallcomm socs the last years for socs with built in basebands letter code for socs without basebands letter code there may be more combinations but it seems to me the first digit indicates an soc and the second indicates the cellular connectivity built in the last two digits indicate the architecture of the rest of the soc including cpu gpu and isp the last letters indicate revisions of the architecture and are often omitted how big these changes can be i dont know but the number of cores and model of gpu and isp should be the same there have been some changes to the cpu architecture like changing from krait to krait but i think these are rather small differences since for instance the die area has stayed the same when the revision number is omitted from files like buildprop i think that indicates its not necessary to include in the sense that the different revisions use the same drivers and have the same features the snapdragon model numbers seem more arbitrary to me and i think its overall less important than the architecture but i dont think quallcomm are going to keep around old revisions for long since these are probably small changes that are easy to put into production and give significant improvements when the came with a pro after the snapdragon new revision of pro was released what the got was more like an artificially limited snapdragon than the older pro so i guess quallcomm didnt want to keep making the old version this meant it had better power efficiency than for instance the
Android,not_removed,it would be perfect if sailfishos got ported to sailfish as an official release
Android,not_removed,a dedicated dac and amp is all i wish
Android,not_removed,why such a tiny battery on the sailfish way to guarantee the battery life will be mediocre
Android,not_removed,if the sailfish had an sd slot and front firing speakers itd be the best phone for me hands down i like the axon a lot but i really dont want such a massive screen i feel like in a few years phablets will be inch screens lol
Android,not_removed,is it too much to ask for a nexus phone with a replaceable battery and an sd card slot
Android,not_removed,id say its possible the new nexus might have the but examining the past the phones used processors that had been in the wild in phones for a decent amount of time already there arent any phones yet and its only about a month prior to when google usually officially announces new devices i think there is a strong likelihood that these will be but even so im encouraged to see the same soc is likely being used in both sizes im tired of this artificiallyperpetuated bigger phone gets the better soc that weve seen with the and but then again perhaps that was more to do with the ability to dump heat from the so the was a better option for the at the time
Android,not_removed,inches is just too small for me guess i will just stick with my nexus for now when will they realize there actually is a plus market for the nexus
Android,not_removed,amoled ewww expected an ips panel on the small one
Android,not_removed,im afraid that unless they have a sd card slotwhich we all know they wont then im not budging from my i might try to get a or something similar around my birthday
Android,not_removed,sailfish are such a fun fish to catch
Android,not_removed,ugh no more screen
Android,not_removed,put the headphone jack on the bottom or i burn this mother down
Android,not_removed,any predictions as to the price of the new phones on google fi
Android,not_removed,really like to see the tensorflow processors tpus on the phone do we know if this is going to happen this round
Android,not_removed,lets dispel once and for all with this fiction that google doesnt know what theyre doing they know exactly what theyre doing
Android,not_removed,any chance nexus devices get released in carrier stores again anytime soon i use att next and want a stock or close to it android experience would love a nexus or even flagship motorola instead of having to continue to deal with touchwiz
Android,not_removed,i would be cool with an in a nexus small screen cpu kind to a battery fits in a pocket
Android,not_removed,or just brush up on your marine biology a sailfish is about long a marlin is about long therefore the marlin is the bigger one
Android,not_removed,well i wouldnt call massive really more of a disappointment
Android,not_removed,hows that toaster so far
Android,not_removed,if marlin or sailfish have same specification only screen size or battery bigger in marlin so what do prefer
Android,not_removed,are they really going to name it sailfish is this google showing its middle finger at the sailfish os
Android,not_removed,so people are seeing and figuring a display with a dpi of is about inches so this means sailfish has a screen close but no there is no way to tell screen size from the buildprop rosflcddensity doesnt have anything to do with the hardware lcd density is a software setting that tells android what scale to draw the ui in a lower number will zoom out and youll be able to see more on the screen at once a higher number will make everything bigger for older versions of android you will find on how to change rosflcddensity its such a popular hack that in nougat google made it in the display settings it has very little do with the actual display hardware the most spec divination you could do with it is tell the difference between a tablet and a phone by ballparking the number into a certain range rosflcddensity and the dpi of the display are two totally different things and if they ever exactly match it is purely coincidence
Android,not_removed,nah you cant really prove screen size from the buildprop the dpi can help you guess but a dpi doesnt necessarily discount leaks of a screen
Android,not_removed,vs isnt really contradictory is commonly called a screen in marketing speak
Android,not_removed,i have absolutely no idea why it isnt the industry standard it makes such a huge difference
Android,not_removed,seriously i have a nexus and im about to buy a note my biggest reservation is that the speaker will be so bad on the note ill hate it ive never had a phone with dual front facing speaker before my nexus but the thought of going back to a tinny quiet bottom speaker that gets blocked every time you hold the phone wrong is the only thing making me question buying the new note
Android,not_removed,i didnt even notice that damn that would suck my galaxy had a single tiny speaker in the back of the phone which meant every time you used it you had to cup your hand around the back so pointless ive gotten spoiled with my and
Android,not_removed,everyone seems pro front facing i wonder why manufacturers dont just do it seems like easy way to make people happy
Android,not_removed,im looking into a phone with those and the most recent two with good rootrom support are the and the moto x
Android,not_removed,i know dual speakers was so amazing even youtube having left and right channels was something i really enjoyed its the only thing holding me back from wanting the marlin i guess you could say that marlin will have better battery due to more efficient cpu faster phone that doesnt overheat hopefully newer gen amoled and stronger aluminum these make up for the single speaker that your hand covers of the time
Android,not_removed,htc doesnt make front firing speakers anymore
Android,not_removed,if they are doing the typical upgrade for storages then more for the is better and i wont complain
Android,not_removed,yeah its a little bit of an odd setup
Android,not_removed,i just wish they would include an sd slot im using gb of a gig sd card plus gb internal combined
Android,not_removed,well its not too far off from honestly lets just hope that the final build of android n truly does significantly improve battery life to the point where that milliamp battery is actually pretty good id be super excited if they really improve battery life because then my htc would be a beast and people could use phones with smaller batteries without issue
Android,not_removed,im more concerned about those probably single downfiring speakers
Android,not_removed,well it would have a much more efficient cpu in turn bringing better battery edit the was very inefficient so anytjing would be better the wasnt great either
Android,not_removed,at least this year itll be with an amoled display and a much more powerefficient soc
Android,not_removed,no clue last nexus event was in late september
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,what about the htcs digitiser makes it great curious as i have no idea about them
Android,not_removed,well thats why i specified the most popular models of both the sd and the most manufacturers wanted lte i really dont see meaning anything other than an or an maybe an but we dont even know if thats a real thing or not whatever it is it would have to be similar enough to the to share its model number
Android,not_removed,that right but the letters arent in the buildprop just look up buildprop of phones with the and eg galaxy is httppastebincomcmfvjhcd lg is as is my nexus
Android,not_removed,so your argument is that because two internal model numbers can correspond to two marketing model numbers the opposite can be the case here i think ops example of and is much more applicable
Android,not_removed,nexus has the same size screen screen and had so sailfish is actually bigger than that also should be a more efficient chip then the in old nexus plus sailfish will have a screen as well so it isnt the biggest but certainly not bad if you compare to the old nexus
Android,not_removed,no modern nexus has had a micro sd slot i dont think theyll be starting any time soon
Android,not_removed,theres almost certainly going to be a option and you can always use a usb typec flash drive
Android,not_removed,i want the sailfish to be a nexus with ram and good front firing speakers that would make me very happy
Android,not_removed,while were still wasting our time hoping for sd slot on nexus lines how about batteries waterproofing front and back facing speakers front and back finger print sensors no bezels anything else
Android,not_removed,yeah
Android,not_removed,is just a higherbinned ill be fine with it heck ill probably even underclock it to improve battery life
Android,not_removed,you are definitely in the minority
Android,not_removed,im wondering the same thing i was considering getting a new phone this year but when the nexus leaks started saying it would only be i decided im not i cant stand a smaller phone now everything smaller just feels like a toy
Android,not_removed,they should have made it a or they could easily made it smaller than the nexus with a screen due to the massive bezels on the
Android,not_removed,im with you might have to survive another year
Android,not_removed,when will they realize there actually is a plus market for the nexus never because it doesnt exist more people want smaller phones rather than bigger ones just explore around the internet yourself and see
Android,not_removed,for me id love to go down a small bump from the massive the new nexus looks great probably not switching myself though
Android,not_removed,why
Android,not_removed,yeah i wanted an updated panel used in the but no way thats happening with daydream maybe itll be rgb rather than pentile at least
Android,not_removed,unless sd cards are particularly crucial in the daily use of your phone i wouldnt go for the at the end of the day youre still going to have a much laggier experience thanks to touchwiz and youre gonna be slow to get updates the nexuss will also be faster than the even ignoring the speed improvement inherent in using stock android there are workarounds for storage usbc flash drives buying a model there arent workarounds for laggy bloated skins and slow updates
Android,not_removed,its on the top
Android,not_removed,it being on the bottom of my always annoys me i have to put it upside down in my pocket what do you not like about it being on the top
Android,not_removed,not really were not even sure what theyll cost outright yet its anyones guess as to what deals theyll provide with fi activation outright though i think they might be on the more expensive end my guess complete speculation is for marlin and for sailfish
Android,not_removed,you almost certainly wont be able to buy one in a carrier store on contract but you can always just buy one outright from the play store and stick an att sim in it
Android,not_removed,i heard that sprint will be the first carrier to release the htc marlin that makes a little sense because in the past they carried the nexus idk about att or other carriers
Android,not_removed,the real image of nexus marlin from techdroider is literally just a picture of a screen you cannot see anything about the phone except the screen only god knows what phone is actually under that monstrous contraption of a case maybe its marlin but it doesnt matter because its literally just a screen its useless information so i didnt post it and yeah the techdroider render was actually specifically what i was referring to when i said that the rest are probably just photoshopped htc thats a photoshopped htc there are signs of photoshop all over it theyre saying its accurate but then admitting they dont even have the devices dimensions no indication is given of the leaks provenance and its rather hard to blindly trust a site as entirely unknown as techdroider david ruddock ap i do not blindly trust ap i trust them because they have a very good track record and are a wellestablished android news site techdroider is not leaks are leaks and rumors are rumors but i have been given no reason to believe that techdroiders leaks are anywhere near as trustworthy as aps until i have some such reason i wont give much credence to a photoshopped htc
Android,not_removed,but they can be wrong too like they did with naming of kitkat they werent wrong about that key lime pie was the name until last minute that google made the deal with nestle only a handful of googlers knew about it
Android,not_removed,your not serious you really believe that render just wow
Android,not_removed,a would be kind of pushing it if they were going for a cheap efficient roadwarrior kind of thing i could maybe see them using a i wouldnt buy it but there would be a market the on the other hand is pretty stinkin lowend
Android,not_removed,us users end up with a equivalent every time you sneeze and the cpu throttles trust me you do not want a
Android,not_removed,meh i thought id be cool with a weaker processor too but the in the is pretty annoying sometimes
Android,not_removed,huh htc has been doing pretty well recently they pretty much killed it with the htc especially hardwarewise which is what matters to us here theyve even gotten alright about bezels
Android,not_removed,why or these htc nexus ordered a but will sell if these are good want daydream
Android,not_removed,nexuses dont have sd cards its been like this for years keep up
Android,not_removed,thats about and respectively
Android,not_removed,yeah ssmall is a bit easier than learning the sizes of fish i think but thanks anyways
Android,not_removed,i love that they codenamed the shamu because its a fucking whale
Android,not_removed,so thats why the nexus is called shamu
Android,not_removed,sailfish is a real fish they got real creative with that name what is that bird oh its the flyingbird no whats the actual name like that species yeah flyingbird dude marine biologists smh
Android,not_removed,inches is average though 😥
Android,not_removed,sailfish is the codename for the phone
Android,not_removed,sailfish is just the codename all nexuses have fish codenames
Android,not_removed,heheheheheh
Android,not_removed,otoh the nexus has a dpi very close to its ppi
Android,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but doesnt a bigger dpi make the screen zoom out and let you fit more onto the screen rather than a smaller dpi i thought it was similar to the effect of higher resolutions vs low resolution minus the actual definition where higher resolution seemingly shrinks icons and asked allows extra room to fit more things
Android,not_removed,can you give an example of a phone with a inch screen marketed as
Android,not_removed,my guess is a aesthetics the front grills are admittedly ugly and prone to getting dirty but i cant imagine going back to anything else after the
Android,not_removed,speaking for myself i probably use my phones speakers no more than once or twice a year i always prefer bottom firing speakers for the improved aesthetics since i care literally about my phones speakers in fact i wouldnt honestly mind if it had no speakers different people have different priorities
Android,not_removed,because most people dont give a fuck
Android,not_removed,another issue is that if the note is waterproof the speakers will sound crap
Android,not_removed,ive played with the and can confirm the speaker sucks its clear and rich but very quiet
Android,not_removed,why are you buying a note if you already have a
Android,not_removed,looks plain and simple we love it but the general public dont
Android,not_removed,if the gets its bootloader unlocked we have a winner
Android,not_removed,nexus usually dont do dollars difference i think already in india difference in tiers is much less than difference in tiers of iphone or samsung devices still if this means replaces version who can complain
Android,not_removed,maybe there is an upgrade to storage type as well when you move up emmc for the and samsungs new dual lane ufs for the model if youre getting gouged for storage might as well get a performance bump too
Android,not_removed,ive been curious as to why those are disappearing did it have to be sacrificed for the space for a slimmer design or other hardware
Android,not_removed,and the amoled screen could be pretty efficient too and android n with immediate doze not as great as having a battery but i think it should be quite serviceable
Android,not_removed,thats what i had hoped for my nexus and turns out it only gives it an okay battery at the very very best
Android,not_removed,they say the same thing every year about efficient and then you end up getting the same mediocre hours of sot and theyll tell you its not that bad because off quick charging
Android,not_removed,that is true actually with amoled
Android,not_removed,announcement was late sept when was ship date
Android,not_removed,i heard that the touch response is really amazing on the htc which might be why its so great
Android,not_removed,i have the htc coming from an lg on the if i was on a webpage and touch the screen and move up and down the screen movement was about half a second or so behind my finger movement on the htc that delay isnt really there its actually pretty noticeable and very nice
Android,not_removed,yeah but nexus battery is absolute dogshit sigh where are the flagships with mah batteries
Android,not_removed,certainly not bad if you compare to a phone
Android,not_removed,and dont forget doze improvements
Android,not_removed,i was surprised the and didnt somewhat since they were adding the whole adoptable storage thing and the nexus phones usually highlight mostall of the new android features of course they really want you using all the googley cloud features more
Android,not_removed,yup i know i man can dream though lol
Android,not_removed,you think sailfish will have a option the only has options if i remember correctly
Android,not_removed,really
Android,not_removed,add sd card and back finger print sensor and im sold hell ill prob cave and buy it anyways its between the htc and sailfish at this point just hoping we see it soon
Android,not_removed,well i cant help you with of those but the new nexus phones are rumored to have back finger print sensors i too would like larger batteries and ffs waterproofing is nice and all but it would ruin the speakers and ive never dropped my phone in water my whole life so id rather have the better speakers but thats just me
Android,not_removed,why
Android,not_removed,we are dozens
Android,not_removed,bigger screen smaller bezel that is how you make it
Android,not_removed,there is one i came from the xperia z ultra community plus i look at all the articles for the up coming mi max zenfone ultra and lenovo phab pro and i see lots of people excited for those phones just because you have small hands doesnt mean that there arent people out there with bigger hands who want bigger phones for me and many others inches is the sweet spot but the zenfone ultra looks promising
Android,not_removed,funny a year or two ago it was the opposite
Android,not_removed,people did mock the original galaxy note for being a laughably enormous inches and being too large to actually use that size is average now i think people to a large degree dont know what they want
Android,not_removed,just drop the ridiculously huge bezels of the and it would be the same size as the
Android,not_removed,burn in ive had to rma too many amoled phones id pay a premium for lcd i lovethe way amoled looks but i apparently kill it in less than a year every time
Android,not_removed,pentile gross and motorolas ips panels are still better than samsungs amoleds in most metrics they just look better to me i can still see the large spaces between subpixels on amoleds at that resolution
Android,not_removed,i think people are clinging onto old conceptions of samsung and lag touchwiz definitely used to be laggy nowadays though our phones are faster than some computers and samsung has really cleaned up their act if your phone is still laggy on your home screen youre doing something wrong
Android,not_removed,touchwiz doesnt lag anymore at least not on my phone you cant judge a phone completely by negative experiences of other users i can find negative experiences of the too but it doesnt mean the is a bad phone so please dont judge the that way either it is a very fast device in my experience
Android,not_removed,i get a laggy experience as it is on my how bad is the
Android,not_removed,i just went from a to a edge exynos model not true i jumped to the from a note because i couldnt take samsungs lag and lack of software updates anymore but honestly as much as i love love love my it has its own issues build quality bending it happened to me twice even though i babied it bluetooth stuttering thermal throttling etc i will say that the camera is better aside from speed than the oversharpens and doesnt have hdr for amazing night shots on the same for speakers but aside from that the edge again exynos feels like a nocompromise device it doesnt lag it doesnt stutter it gets a little warm when gaming not boiling hot like the in the headphone audio is also way better thanks to the wolfson dac again exynos its more pocketable despite having the same usable screen size nav bar on the brings screen size down to usbcmicrousb is a nonstarter for me i know usbc is the future but everyone in the real world is still using micro right now oh and the biggest thing for me is battery life i got hours sot yesterday with my with battery left i had battery anxiety with my but now i dont and it feels liberating i can use my phone without worrying about it not being able to survive the day
Android,not_removed,a man can pray for a last minute design switch for real though who the fuck wants the jack on the top its inferior in every sense
Android,not_removed,well i put my phone in my pocket upside down so when you reach in and grab it you can unlock it and have it right side up when you pull it out also when youre holding it the cord just drapes down and you dont have to get it out of the way to read the screen or have it in the way in the back i see absolutely no advantage to port on the top
Android,not_removed,people put their phones in their pockets upside down its just the more natural movement
Android,not_removed,ok thanks
Android,not_removed,i know theyre usually purchased unlocked but i know they have sold them in carrier stores in the past what made them decide to sell the nexus on contract and why wouldnt they do it again im just oblivious to this stuff never owned a nexus but tired of samsung after my last phones
Android,not_removed,why would you pay more to get a phone on contract just buy it seperately
Android,not_removed,where did you hear that
Android,not_removed,plus it says android version n and have july security update date but on my with the same security update is says android a bit weird that their july version dont have the same info as the other dps
Android,not_removed,the phone in the real picture looks like its in a case you can see it easiest on the right edge close to the top where light is reflecting off it and at the bottom right where theres a void sticker those stickers are also on the left
Android,not_removed,the real picture has a phone in a case that doesnt even show a front facing camera surely you think itll have a camera on the front
Android,not_removed,its also disingenuous to refer to a photoshop mash up as a render
Android,not_removed,or a
Android,not_removed,the was a poor attempt at high end at the time i dont want high end i want an ultra efficient lower end specd phone that has clean androis
Android,not_removed,god dammit google these phones are just getting ridiculously big now
Android,not_removed,thank you the imperial system makes everything seems huge because bigger numbers
Android,not_removed,so if marlin is inches that makes the sailfish inches thats going to be a damn small phone
Android,not_removed,ssmall but mlarge mmedium llarge nexus leviathan confirmed
Android,not_removed,a name given to a member of the largest dolphin
Android,not_removed,i think they named it as such because its dorsal fin kinda looks like a boat sail
Android,not_removed,no such thing as a seagull i found just a gull that lives by the sea
Android,not_removed,maybe
Android,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but doesnt a bigger dpi make the screen zoom out and let you fit more onto the screen rather than a smaller dpi a smaller number in rosflcddensity makes the display zoom out and show more it sounds like youre equating rosflcddensity with hardware display dpi again theyre completely unrelated things your comment is actually a great example of how theyre completely unrelated things a nexus has a display a nexus has a display the thing that makes the nexus ui a tablet and the nexus ui a phone isnt the hardware display size or hardware dpi but the rosflcddensity settings the nexus uses the nexus uses nearly the same resolution but you get more stuff on the nexus because of the lower rosflcddensity number android doesnt know anything about the physical display size
Android,not_removed,nexus or so inch screen commonly referred to as inch nexus inch screen commonly referred to as inch that being said i think the nexus was marketed as inch while the i think was not cmiiw
Android,not_removed,nexus as in screen actual screen size is
Android,not_removed,you just have to turn the volume up to blow away the dust s
Android,not_removed,exactly the note is waterproof this time the note speaker sucked and this will probably be worse
Android,not_removed,where did you get to do that
Android,not_removed,i figured i work in a phone carrier store but our samsung rep came by and showed it off on my off day so i heard all the info from my coworkers but havent actually gotten hands on time yet myself i assume thats how you got to play with it too
Android,not_removed,pen and battery 🔋
Android,not_removed,first of all im keeping my its not going anywhere and second of all i miss all the great samsung features that my nexus doesnt do expandable storage water resistance wireless charging samsung pay a whole plethora of customization options always on screen the best display on any phone ois having a camera that actually takes decent video theme support the s pen and all of its features etc what kind of question is that
Android,not_removed,they did increments in the states
Android,not_removed,one can dream
Android,not_removed,because everyone is pushing the cloud specifically their own cloud services as an alternate solution they ignore the reality that many people dont have reliable high speed internet everywhere they go
Android,not_removed,googles wet dream would be to finally be able to remove and support from android completly they pay a shitload in royalties to ms over it
Android,not_removed,early november
Android,not_removed,expect to have it between thanksgiving and christmas
Android,not_removed,google has always used good digitizers i upgraded from the galaxy to the nexus back in and was blown away by the touchscreen dont get me wrong the reacted just fine but the nexus is so much better
Android,not_removed,galaxy
Android,not_removed,it was awesome on kitkat though on lollipop paranoid android its alright sot but opening pokemon go makes my battery stats look depressing p
Android,not_removed,they were also adding native support for dualsim and neither of them has sims i think some new additions to android arent meant for nexus devices but for android one devices
Android,not_removed,mate
Android,not_removed,what weve been hearing about the nexuses indicates that theyre going to be equal in everything but size kind of like the iphone and we know marlin will have options so we can relatively safely assume that sailfish will too nothings set in stone but its a safe bet
Android,not_removed,yeah
Android,not_removed,yes yes
Android,not_removed,replaceable battery is an overrated feature they can make substantially bigger batteries by not using up the space to allow the mechanism to have it removed and if youre carrying around a thing to get more battery an external charger is even better than a second battery since it a doesnt require you to restart your phone and b will usually have way more capacity than a second battery it also limits the ability to make cosmetically pleasing designed phones the sd slot thing is unfortunate probably just google being google and trying to encourage more use of cloud services for some of us the data required to do that is too much so more permanent storage that doesnt cost an arm and a leg like upgrading the internal storage always does would be really nice to have
Android,not_removed,i have large hands and dont wear skinny jeans give me a inch nexus please
Android,not_removed,half dozens surely
Android,not_removed,i dont have small hands theyre around average size its not really because its hard to hold but the fact that its more difficult to put in a pocket
Android,not_removed,yeah because people find inch phones difficult to put in pockets
Android,not_removed,i remember coworkers laughing at my enormous evo when it came out at the time everything was that was a few short years ago and look where we are now
Android,not_removed,something something faster horses
Android,not_removed,id still like a smaller screen for reachability
Android,not_removed,ive been under the impression that the burnin problem has become much less pervasive with modern amoled panels most people with seem to be saying that they have no noticeable burnin but both of them are going to have amoled thats a necessity for them to be daydream ready
Android,not_removed,i was looking at the htc in store for the first time yesterday and was genuinely shocked at how blazing fast it was truly phenomenal speed youtube videos reviewing it must be using older software or something because things happened instantly when you tapped icons loved it made me wanna buy one but waiting to see what the new nexus phones are like although the thought of getting a phone with an amoled screen upsets me so comparing the raw speed of the htc in store to the edge that was on display there too i was equally surprised at how sluggish the ui was on the samsung id heard it was fast and like you said touchwiz had gotten much better but when i was trying out the phone i found animations slow responsiveness slow and there was a noticeable delay loading apps from cold unlike the htc the isnt slow at all but lets just say it takes its sweet time doing its thing compared to the htc i saw or even the i played with
Android,not_removed,the fact remains that touchwiz still does not maintain in its ui performance has improved but it is still significantly less snappy and fluid than stock i saw a guy on rnexus today who switched from a goddamn edge to a relatively cheap and old nexus and was legitimately in awe of how much faster it was
Android,not_removed,in what way is the laggy either way switched from an edge to the nexus even slower than your and was amazed at how much less laggy the nexus was ask him
Android,not_removed,those issues are hardware issues ie shoddy build quality and the snapoven if one were to put touchwiz on an device youd have an absolutely unholy abomination of fiery lag on your hands
Android,not_removed,my guess is that its just easier to put it on the top
Android,not_removed,its a deep port so internals are a part of it plus it actually looks very nice as a design flare on motorola phones
Android,not_removed,dunno the nexus was kind of an outlier
Android,not_removed,they tried it and it wasnt successful si they referred to the play store
Android,not_removed,thats what im suggesting
Android,not_removed,idk if this site is credible enough to be taken seriously but it might be true again considering that sprint once had the nexus in their stores
Android,not_removed,good point
Android,not_removed,so you think android police render is not photoshopped ap them self admitted that their render is their recreation from the leaks they got yes i believe it was modelled not photoshopped the significant difference i note between aps render and tds render is that aps render does not look like it was photoshopped from another phone my qualm is not with whether or not they edited the picture with photoshop my qualm is with whether or not they created the image by editing an image of another phone it makes me much more apt to consider that the renders are legit when i have no plausible basis upon which to conclude that its actually a picture of a completely different phone also you and david ruddock cannot decide whos render is right or fake i respect ap and td both for their leaks and renders but you cannot say that this render is right or this is fake until you have seen it no i cant say definitively which ones fake and which ones real but i can say without a shadow of a doubt which one is way more likely to be real and which ones almost certainly fake by far the largest factor to consider is the credibility of the news sites themselves androidpolice has a very good track record of releasing accurate original leaks their leaks are almost always accurate so i can extrapolate that its almost certainly an accurate render by the same logic techdroider has no track record that i know of about releasing accurate original leaks so i have no basis upon which to conclude that their leak is likely accurate since their leak conflicts with aps leak that i know to be almost certainly accurate ie both leaks cannot be true i can conclude that tds leak is almost certainly false ap said their render is and then they said they dont know google will include htc or nexus or google logo on it yeah because thats a really tiny detail the phones dimensions however are not a tiny detail
Android,not_removed,android one then
Android,not_removed,phones are moving away from microsd its not some kind of revolutionary new feature that manufacturers are failing to yet adopt we have phones with of storage we have the cloud we have usbc flash drives hardly anyone needs microsd anymore so phones arent packing it
Android,not_removed,those are still pretty big fish
Android,not_removed,not anymore sailfish miles marlin miles
Android,not_removed,inch penis or
Android,not_removed,well thats feet vs meter centimeter is smaller than an inch and the comparable scale would be yard vs meter which are almost the same it would be like you giving me a figure in cubic centimetres vs gallons
Android,not_removed,probably a tablet then
Android,not_removed,mmedium mediumgrande grandelarge it just makes sense
Android,not_removed,ohhhhh yeahhh i kind of see that
Android,not_removed,i dont know
Android,not_removed,but the nexus is called that because its the nexus
Android,not_removed,the in doesnt necessarily mean a inch screen the nexus had a inch screen
Android,not_removed,that makes no sense does that mean that is marketing speak for too since its the nexus
Android,not_removed,met a samsung rep in a store who had it as their personal device they let me check it out since announcement is so soon all the leaks are accurate for the most part curved screen ram base storage iris scanner all true
Android,not_removed,yeahhhhhh
Android,not_removed,yes makes sense as difference is around half here too although over priced
Android,not_removed,that was my third guess
Android,not_removed,i guess that makes sense i think im alright with it as long as there is a option ill never fill on a phone but i dont want to have to think about saving space
Android,not_removed,its between this the note the edge and axon any idea how long previous samsung devices were supported for itll probably just come down to that
Android,not_removed,posts yesterday actually were logically explaining how could be a month ahead based on past schedules and timings basically august release so august sometime announce
Android,not_removed,okay fair enough its like the only one tho and it costs like cad
Android,not_removed,too i think
Android,not_removed,the nexus battery life was never awesome compare with the lg of the same era for example
Android,not_removed,oh god no thats even worse than i thought it was rip storage
Android,not_removed,wont marlin have a qhd display instead of sailfishs fhd thats what most sites are saying i think
Android,not_removed,this flash drive for the phone or a laptop
Android,not_removed,i have yet to see a waterproof phone with sound as good as the axon or htc the problem isnt the volume since you are right in that you could just put more powerful speakers in the fundamental problem is the seal in that it changes the sound itself muffles is probably a good word for it basically while volume isnt an issue the quality of the sound is i dont know enough about phone hardware to theorize a solution but i imagine it would be expensive and just not worth the few extra phones you would sell because of it
Android,not_removed,for me its not about swapping on the go im fine with an external charger for that its that in the past ive had batteries wear out after a year or its been really easy just to replace that when necessary
Android,not_removed,no external batteries are far inferior there is loss so if it says youll lose about of that when charging youre then also tethered to a stupid cord swappable battery means you go from in under seconds
Android,not_removed,as long as the battery can be easily servicesim happywith the internal battery hoping googlesinfluence changes this as htcs havent been the easiest recently
Android,not_removed,i have no issues putting my xperia z ultra in pocket
Android,not_removed,my is actually smaller than my brothers and it has a bigger screen but yeah i get your point ive always wanted the biggest screen with the smallest bezels and frontfiring speakers
Android,not_removed,self fulfilling prophecy placebo effect
Android,not_removed,i get typing lag pretty often seemingly for no reason others in the subreddit have complained about the same thing
Android,not_removed,i know im judging the phone as an entire package i think its a great phone that isnt without its flaws i also dont think touchwiz is great especially aesthetically even with themes but it provides a lot of functionality that google doesnt out of the box or doesnt allow such as ad blocking
Android,not_removed,for you
Android,not_removed,wait shit
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,or millilitres to gallons but thats not the point anyways in the english use of the metric system you use cm if an object is usually below and metres if it is above
Android,not_removed,httpsmimgurcomqsoodsqr
Android,not_removed,also fish dont sail around the oceans now if it were called swimfish
Android,not_removed,kind of are you for real the thing has a
Android,not_removed,can you repeat the question
Android,not_removed,stop being sailfish
Android,not_removed,yes it does nexus was because i t was the fourth nexus nexus could be the nexus or refer to the screen the nexus could be the screen or refer to it being the nexus then we come to the and the a logical explanation would be referring to their sizes because what else could it be it doesnt make it right but it certainly makes sense
Android,not_removed,how was the new touchwiz like
Android,not_removed,the note released in sep did not get the marshmallow update the nexus released in oct did receive the marshmallow update what im seeing is that samsungs usually get years of updates and nexuses usually get
Android,not_removed,so i think google will release and ship them before new iphones come out so maybe announced in august shipped early september
Android,not_removed,xiaomi although probably wont have the right band support
Android,not_removed,compared to my sii it was p
Android,not_removed,what do you keep on your phone everything is streamed now i cant even figure out how to fill a phone
Android,not_removed,yeah marlin will be sailfish will be the difference in screen size balances it out a bit and its really not that big of a difference
Android,not_removed,whatever you want
Android,not_removed,his points about optimizing the design and allowing for a larger battery is true though
Android,not_removed,the isnt smaller than the theyre roughly the same height but is narrower than the
Android,not_removed,okay hardly anyone that doesnt browse randroid
Android,not_removed,pretty sure if you pull them out of the water theyll die
Android,not_removed,i really dont know whats hard about it if you gave me your height in cm itd seem bigger than my height in feet its not the imperial system that is to blame for making it seem bigger it is the units
Android,not_removed,sail swim meh close enough haha
Android,not_removed,lol the overnight downvotes mate to me that does not look like a sail maybe you have a different kind of sail in your mind
Android,not_removed,youre not the boss of me now
Android,not_removed,nexus tablets also have numbers that correspond to screen size
Android,not_removed,pretty much the same its always been a little bit more animated very similar to the a bit toned down but still very there edge panels are the same too still no preinstalled good lock so it has the normal touchwiz notifications and quick settings still also the unit i used was on not so that could change very impressive display though and its a lot more rounded no sharp feeling edges like the i think the coolest thing is its even with the pen removed comes in silver black and blue the recent renders are entirely accurate though edit also the edges are not as prominent as in the past they subtly curve down
Android,not_removed,guess ill just wait for marlin then thanks a lot
Android,not_removed,im worried more about lack of support
Android,not_removed,i like to keep a lot of media on my phone to avoid using data as well as not be affected by data cut out when in sparsely populated areas also i keep a lot of audiobooks so i guess that takes up some space but i just think in general its such a easy thing to add it makes no sense not to axons method is great where you can add a sim card or sd card in the same slot pretty ingenious
Android,not_removed,everything is streamed now fwiw just because you stream everything doesnt mean everyone does phones can be very flexible multipurpose devices with many different kinds of users so theres no sense in saying my use case requires very little storage so everyone else should make do with the same
Android,not_removed,music streaming battery drain and inconsistent performance ive had unlimited data and google play music all access since day and i still ended up downloading worth of media to my phone local will always be better than an unlimited cloud
Android,not_removed,and the analogy of vs you made still works as they have different resolutions as well
Android,not_removed,any good suggestions and can you plug it into a and transfer files direct
Android,not_removed,is that why they wear the mask
Android,not_removed,did i say it was hard
Android,not_removed,damn man chill
Android,not_removed,not really
Android,not_removed,i think hes saying that the kind of is lacking as the giant fin really looks like a sail
Android,not_removed,in terms of updates you get weekly ones and very quick security updates in terms of customer support im not sure though
Android,not_removed,on the same vein just because you still store your media it doesnt mean he has to know that and gets to be drowned in downvotes for asking a question geez some days this is worse than xda
Android,not_removed,yep thats what i had in mind except with the vs the its vs ive always found it kinda funny how much they continue to tout their retina displays when theyre now some of the most lowres phones on the market
Android,not_removed,yes it would be extremely painful otherwise
Android,not_removed,i didnt realize i cant be chill while also explaining that the guys issue above had nothing to do with the imperial system in general
Android,not_removed,i had no idea people were so concerned with wording on a joke lol im unsure why that post even attracted so much attention
Android,not_removed,right i think thats the disagreement i understand d the only sail i can think of is these now those look pretty similar
Android,not_removed,the latter is what im worried about to be honest
Android,not_removed,oh i wasnt among the downvoters i realize that im part of the who highly value local storage the post wasnt quite dickish enough to warrant a downvote thats why i started with fwiw instead of hey fuck you heh
Android,not_removed,aaand im lost
Android,not_removed,those are still pretty big fish
Android,not_removed,well now you know downvotes hurt man
Android,not_removed,well to be honest a lot of it has to do with your responses saying ohhhhh yeahhh i kind of see that and sail swim meh close enough haha kind of implies you missed the point especially after you were critical of marine biologists for their naming i mean to get down to the point if you spent seconds by putting in sailfish into wikipedia youd see in the first two sentences why they are named that to which if your response was oye im not sure how i missed that it seems blatantly obvious now sail fish sail on the back of a fish then you probably wouldnt have received so much backlash instead we got a bunch of lol haha which seems on the whole immature and like you are pushing aside your previous comments you see the point i am making
Android,not_removed,yeah english has its quirks like you singular you plural i wasnt personally accusing you it was the hive that went down on umyfistinyourass for asking a goddamn question
Android,not_removed,hardly the vast majority of people dont have data plans where they can afford to just stream everything
Android,not_removed,dark knight rises reference
Android,not_removed,me too anyone have a compass
Android,not_removed,me too anyone have a compass

Android,not_removed,ive tried on separate occasions to put cm on this phone but the bootloader and flash process is so damn complex and annoying compared to most other phones that i had to give up luckily ive grown to like miui
Android,not_removed,lol samsung
Android,not_removed,its not that bad only took me a couple of hours i recommend you try again
Android,not_removed,put phone into edl adb reboot edl flash latest global developer rom targz with mi tools boot it and log into the mi account that has the bl unlock token enable everything it asks for boot into fastboot and run unlock tool fastboot flash recovery twrpimg fastboot boot twrpimg dont let it boot miui not even once wipe and install lineage
Android,not_removed,i just went through this would you like help
Android,not_removed,aye it has the same bugs as namely that the camera and flashlight do work but theyre buggy everything else is pretty stable the cameralight issues should be fixed with nougat drivers which are supposedly coming soon the only visible differencea are in the boot animation and the device settings this is normal as at this point lineageos is a very much unchanged fork of
Android,not_removed,its automated system and it assigned samsung flair because of note in the title
Android,not_removed,the xiaomi unlock tool has never worked for me tried factory resets making new mi accounts everything that leaves the option to flash a modified miui rom which has the bootloader unlocked and that process soft bricked my device a few times but ill bite which guide did you use
Android,not_removed,unlock tool gets stuck at cannot verify
Android,not_removed,i tried this but flashing cm through twrp caused it to get stuck in a boot loop
Android,not_removed,i understand but why dont they fix it
Android,not_removed,have you tried unlocking it unofficially thats what i had to do in the end ill link you a guide if you want
Android,not_removed,enable find my device on miui
Android,not_removed,i think ive tried that if that entails flashing a custom miui rom but link me anyway
Android,not_removed,i managed to unlock it officially just yesterday apparently there was this button on the developer rom which managed to fully and not partially associate the bootloader with a particular xiaomi account somehow
Android,not_removed,i think this was the guide that worked for me
Android,not_removed,tldr it is not easily accessible in the play store and in newupdated app section no longer need a direct link

Android,not_removed,honestly the one looks alright but i wouldnt say any of them looks good the first one looks especially bad
Android,not_removed,snapped that hey the window of my car like super quick auto hdr i always leave it on
Android,not_removed,hahahaha nice try mate i thought you were being sarcastic until i saw your username httpiimgurcomjgisfonjpg these were the only i took without purposely trying to select a good one
Android,not_removed,these rnt good though
Android,not_removed,none of those are good
Android,not_removed,ones alright but the others are pretty shite
Android,not_removed,looks like ass
Android,not_removed,what miui version you are on
Android,not_removed,can the snapdragon version be found in the uk im struggling to find it keep finding the helio one
Android,not_removed,uninstall reddit please
Android,not_removed,the first one didnt have anything specific to capture it was just a blank shot
Android,not_removed,lol but yeah demolishes that phone
Android,not_removed,do you really think im trying to compete with flagship phones that showoff behaviour is childish mate
Android,not_removed,theyre acceptable first one didnt have anything to capture plus i was trying to push the limits of this phone
Android,not_removed,im not trying to compete with any phone here i just said that i managed to snap some good pics with this phone plus it was the best of for each pic
Android,not_removed,they are decent i believe acceptable by all means camera hwsw is shit to begin with no ois or large pixels or large aperture or hdr
Android,not_removed,im not saying anything but our countrys best tech mag digit did a camera comparison
Android,not_removed,i was trying to push my phones capabilities to the limits edit why am i being downvoted if i would be trying to compare it with or pixel that would be silly this isnt silly
Android,not_removed,shills plz go removed please take the time to make contributory comments instead of calling others names and read our rules linked in the sidebar
Android,not_removed,why i believe they are decent
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,get one from aliexpress
Android,not_removed,please remove all your accounts from the internet and wipe out your digital existence order issued by
Android,not_removed,everytime i take a picture with my usd i marvel how fucking good the camera is for the amount i paid for it
Android,not_removed,the price and zero throttle crazy performance and god tier battery demolishes the
Android,not_removed,cheapo will rek this
Android,not_removed,lol thats the only thing youre doing here trying to compare your phones lowlight performance with all the pixel posts considering you actually thought these photos were surprisingly great i dont think your opinion on cameras is worth very much youve denied being a xiaomi fanboy but youre constantly trying to compare your phone to everyone elses and youre always trying to shit on samsung your motives are extremely transparent
Android,not_removed,exactly you said they were good theyre bad
Android,not_removed,this basically confirms it as crap
Android,not_removed,because there wasnt much to begin with hht mode doesnt work well hdr mode is my best shot no matter what
Android,not_removed,lower ram no expandable storage smaller battery ensured that i wouldnt buy the those are more important to me than having bit better pics my phones camera performs well in daylight
Android,not_removed,lower ram no expandable storage waaaay smaller battery didnt let me choose the over this that phone was my choice after zenfone
Android,not_removed,please dont troll me your comments seem to be helpful at one point until you start acting pissed off for no reason and no im not trying to compete with anything this phones weakest point is low light camera performance and so i thought it would be great to try and push it to the limits no ois or no hdr or large pixels or large aperture mate
Android,not_removed,with all the flagships ive tested i can say that if this phone can come absolutely anywhere close to them without any of the hardware or software enhancements the camera here is acceptable i bet nobody can snap better pics out of this phone or a phone with similar hardware
Android,not_removed,fastest focusing out there plus out of all teh inr phones except moto x play it is the best you could say the oneeyed man amongst the blind lol
Android,not_removed,and ones are acceptable by all means
Android,not_removed,i never said the phone itself was good i just said the camera was downright amazing for the price it has the same sensor as the and essentially the same sensor as the pixel
Android,not_removed,whats your point you said good pictures theyre not got nothing to do with the other specs
Android,not_removed,im not trying to troll you at all you just happen to rub me and a lot of others too the wrong way as youre constantly fanboying over your phone and then shitting on everyone else youre always taking immature jabs at touchwiz calling it laggy cartoonish shit you always arguing that lcd is superior to amoled even though many people have proven to you that theyre not and you just wont shut up about how your phone is the perfect phone but apparently the is a fragile piece of shit then you post delusional threads like this that claim your camera is surprisingly good in low light when its pretty much the exact opposite im just giving you a little bit of your own medicine after all the rubbish you post to everyone else you are literally the biggest fanboy that ive ever met in my life and ive been on reddit for over years and accounts almost every one of your comments is either shitting on another phone or comparing yours to another like it somehow makes you superior go through your own comment history and look at how competitive your comments are theyre absolutely mind blowing edit
Android,not_removed,thats not close though
Android,not_removed,correct but if i focused on those lamps then the pic overall wouldve become dark
Android,not_removed,correct no large pixels or ois or or lenses to begin with so i tried
Android,not_removed,agreed
Android,not_removed,i was trying to push the limits of this phones camera in the dark
Android,not_removed,i never called the piece of shit i called it fragile because it is and that was in context with comparing to the equally good htc both are top tier phones touchwiz does lag and almost everyone after months of using a samsung flagship says that its just not me i used the price battery and performance to give some leverage to my phone and i always emphasised that it is better for me
Android,not_removed,it is mediocre but focusing speeds are insanely fast the test declares focus speed to be faster than that of
Android,not_removed,agreed
Android,not_removed,hope i dont have to see what not pushing the limits looks like
Android,not_removed,half of randroid hates you and the other half just hasnt met you yet
Android,not_removed,the most optimal quick and best way to avoid light bleed with this phone is focusing somewhere close to those lights
Android,not_removed,atleast i tried weeps silently in a corner
Android,not_removed,i agree with you im a pro photographer so i could mess around with settings and get such pics i bet you would have a hard time taking night pics at all with this phone also the fact that you came from an to a pixel both of which have god tier cameras
Android,not_removed,probably vocal people on theandroid hate me doenst represent the subscribers stop making hate comments and accusing me
Android,not_removed,amount of pixels is the same but samsung camera software probably uses more algorithms with regards to balancing light in the pics the photos dont pixelate in my phone either
Android,not_removed,judging by the way you treat people its only a matter of time before the rest hate you too the fact that people hate you is proof enough of how you act but you totally ignore that for the record though i honestly dont hate you i just really dont like your attitude towards everyone and your constant negative comments about anything other than your glorious xiaomi note that totally gets hours sot minimum youve already been banned from here called everyone pathetic and swore youd never come back and it looks like youre going for another one im also not accusing you of anything im stating literal facts
Android,not_removed,hey man i fucking dislike you too bout time someone shits in your mouth
Android,not_removed,no i didnt use the manual setting ill try another one today at midnight
Android,not_removed,if you are a pro photographer and think these photos are anywhere near good i dont want to see any of your work 🔥🔥🔥
Android,not_removed,no its not that i meant that i can only go this far with such camera hardware story wouldve been different if i shot these pics with my dslr
Android,not_removed,again i never said are horrible or pos they are great but are in a different league one never compares flyweight to heavyweight class big battery and lag free performance together helps though
Android,not_removed,bye bye troll 😊
Android,not_removed,im not burned he misunderstood things
Android,not_removed,the one is worth posting if at all or i could just borrow any of my family members phones for low light scenario they have those flashy phones i dont

Android,not_removed,ctrl f simple thus is life
Android,not_removed,still no santander
Android,not_removed,how does my local credit union ventura county credit union get android pay before simple are you fing kidding me
Android,not_removed,and no not canada either
Android,not_removed,man chase is being idiotic thankfully i have schwab as my backup but for gods sake none of them have pay
Android,not_removed,god damnit schwab
Android,not_removed,wait no capital one but ive been able to use my capital one card with android pay since android pay launched
Android,not_removed,rip canada
Android,not_removed,capital one has their own nfc payment
Android,not_removed,fucking union bank
Android,not_removed,no huntington either
Android,not_removed,how many fucking banks does the us have jesus
Android,not_removed,where you at usaa
Android,not_removed,clueless question but why do folks want their bank to support android pay cant you just associate any credit card with ap bypassing your bank and getting all the rewards and protections of a credit card to boot
Android,not_removed,that was a let down for me
Android,not_removed,im done with chase now im going to apply for a citi doublecash card tired of not being able to use android pay
Android,not_removed,still no natwest in the uk 🙁🙁🙁
Android,not_removed,id prefer new countries but well grats america i guess
Android,not_removed,if android pay is super important to you guys why not get a new credit card
Android,not_removed,so does everyone using android pay not have root or is it easy enough to circumvent these days
Android,not_removed,no bank either
Android,not_removed,my bank is supported now but it wont accept my debit card great
Android,not_removed,security service federal credit union yes finally
Android,not_removed,mcgraw hill will never partner with them 💔
Android,not_removed,still no purdue federal credit union really sucks because i was using google wallet to get mcdonalds on my galaxy nexus
Android,not_removed,chasewtf
Android,not_removed,no chase delta community credit union or georgias own credit union i might as well give up
Android,not_removed,everybody be complaining about no chase support or simple support im just sitting here with ally in my android pay like
Android,not_removed,i havent heard of of these banks
Android,not_removed,all of this matters naught if thy device boasts root
Android,not_removed,i wish my credit union would get with the program already they already support apple pay ffs how hard can it be to support android pay too
Android,not_removed,good job sucking huntington
Android,not_removed,but not my credit union that literally has the word tech in its name blargh
Android,not_removed,what does that mean i have a bank that is not listed but my debit card works just fine with android pay
Android,not_removed,would be more excited about new counties
Android,not_removed,well ive come to terms that my bank will never have android pay even though theyve been supporting apple pay for almost a year puts barrel inside mouth
Android,not_removed,i have becu and its on the list but i just tried to add the card this card cant be used your bank either isnt participating yet or doesnt support this type of card what did i do wrong
Android,not_removed,so how does this even work i havent really paid much attention since it wont be available in my country for at least another decade so you save the credit cards in the phone and then pay through nfc charging directly the card you select
Android,not_removed,whelp looks like ill be getting an iphone instead of a since i dont think canada will be getting android pay this year
Android,not_removed,ive never felt so lucky to have my chase card grandfathered in to android pay sorry everyone else with chase has to suffer this long wait thoughits ridiculous
Android,not_removed,dammit chase just support the app im so tired of this bullshittery saying it will be supported and kicking the can down the road your own proprietary app will tank i guarantee it who fing will use qr codes anymore
Android,not_removed,my reaction on seeing this oh wow chase has to be in there only to come read the top comment
Android,not_removed,am i the only one who was able to add my chase account easily ive been using it for months with android pay
Android,not_removed,im conflicted about this since i cant use android pay due to using xposed if chase actually adds support then i will have a reason to start lamenting about not being able to use android pay
Android,not_removed,any reason you dont switch banks if more people moved banks when they did things we didnt like theyd be forced to improve
Android,not_removed,httpswwwchasepaycom guys chase on android is not happening if you are not happy with that change bank
Android,not_removed,i want simple too but is it really that big a deal for a debit card to be on android personally i use my credit card everywhere and debit only when i need to grab cash so i get the long wait for chase instead
Android,not_removed,yeah i want to switch to simple but wont bother until they add android pay the fact that chase has made more of a commitment by at least saying theyll have it in is shocking
Android,not_removed,simple isnt a bank just a service that comes with a thirdparty bank account they may be at the mercy of their partner bank
Android,not_removed,for fucking real at this point im starting to doubt if itll ever come
Android,not_removed,can someone please explain what is so great about simple their interest rates are at a low which is the lowest interest rate possible
Android,not_removed,you cant use your simple card in android pay i have simple and ive used it before
Android,not_removed,id bet what actually was added was a single whitelabel backend system that a ton of credit unions use
Android,not_removed,i work in financial tech and a lot of these bankscus are our clients we dont have any ties to android pay so im not sure how their model is but i can tell you that we set our prices based on the size of the financial institution so ventura county cu not one of our clients but holy shit their site looks exactly like the other sites ive built this year is more likely to be able to afford android pay than a bigger tier client aside from that what ive found is that the bigger our client is the more branches members etc the more likely they are to want to do things independently our smaller tier clients are happy with our white labeled products and have no issues with our standard packages whereas our bigger clients want a whole bunch of custom shit
Android,not_removed,less bureaucracy from idea to registering with google couldve been done in less than a day for a cu but larger institutions are going to have to go through multiple branches marketing crunching the numbers writing support documents educating employees approval from the board etc
Android,not_removed,checking in
Android,not_removed,probably because simple isnt technically a real bank its an app that comes with a thirdparty bank account im guessing that there may be more logistic issues to work out
Android,not_removed,tfw td bank is listed but not for canada
Android,not_removed,this isnt a csgo update post wicked what are you doing
Android,not_removed,i asked my credit union about android pay and they said they cant discuss it hopefully theyre negotiating at the moment
Android,not_removed,my credit union just added tap pay support conexus credit union fyi it doesnt look like it uses android pay but it does support my nexus i e used it twice so far once at a safeway once at a farmers market
Android,not_removed,hey arent you that guy from the rglobaloffensive subreddit forums
Android,not_removed,seriously every time there is a big update to the list i send them a message on twitter asking why they arent supporting it yet you should do the same haha
Android,not_removed,i just want schwab or fifth third to release android pay support these arent small companies why is it taking them so damn long
Android,not_removed,not on samsung pay either sigh
Android,not_removed,rbc wallet works great for me
Android,not_removed,i hear their slogan is whats in your phone not fucking android pay
Android,not_removed,they support it with their credit cards now it was announced last time but yeahfuck them and everyone elses own nfc app and not supporting others
Android,not_removed,i just wish capital one would add finger print scanner support to their app
Android,not_removed,seriously its not enough to make me want to switch but come on
Android,not_removed,in the same boat i like huntington too much to switch but damn its frustrating
Android,not_removed,huntington bby pls
Android,not_removed,many theyre not as regulated as many other countries so everyone and their brother started their own bank there are literally thousands of them the small ones are slowly being acquired by the big banks though
Android,not_removed,between and
Android,not_removed,theyve been there for a longass time
Android,not_removed,no the credit cards only work if the issuing bank supports android pay when wallet switched over to pay they grandfathered in any card that was activated in wallet already but that doesnt allow the increased security or complete rewards benefits of pay plus if you get a new card number for whatever reason it apparently wont let you update it so then you have no android pay at all
Android,not_removed,yep my credit union still wont support android pay supports fucking android pay and samsung pay fucking lg pay or some shit will probably get support before goddamned android pay
Android,not_removed,yeah fuck that
Android,not_removed,not everyone has good enough credit to get a new card im rebuilding my credit right now after having gone through an unemployment patch a few years back ive applied for other cards chase capital one discover and so far been denied by all of them
Android,not_removed,who needs root these days
Android,not_removed,you can use it with root
Android,not_removed,havent rooted since the days and are fine out of the box for me
Android,not_removed,it started working with root for me a week or so ago
Android,not_removed,hawaii state fcu
Android,not_removed,tweet shame them into supporting it
Android,not_removed,same here bummer
Android,not_removed,my wife and i both use the navy army community credit union and i was able to add my card but not hers weird same bank but mine works and hers doesnt
Android,not_removed,either youre on the n beta thing or the universe hates you and you need to repent
Android,not_removed,basically yeah its a little more complicated under the hood though httpswwwandroidcompay
Android,not_removed,are mobile payment capabilities really the deciding factor
Android,not_removed,i did too for ten days then they sent me a new card and i lost it all
Android,not_removed,wait does a chase credit card not work with android pay any more or is everybody speaking debit i use my sapphire with android pay every day
Android,not_removed,if im not mistaken its essentially using the old google wallet way of making payments not android pays new way by that i mean it doesnt tokenize anything and just uses the card data
Android,not_removed,same here dude 😁
Android,not_removed,i did toountil it expired and i got a new one
Android,not_removed,they say they will support pay by end of they have delayed support to try and get customers on their own system knowing chase they will wait till december pm in hawaii click a button on a computer and say android pay is now enabled
Android,not_removed,id rather switch banks than betray android😂
Android,not_removed,but yet they support samsung pay
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,is it using the actual account or a shell account i have a chase credit card set up but it goes through a google account between the merchant and chase
Android,not_removed,ehh the card is pretty though
Android,not_removed,i have a friend who has been a simple member since they required invites to join and he mentioned that customer service has gotten worse ever since they got acquired by bbva he does mention that the budget stuff that the app and website provides is pretty nice and that its better than what mint provides
Android,not_removed,chase has made no commitment they just say the only reason they are delaying android pay is to hopefully get their customers onto their system which isnt even out yet i bug chase from time to time and get the same canned response every time
Android,not_removed,and the fact that simple does not support joint accounts so those that need joint accounts such as my wife and i we cant fully switch over to simple i use it for side money sort of like my own personal account but its only used to fund my geek purchases i want to use it for my main bills and purchases but i cannot do that until the support joint accounts
Android,not_removed,switch to schwab i cannot list enough good reasons to switch to schwab no atm fee worldwide and us based instant support are awesome
Android,not_removed,its sounds so childish to say it but i kind of agree if i didnt have my other credit cards linked to android pay i would be pretty miffed i still think they have the best banking app and customer service though so im sticking around for now i have messaged them multiple times about android pay and the response is always the same were actively working on supporting android pay at some point in the future theyve been saying that since december
Android,not_removed,their partner bbva compass supports android pay tho
Android,not_removed,honestly convenience their mobile app is the best banking app ive seen and used the customer support whenever ive needed them has been near instant and very friendly the only things i dont like about them are cant deposit cash which im still trying to get used to and the mobile check deposit limitations
Android,not_removed,if youre a student or are someone without enough assets for interest rate to really matter anyway their budgeting tools are very nice i dont even use their debit card since i want my chasediscover rewards but the tool is still immensely intuitive for keeping track of spending much more so than level which is buggy as hell or mint which is just too bloated
Android,not_removed,basically zero fees whatsoever though i use the app and its neat budgeting tools to manage the portion of my paycheck that goes towards fun spending for my actual bills and real savings and stuff though i use ally bank because theres just a lot more features there like checks
Android,not_removed,you forgot building your own version then realising that its fucking stupid after months then support android pay
Android,not_removed,represent p
Android,not_removed,yeah td bank implies the us subsidiary its td canada trust were waiting for
Android,not_removed,they have their own mobile payment solution built in their mobile app so i dont think theyre gonna support android pay anytime soon
Android,not_removed,i dont even have a phone with nfc but im annoyed as hell that neither samsung nor google pay are making any kind of ground here in canada apple brought apple pay here so quick it was like an afterthought whats everyone elses problem
Android,not_removed,or they dont want to make promises
Android,not_removed,i think its more likely that they had no idea either way cs reps never get told anything
Android,not_removed,yes i am that same guy with a sona crush that is also pissed off at the lack of android pay in canada because im a canuck who has been trying to add their stuff to it ever since release
Android,not_removed,why is it less secure the card number it generates is a temporary which means that if a vendor were to be hacked theyd have a card linked to nothing at all in most cases my android pay card is a mastercard whereas the capital one card it is pulling from is a visa also charge shows up on the bill and you get rewards points per dollar to me it seems like a perfect solution generate a onetime only id to perform the transaction charge capital one without a fee and destroy the id
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus pay wont work with any keeps telling me to try again for the past year
Android,not_removed,it was announced last time and then their name was taken down i know because i tried adding my cc and i still get the bankcorp agreement from google wallet so it works for me but doesnt really work in general
Android,not_removed,really thats pretty interesting in the uk of the population probably use the same
Android,not_removed,well shit thanks
Android,not_removed,yeah but i dont think theyre completely supported full functionality is coming in fall according to the usaa website
Android,not_removed,complete rewards benefits of pay thanks for the explanation it sounds like using a cc with ap isnt a normal cc transaction like i was thinking it was followup question if use my cc with ap will i still get the ccs rewards like back when used at restaurants
Android,not_removed,fuck citi they randomly nerfed my citi forward card and wouldnt upgrade it to double cash
Android,not_removed,you could get a contactless debit card
Android,not_removed,well yeah that would be a good reason makes sense are you rebuilding with a secured card
Android,not_removed,if youre not on a nexus device its pretty useful still for example on my note im running amplify to get much better battery life along with some other little stuff here and there like wanam to remove the stupid sfinder and quick connect button from touchwizs notification shade
Android,not_removed,thats like saying i have a car who doesnt have a car these days
Android,not_removed,i use it for httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomfrancodoze
Android,not_removed,but not with xposed right
Android,not_removed,holy shit just checked now my android pay is working edit nevermind now it just lets you open the app not do anything with it great android pay cant be used google is unable to verify that your device or the software running on it is android compatible what i guess cyanogenmod based roms are screwed forever
Android,not_removed,banco popular from puerto rico
Android,not_removed,i thought maybe it was an update thing but my phone says the app is up to date hopefully becu gets it worked out in the next couple days
Android,not_removed,so is there something i need to do or just wait
Android,not_removed,im not n i thought the universe and i were on talking terms i dont know what i did wrong this time im always having to apologize damn it
Android,not_removed,it really is a huge convenience especially when a lot of us got so use to using google wallet it was a huge blow to me that i had to start swiping my card again after they shut down wallet for nfc payments
Android,not_removed,contactless is stupidly convenient in canada almost everyone accepts it at a high level android and ios has pretty much the same features so i might as well get the one that gets me a little more
Android,not_removed,ive got an iphone and i think ive used apple pay like times total most places near me dont even have chip card readers so im sure it will take years for them to get nfc terminals
Android,not_removed,my wife and i love mobile pay its become a thing of ours to track places that accept either apple or android pay she has an iphone it even influences our shopping habits at times not that it should just a little thing we do i left chase for boa for it
Android,not_removed,my card can already do contacless payments so i dont really care only when i lose my wallet it could help
Android,not_removed,same happened to me with capital one sad day
Android,not_removed,you might be grandfathered in like me i have a slate newer chase credit cards do not work on android pay
Android,not_removed,essentially yes they assigned me a bancorp card number that gets passed to merchants via nfc then a charge for goognfc shows up on my statement
Android,not_removed,funny thing is their own system hasnt rolled out yet
Android,not_removed,wells fargo just came out with a cash back credit card that gives you cash back if you use android pay for the first months edit i have wells for checking but chase always had better sign up promotions and rewards if wells offers a sign up bonus im there
Android,not_removed,switched to boa last year bc of it the csr asked why i switched and i told them lack of android pay i told them again after they sent me survey via email not sure if they even look at the stuff my local credit union just implemented android pay months ago its great i have my two main cards with me at all times
Android,not_removed,i thought the app theyre working on is a direct competitor with android pay not samsung pay
Android,not_removed,its just my chase debit card
Android,not_removed,its white so it doesnt stay pretty for long trust me
Android,not_removed,ive had no problems at all with the customer service ive contacted them a few times for either questions or small errors and theyve always been very helpful maybe comparatively theyve been worse for your friend but theyre still pretty good overall
Android,not_removed,they forced me to close my account because i am taking an extended holiday overseas i studied abroad two years ago which they had no issue with but nope cant go on holiday goodbye simple i was also a member when they required invites
Android,not_removed,maybe i havent been a member long enough only years but simple customer service has always been outstanding for me i had a chase account for years their customer service was never as helpful or as cordial as the folks at simple this is all anecdotal though i suppose
Android,not_removed,im about to start bugging them to get on board with android seriously like hell if im gonna install their app and have multiple apps easier to switch a bank 😂
Android,not_removed,thats my point simple hasnt even given out a year theyve given less of a commitment than chase has
Android,not_removed,and theyve only been their partner bank for like weeks officially why waste time implementing android pay on bancorp when eventually everyone will be moved over to bbva compass accounts
Android,not_removed,can you elaborate on the mobile check deposit limitations
Android,not_removed,interesting sounds like stubbornness from the bigger fis then
Android,not_removed,i cri evry tim
Android,not_removed,pls let me hope
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus android pay works for me with my amex do you not have marshmallow yet
Android,not_removed,i added my newer cc to android pay months ago when it was announced capital one whereas previously i could not and it was not in google wallet so it is not grandfathered ergo it supports it now it still does it through bancorp but so did discover for a while there but that is irrelevant and an implementation detail mostly
Android,not_removed,yeah in canada its mostly the biggest banks with the last using credit unions or a couple of other online or smaller banks
Android,not_removed,you do realize that the united states is times bigger than the uk right different states with different regulations only a few banks are nationwide most regions have their own banks
Android,not_removed,i bet it will happen when they complete the switch from credit and debit mastercards to visa
Android,not_removed,if the issuing bank officially supports ap yes you will if your card is a grandfathered card from the wallet days then maybe yes maybe no depending on how your bank actually handles the transaction there was some limited support for rewards with wallet iirc but it wasnt reliable by any means
Android,not_removed,bank doesnt offer it
Android,not_removed,totally except not
Android,not_removed,no closed doesnt work with it
Android,not_removed,ive been able to use it a couple times in the last week i used to get the same message youre seeing
Android,not_removed,hsfcu is having similar issues i can add credit card but it wont verify and debit card goes through the setup but then says its not supported
Android,not_removed,maybe its a preemptive punishment
Android,not_removed,every place ive been to in the last months has had chip readers most are disabled though and still use the swipe
Android,not_removed,seems like this block goes back to i didnt add my card until november maybe its on a card by card basis either way i feel lucky i love android pay and use it all the time
Android,not_removed,but then you dont get the rewards points either
Android,not_removed,or just get the citi doublecash card which isnt time or android pay restricted
Android,not_removed,i mean technically apple pay android pay samsung pay chase pay etc would all be direct competitors
Android,not_removed,implying i have money to use the card
Android,not_removed,shrug mine still looks pretty great after a year i guess it depends on where its stored
Android,not_removed,wait what the shit i literally just entered a new address into their site and it updated in like minutes so proof of anything needed
Android,not_removed,sure there are two you have to do mobile deposits before your deposit limit is taken from to this affected me when i received my tax return i had to send my check to them in the mail and it took about or days to get them to them and clear thankfully when i contacted customer support about this they told me that next time to send it by fedex with a tracking number on it if i have a tracking number they can usually help a bit more its just an inconvenience that theres a limit to how big of a check you can deposit without having to mail the check if your account has negative balance for whatever reason mobile checking is disabled they want you to put money into the account to enable mobile checking but if mobile checking is the only way you add money to your account youre kind of screwed youll have to mail the check now this isnt much of a problem if you finance your money well or have direct deposit from a job but its still an issue if it happens to you
Android,not_removed,but every time i click on android pay and want to add a new cardi keep getting an error sorry something went wrong and only given the option to cancel or try again infinite loop my rei membership card is there from my profilebut cant add anything elsethat error keeps popping up i tried uninstalling reinstallingabout times
Android,not_removed,they offer contactless credit cards but not contactless debit cards
Android,not_removed,yeah i think a good number of us really are talking about xposed when were talking about ap working with root
Android,not_removed,whats interesting is that the bank hasnt made any announcements even though theyre aware its been a highly requested addition they made a statement a few months ago they they were working on it but now that its out no official news
Android,not_removed,chase and most banks just want you using their credit cards theyre less concerned about the channel
Android,not_removed,is apple pay a competitor though to the rest you cant use androidsamsung pay on an iphone and vice versa to me competitor implies you can actually choose between the competition
Android,not_removed,awesome thanks man i signed up for simple a few days ago just waiting for my card so you had me worried but i dont think itll be an issue appreciate it
Android,not_removed,odd contact google support
Android,not_removed,they dont offer that either my credit card is through a party other than my bank i actually have two bank accounts right now ally and alliant credit union i joined alliant because ill be dropping ally prior to them just being added to android pay they said they had no plans in place for offering nfc payment support through either apple pay or android pay this has been their rhetoric for the lastyear or so along with not offering chippin cards again no timeline for when they will be offered and not having a way to deposit cash i decided that id switch banks to somewhere alliant that offers android pay chip and pin cards and gives me a way to deposit cash
Android,not_removed,same with my bank just one day my grandfathered google wallet card stopped working called them and they said they enabled it but it had problems so they disabled it i just called them to activate my cards and my debit can now be added they said give it min to activate
Android,not_removed,yes but they are spending moneyresources on developing chase pay so they want you to use it
Android,not_removed,depends on whether or not chase pay works on ios
Android,not_removed,not that concerned
Android,not_removed,chases big play with chase pay is getting giant merchants like starbucks to move over to their paymenttech rails for running all their credit card transactions on the merchant processing side
Android,not_removed,some best buy locations in the us already have the demo units on display so i figured to have some time with them bixby seems kinda neat but at the same time it does feel like a google now goggles mix that does not seem all that is cracked up to be go figure i took some pictures of the orchid grey and the arctic silver to get a better idea on its looks i have to say the grey has a nice purple hue to the surrounding frame of the phone while the silver is almost mirrorlike the location this was set up at was at a new jersey best buy location at a samsung experience display chances are that they will be available at similar locations soon if not already the woman that i was talking to on the matter said that it was set up over night at my location as for how it feels and looks its pretty damn good i have to say the edges were not hard to hold and the device had a solid feeling all around as for the screen of course its great given that its samsungs own screens responsiveness was snappy given the ui it had but of course how it will hold up over time remains to be seen overall it could very well be a good enough device to make me upgrade from my nexus that said i will wait until rootcustom roms can find its way to the and see if google will pull something special out with whatever next iteration of the pixel series will be the latter of which by the time that happens the will likely be slightly cheaper

Android,not_removed,looks interesting im very new to the sub so ive only stumbled upon this post after searching for a good reddit app does it just sync an entire sub or do you have to pick out the posts you want to save for later
Android,not_removed,wow looking forward to this
Android,not_removed,thanks no it does an entire sub and you just set how much storage youd like it to use and it works its magic in the background
Android,not_removed,id love to test drive this app with rnosleep sync the app during the night with the house wifi then just breeze on through the next morning without worrying about data chargers o
Android,not_removed,hahaha thats brilliant
Android,not_removed,agreed best samsung experience by far
Android,not_removed,they need to make battery improvements and must provide the february security update as its not arrived yet i am using it and its a great phone with premium design
Android,not_removed,deserved
Android,not_removed,im loving my edge and the nougat update has really made the phone feel smoother my main complaint is battery life it has never been great and the nougat update has made it a tad bit worse fortunately i dont use my phone too much at work and it always makes it through the day before i need to charge
Android,not_removed,well deserved
Android,not_removed,my phone
Android,not_removed,i did as well at my bestbuy the screen was great the ergonomics were surprisingly good even better than that the feels less chunky in my hand than the regular more stable than the the buttons on the bottom had some kind of haptictactile feedback that mimiced the physical home button quite well sadly the fingerprint reader was just as akward as i expected it to be especially being right handed im sure most will get used to it but the camera smudge potential is real i have a ill probably upgrade to a over the side my side the bezels arent that large and most everything else is similar but well see when reviews come out
Android,not_removed,can it be used one handed like reach all corners doesnt seem like it
Android,not_removed,did you check to see which apps you could uninstall what apps were preinstallled ie what was the bloatware
Android,not_removed,can it make calls
Android,not_removed,lucky for me i was the first one to touch the phone and peel off the platic
Android,not_removed,you need some lotion my dude
Android,not_removed,does the screen feel as cramped as it looks
Android,not_removed,yeah i mean if you can get the edge at a good price i would go for it since there isnt anything too different between the two minus the screen and bixby
Android,not_removed,there is a one handed mode but using the regular software one handed is a no go
Android,not_removed,if its anything like previous samsung phones there is probably a one handed mode i cant see them removing that feature
Android,not_removed,the one handed is okay its the same height as my droid turbo but skinnier the is definitely going to be a bit trickier its the same width as my turbo but taller
Android,not_removed,its a streach to reach the status bar one handed without triggering one handed mode but less than youd think the way the phone fits in the hand at least for me makes it easier than i expected
Android,not_removed,what i can remember was facebook instagram and of course samsungs own version of the clock calender etc
Android,not_removed,the demo phones at best buy are special live demo units with a bunch of apps and games added that dont normally come on it out of the box
Android,not_removed,now that you ask i think samsung focused more on the screen and bixby and forgot to have it make calls s
Android,not_removed,yeah lol new york always gets cold
Android,not_removed,the screen doesnt feel cramped in the slightest in fact its quite the opposite
Android,not_removed,big hand master race
Android,not_removed,can i change the volume
Android,not_removed,halfway competed avoid tolls is better than none thank you google finnaly
Android,not_removed,id like it as a detachable accessory for the moto z or something along those lines current phone ergonomics are already a nightmare to be adding more stuff that isnt in use in at least of the time youre holding the phone
Android,not_removed,i wouldnt mind an xperia play with my a inch qhd screen and a nvidia chip so basically a smaller nintendo switch with worse games but with phone capabilities
Android,not_removed,i would probably buy one if it came out it wouldnt even have to have a special gpu or anything as i would use it for emulation and mobile processors now are good enough
Android,not_removed,inch or display nvidia soc combo external sd card make it compatible with the psp and vita library and im buying that thing on day one
Android,not_removed,can we call it the playstation portable xperia vita play
Android,not_removed,would you purchase a phone with a similar gaming oriented setup yes as long as its an actual handheld consolesuccessor to the vita if so what improvements over the xperia plays design would you make what would you carry over from the xperia plays design i would scrap the xp design and take the psp gos design and add thumbsticks and buttons and the ps button also make the screen bigger to around inches what would be your spec requirements inch amoled screen gb ram sd card slot game cartridge slot usb type c good camera nvidia chip front facing speakers mah or more battery gb internal storage dual os androidplaystation os have the price start at unlocked and also have it available through all carriers target performance fps for games id also trash the xperia name and capitalize on the playstation brand and just call it the playstation phone
Android,not_removed,a moto mod would be a better solution
Android,not_removed,i remember i was so close to trading my nexus for a play in but now i would buy one with sd and of ram without blinking
Android,not_removed,yes yes yes all i want in a phone is an updated xperia play i miss playing games on my phone but touch controls are terrible bluetooth gamepads are too much of a hassletoo bulky to carry around i mostly play emulators and the xperia play was a dream phone but its so old now im currently looking forward to the bb mercury so i can use a keyboard again and buttons for muh emulators
Android,not_removed,didnt even read the op id buy it in a heart beat fun fact my roommates xperia broke and he still uses his xperia play
Android,not_removed,fuck yes
Android,not_removed,absolutely with a modern soc and a screen id instantly jump on it preferably around or less
Android,not_removed,itd be an incredibly niche device as much as i adore the idea of physical keys for gaming on the go maybe a moto mod or a kickstarted limited production device
Android,not_removed,id actually rather it had a slide out keyboard horizontally which could then maybe be used as a gamepad also
Android,not_removed,if anything the biggest selling proposition isnt the hardware as with console gaming the games library and its availability makes all the difference xperia play didnt fare well on this front and emulators alone wont help next whatever hardware and software settings it uses it must achieve minimum at all times anything less is unacceptable stuttering skipped frames these things are very noticeable during gaming there also needs to be some way of outputting video to an external display eg usbc dp altmode games gobble storage space internal is the absolute minimum being the step up and the expandable side should be ufs too much internal storage only makes the whole device priced beyond the reach of most users battery needs to be minimum not because of the leaky state of android software but because gaming is very powerintensive to begin with everything else is negotiable
Android,not_removed,yes depending on the price for id rather just buy an actual console
Android,not_removed,my original is still in pretty fantastic condition the sony ericsson circle thing is cracked down the middle but still works great even did the led indicator mod for it if i didnt have a ps vita i would probably buy one but i have no real need for it
Android,not_removed,xperia play was my first smart phone while i loved the gamepad everything else about it was just no weak specs vs the competition left to die on gb and the tiny internal storage was a pain i didnt realise how bad it was until i actually started to understand what you could do on a smart phone moved to more normal phones and bought a controller like the moga and even the ps controllers but the portability didnt feel as great as the play screen ram the upcoming sd or a more powerthermal friendly nvidia soc storage minimum preferable whatever battery size for an average of gaming on a single charge dual front facing stereo speakers and most of all the same level of support the z phones had and maybe even a more stock like os hint hint put that concept firmware to use sony
Android,not_removed,no but if i had a moto z i might by a mod like that
Android,not_removed,what i want is a flagship xperia with an attachable ps controller case that turns it into a makeshift vita then give it the digital store of pspv games and its set the xperias already have streaming capabilities so theyre covered in that regard
Android,not_removed,bought the original would buy again with topnotch specs and omnibalance design
Android,not_removed,if sony had did a similar situation like the switch with the vita detachable controls i would have bought three i already bought two of them just because of how badges of s system it was if i could have left my phone at home and used that for my lte browsing thats life even without the detachable controls i would be totally down for it if it had flagship level phone components
Android,not_removed,i would buy the much
Android,not_removed,yes its still my favorite phone ive ever had
Android,not_removed,httpineedaphone approved by reddit
Android,not_removed,god no
Android,not_removed,yes and no if it were to be my only phone id need it to have every single feature of the nexus with updated internals and preferably have the physical gamepad buttons be modular since slide out buttons would add a considerable amount of girth in saying that though there are plenty of tablet solutions with readily available controller mounts that already work just fine with bigger screens better speakers and much longer battery life so why do it on a phone at all
Android,not_removed,my brother has one and he still uses it to play on it once and a while and just to fool around and he loves it honestly tho i probably would never buy one now or ever mainly bc the bluetooth controller market is pretty big and you can get one for cheap an ipega brand chinese one will run you like and work just fine is it the same form factor no obviously but i think if you can pocket a phone thats as thick as the play then having a controller with you extra is not gonna be an issueespecially with how phones are huge nowadays anyway on the other hand at least for me i had to realise i just dont use it i got the chinese controller but my daily commute is multipart with getting on and off of buses so i cant really use it on the go and i have zero reasons to use it at home really theres a lot of other stuff i could bring up but i think i already rambled long enough
Android,not_removed,id have to say no for myself particularly because i am getting the nintendo switch in a month and since it is fairly portable i wouldnt see myself buying something on top of that i cannot wait to get my hands on it
Android,not_removed,i wish there was a way to get a controller like that on my
Android,not_removed,maybe not a phone but a tablet or portable device like the original nvidia shield id happily buy one for if it had decent specs
Android,not_removed,i want a phone like a refresh of the compact that works on verizon
Android,not_removed,yeah some sort of very thin attachment that slides out for use like the xperia had and doubles as a case would be perfect
Android,not_removed,youd have to imagine sony would allow some video game streaming to the device games via their game streaming service remote play and potential for downloadable vita games wouldnt be impossible if an updated xperia play were to come out
Android,not_removed,first thing i was searching after i saw nintendo switch was if it can run android basically with android it would be my dream device
Android,not_removed,if it had vita compatibility id get one in a heartbeat itd mean i wouldnt have to deal with the proprietary vita memory cards and could use a regular uhs micro sd card which would cost less and reduce load times and also the games that had some performance problems on vita could be brute forced to run well itd also be nice for them to use all those psn titles they already have up for on something new instead of seeing them slowly disappear or fade into obscurity as nothing new can play them
Android,not_removed,there are psp emulators now
Android,not_removed,the vita might have some issues with comparability due to the back touchpad support having said that several vita tv compatible games may work
Android,not_removed,as the owner of an nvidia shield portable it checks most of those boxes already it also has built in physical controls and a mah battery
Android,not_removed,playsportable xviplay
Android,not_removed,playstation phone yeah but the vita is still technically a thing and i guess sony wouldnt want to make it look redundant
Android,not_removed,hello where is the proofs
Android,not_removed,that is amazing that little guy keeps on ticking what rom are you using
Android,not_removed,but a console is no portable you cant compare the and ps vita for example they are not the same thing
Android,not_removed,mine is also running pretty well only maintenance i had to do was replace the plagued flex ribbon cable which was pretty easy overall
Android,not_removed,sounds like something that will be dead in months after launch
Android,not_removed,you can already do remote play since the
Android,not_removed,there are quite a lot of android tablets like that i know jxd sells some pretty decent ones for and is good for emulation
Android,not_removed,ppsspp works like a charm i ran monster hunter portable persona portable dbz etc without an issue on a nexus there are some stuff that wont start obviously but its wonderful for what it is
Android,not_removed,do they run of games also emulators dont add buttons to the device
Android,not_removed,add a back touch pad then were only dreaming about this device after all
Android,not_removed,or they can get rid of the vita and ps phone can play vita game a man can dream right
Android,not_removed,i remember seeing threads for that everywhere im super happy i never had to bother with that
Android,not_removed,yeah but if you had a xperia play you dont need to get an adaptor to stick your phone onto your controller
Android,not_removed,metal gear solid peace walker runs like crap on my oneplus i wonder if its the rom or cant run graphic intensive psp titles
Android,not_removed,they run a whole lot they certainly run more games than an official sony gaming phone would because right now it doesnt exist and you can use a dualshock to have physical controls
Android,not_removed,wow thats pretty impressive the rom must have some magic optimisation
Android,not_removed,well it reached its funding goal successfully on kickstarter and are now taking preorders on indiegogo bet that it never gets released plenty of kickstarters get funded then disappearrun out of money
Android,not_removed,the battery has capacity and you can attach another battery to the unit hours of regular use per battery wrong per battery but the soc isnt the only component sucking down battery power while its in use youre not getting hours at most its hours if youre willing to compromise your gaming experience in the process most liion batteries do not come in nominal also is heavy as fuck at this point youre better off repurposing a surface pro as a gaming tablet the soc is only thats ultrabook territory and those require active cooling it uses copper foam passive cooling technology what the fuck this is just wrong on so many levels when they release more efficient cpu modules heat wont be an issue in the future assuming this product is supported longer than a few years look at nexbit even they had to sell themselves to a bigger company to secure more funding for their ambitions this shit isnt happening
Android,not_removed,yeah but if you had a xperia play you dont need to get an adaptor to stick your phone onto your controller but my connects to my phone via bluetooth
Android,not_removed,it ran like crap locked fps but thats bc the psp limitations not the snap i ran it on the desktop ppsspp and it was the same with a core
Android,not_removed,and you can use a dualshock to have physical controls im dreaming of a xperia play successor why would i want a for it
Android,not_removed,yeah but where are you resting your phone i got the official adaptor back when i got my which made it so much easier to use remote play
Android,not_removed,because you can make your own with your existing phone
Android,not_removed,stock rom or something else stock kernel or something else are you swapping any ram on the sd card
Android,not_removed,that is amazing
Android,not_removed,that does look pretty great i have to admit i didnt believe it before i saw the vid really impressive
Android,not_removed,sort of well see if it ever actually reaches backers plenty of kickstarters go yeah were in production now then end up bankrupt and go sorry cant deliver anything and ride off into the sunset
Android,not_removed,oh i see i misinterpreted i thought you were talking about an adapter to connect wirelessly with that being said then the xperia play would be more convenient
Android,not_removed,i dont think the original xperia play has a marshmallow stock rom
Android,not_removed,no gapps now it all makes sense
Android,not_removed,dont know if you sent the wrong link but it says there no forum posts
Android,not_removed,just like every other kickstarter failed project backer
Android,not_removed,well see when are they supposed to be shipping also im extremely sceptical there are some glaring red flags hour battery life out of a battery not a chance with a minimum tdp chip just that chip alone and excluding the fact the battery wont actually be lower watthour capacity and not including all the other things that require power such as the storage and screen youre looking at hours run time at the most then theres the actual price they let you pick or linux as an os how are they getting those windows licenses a retail copy of home is that leaves them with knock off another for a ssd and youre looking at at most for the entire of the rest of the system plus rd and manufacturing costs not a chance in hell thats profitable
Android,not_removed,mtklogger application that logs personal information to storage without user consent can be started by thirdparty application without user consent isnt such an application a securityprivacy issue in and of itself
Android,not_removed,wheres the patch for the bootloops
Android,not_removed,lg fix nothing improve nothing and block dirtycow root method gg
Android,not_removed,any word on how this will affect rooted devices
Android,not_removed,nice but im still on the october patch level fu lg for not caring about security and updates on a carrier and branding free never ever will i buy a lg device
Android,not_removed,can somebody explain the comments which have been deleted
Android,not_removed,now if they could just stop their phones from spontaneously bricking themselves with bootlooping
Android,not_removed,did they fix the bootloops
Android,not_removed,indeed anyone knows if this on stock android too
Android,not_removed,ive seen that several times did not pay any attentionto it hmm must comb repos
Android,not_removed,bootloop and whats that with lg
Android,not_removed,i like the smell of bootloops in the morning
Android,not_removed,the only thing the last update for the was block rooting i imagine this is probably no different
Android,not_removed,it borks root dont update to
Android,not_removed,not an english speaker but shouldnt it be affect here
Android,not_removed,what bootloops lg probably
Android,not_removed,im on an unbranded and i havent had a security patch since july
Android,not_removed,fu even more as it is still on september patch level and not october worst after sales support ever even samsung is better then lg
Android,not_removed,maybe a book loop meme chain gone wrong
Android,not_removed,replace the r in reddit in the url with a c so instead of wwwredditcom it should be wwwcedditcom
Android,not_removed,security is just a myth oh man this guy lemme get the popcorn really quick
Android,not_removed,most arent remote
Android,not_removed,most of these are not known before they are patched this is exactly how you want security patches to work
Android,not_removed,all security bulletins from any major os looks like this if the maintainers bother to show what has been changed do you think theres actually something bullet proof
Android,not_removed,why so edgy
Android,not_removed,from the full posting for that issue it only affects devices with mediatek chips so most phones wont have the software running i would assume
Android,not_removed,i havent used an lg rom in a while but i recall being able to use it just fine without accepting the eula wouldnt this make it illegal
Android,not_removed,autorestart™
Android,not_removed,neither of my lg phones or has had the bootloop problem but an iphone i got my daughter for christmas has it and im having to return it apparently its not just lg that has the problem
Android,not_removed,im assuming an lg coffee mug boot loop would dump your morning coffee out as soon as you poured it no warranty or lawsuit could remedy thatblood would have to be shed
Android,not_removed,i know its sad my bootlooped this week barely weeks postwarranty and now i have to send it in hoping that theyll take responsibility they wont were using jump next week to upgrade my wifes just in case its a bummer because i like lgs hardware a lot but i dont feel comfortable owning their devices anymore
Android,not_removed,my gf loves lg phones and was going to buy a in the next few months two days ago her started bootlooping i ordered her a pixel xl shes probably never going back to lg which is sad because she has always gone with them they really need to get their shit together
Android,not_removed,yeah no more lg phones for me my monitor is really nice from them though fairly certain those cant bl
Android,not_removed,the phone will try to boot up but fails and tries again and again you will never be able to to fully turn on the phone its a common problem with lg phones that i think started with the
Android,not_removed,yeah dirtycow was a root method but it was capable of more malicious things than helping to root your phone
Android,not_removed,has anyone released a phone where you could root without an exploit cyanogenmod does include turning on root functionality in developer settings but how about an oem
Android,not_removed,they could have at least improved the auto camera mode accuracy
Android,not_removed,it wasnt to just block root this exploit was discovered before the came out its a security patch that honestly took to long to push out to the
Android,not_removed,yup
Android,not_removed,it was affect then i got nervous it was wrong so i changed it
Android,not_removed,they taste so good tho i especially like the salty flavour
Android,not_removed,its something
Android,not_removed,my sony phone released in september had the july patch until the nougat update
Android,not_removed,thanks i didnt know that but i knew it existed finally i learned
Android,not_removed,from a semantic point of view i kind of agree security is just a myth using the word security is just a terrible choice overall should really be assurance you can never really know how secure a system is just some assurance of it being secure using some form of metrics this guy sounds like a troll but you could make the argument that a lot of android devices dont get security patches and there isnt much an average user can do to change that except upgrade devices so yeah in those cases there is no security and theyre completely exposed to attackers
Android,not_removed,well you want them to work faster actually they should roll them out to everyone more quickly not wait an entire month
Android,not_removed,theyll probably argue opening shrink wrap constitutes agreement i would say such an argument is bs but what do i know about law
Android,not_removed,whiletrue autorestartlgedition
Android,not_removed,a lot of phones have the potential to bootloop but lgs phone seem to bootloop at a high rate relative to other companies but this is really just speculation we dont have stats
Android,not_removed,ive had lg models never had this its just a circlejerk that perpetuates here
Android,not_removed,yeah after my first bootloop and all the issues i had dealing with lg about it then reading how so many others were having similar issues across several of their devices it set my mind pretty clear to never purchase another lg phone maybe product but i have had good lg tvs in the past
Android,not_removed,thank you
Android,not_removed,i read about this after owning a for about a year and a half and was really surprised just under a month before i become eligible for an upgrade it happened was really looking at the lg as a replacement but not i am staying far away from lg for at least a year after this issue seems cleared up
Android,not_removed,motorola phones let you unlock your bootloader with a key from their website provided all the tools and everything
Android,not_removed,the nexus line just unlock your phone through fastboot install twrp and flash supersu
Android,not_removed,oneplus allows bootloader unlocking which makes custom recovery installation and rooting easy also it does not void your warranty also at least on older meizu phone firmwares you could root via system settings then phones security app worked like superusersupersu app
Android,not_removed,htc one x and maybe later models too
Android,not_removed,i had a galaxy and was able to root by just flashing a different kernel via kies
Android,not_removed,nexuspixel phones or any phone with an unlocked bootloader
Android,not_removed,i think htc mostly allows you to you void your warranty instantly of course though
Android,not_removed,if a phone allows rooting it cant pass the google certification and thus cant ship with gapps etc
Android,not_removed,no because that would require too much work for oems who would stop providing timely updates by having a set schedule it gives oems time to implement these fixes on a regular basis
Android,not_removed,no because that would require too much work for oems who would stop providing timely updates by having a set schedule it gives oems time to implement these fixes on a regular basis
Android,not_removed,removed if you cant be civil within our​ community youll be looking at a timeout first warning
Android,not_removed,autorestartlgedition
Android,not_removed,we dont need stats we got tha cirklejerk
Android,not_removed,its crazy how much phones seem to bootloop these days i flashed the hell out of my i must have flashed roms like literally times and the only bootloops i knew of back then were soft bootloops that could easily be fixed not these hard bootloops these days
Android,not_removed,its a real problem but lg keeps fixing them free which is pretty solid we need a strong lg but this cloud over their heads isnt helping fingers crossed they knock the out of the park with closer to stock os
Android,not_removed,i really want a lg too but after seeing my gfs be sent back twice for bootloop i am staying far away
Android,not_removed,i am root
Android,not_removed,sony does this still
Android,not_removed,htc did that with my shitty ass desire c way back in the day
Android,not_removed,the current ones dont
Android,not_removed,of course though why if your power button headphone jack or volume keys break down its fucked up that they can deny warranty just because you tinkered with the software
Android,not_removed,because android does have more security flaws no matter to what you compare it to two really major fixes allowing much faster updating and better stability would be making all the hardware drivers were less of a blob and more universal and then removing android specific stuff from the kernel making it more easily updateable android devices are on incredibly old kernel versions drivers are an issue for especially from qualcomm stuff its the reason google has not chromebooks with qualshit they cant keep their stuff uptodate
Android,not_removed,just because they wouldnt like it doesnt make the current state of affairs okay in the rest of the software world a patch is made in a few days and delivered not waiting an entire month between their patch and the staged roll out staged roll out is far too slow for starters even on nexus and pixel and a set schedule isnt a good thing its not about scheduling its about delivery and demand when theres a demand ie an exploit you get it fixed and merge in the changes for oems this merging part is trivial unless theyre doing things very wrong hackers dont wait for you to fit it in our patch schedule
Android,not_removed,my was able to charge and it booted when i heated it up once it started cooling down it would start bootlooping again did give me enough time to reset it though
Android,not_removed,we are root
Android,not_removed,i am groot
Android,not_removed,so does motorola
Android,not_removed,oh i dont know im just speaking from the last time i looked at it
Android,not_removed,they do
Android,not_removed,the design of android right now doesnt really allow more security either
Android,not_removed,do you realize that these are not zero day exploits these exploits have not been released to the public yet
Android,not_removed,unless youre on att with a and youve upgraded to mmthen we are most definitely not root cries
Android,not_removed,yes i believe that was the joke
Android,not_removed,that doesnt falsify my comment does it
Android,not_removed,but they arent sold here for whatever reason
Android,not_removed,not sure if things are different because im in the uk but i was able to return two rooted htc devices due to hardware issues due to the purple camera tint issue and an that would shut off at battery after a few months
Android,not_removed,huh as soon as a patch for an exploit is released its public i was arguing for less staged roll out for that very reason youre vulnerable from the first device patched that month until the last is patched
Android,not_removed,eu has consumer friendly warranty laws
Android,not_removed,the uk isnt part of the eu tho
Android,not_removed,they havent officially left yet as far as i know plus he was talking about past events
Android,not_removed,hey guys just wanted to say thanks for the post really humbled to have people sharing it on reddit d ash
Android,not_removed,even if you dont care about the mini every single video from ash is worth the watch its so refreshing to see an actual cinematographer doing reviews you dont get eye candy for the sake of eye candy you get a true form of storytelling
Android,not_removed,this guy is so underrated people get a hard on over mkbhd and while he is good ash produces to a different gear
Android,not_removed,wow hes good really sets himself apart from other reviews truly unique only complaint i have is i wish he spent more time on the camera that was way too brief
Android,not_removed,a review without talking about battery life also how are the speakers compared to the axon
Android,not_removed,they couldnt have at least used a jesus this device is trash
Android,not_removed,great videos man i subbed last night after going through your video history im curious to know how much time you spend on these videos the production quality is superb
Android,not_removed,always enjoy your videos thanks for sharing them with us
Android,not_removed,ash my boya freelance reviewer but you have beautiful taste keep it up man you got a special flair to your videos
Android,not_removed,his videos have some of the best production value and hes pretty charismatic cant get enough
Android,not_removed,its not trash its just not perfect at this size and price i expected more
Android,not_removed,its definitely not trash i would have liked to see a myself but at least its not the htc desire with a snapdragon
Android,not_removed,the issue is that the phrase has to be long enough to be identifiable in quiet and louder environments additionally for trusted voice it has to be long enough to identify your voice in particular
Android,not_removed,it isnt long its just cumbersome its just an awkward phrase hi alexa would be just as many syllables but much much easier to say
Android,not_removed,google pls
Android,not_removed,the google home promo video shows it being activated with both okay google and hey google so they seem to be adding other options
Android,not_removed,im okay with the number of syllables but saying google quickly without muddling the sounds is a bit difficult im not sure how it is for other accents but as a us southerner i find myself having to repeat myself three or four times to get okay google to active
Android,not_removed,scottish accent ello computer
Android,not_removed,yeah i guess that makes sense what about something like hey google
Android,not_removed,its only one more than hey siri i think its fine in future they might just go with assistant similar to the computer command from the star trek series
Android,not_removed,id like an option for everyone to specify their own personal phrase or sound whistle
Android,not_removed,its only one syllable more than hey siri lets not get crazy here
Android,not_removed,my vote is for wahdupgoog
Android,not_removed,hey g do xyz
Android,not_removed,it is with home
Android,not_removed,i sounded it out to hear the syllables and it popped up lol
Android,not_removed,ok g
Android,not_removed,more syllables helps it not go off accidently
Android,not_removed,i think just google would suffice for me
Android,not_removed,newphrase glasshole beats siri anyday not as emasculatings
Android,not_removed,thismy ok google already gets triggered too much as it isi couldnt imagine something shorter obviously the best solution is to let us set our own triggerbut im not sure google would let that happensaying ok google is basically advertising for google
Android,not_removed,i think thats more to the point than what i said thank you
Android,not_removed,and google will respond with sigh what now
Android,not_removed,ok gooby
Android,not_removed,interesting maybe the know the awkwardness
Android,not_removed,im totally doing this the day they introduce custom voice activation commands
Android,not_removed,theyre already doing that
Android,not_removed,symbols like this
Android,not_removed,people use the word google in everyday life far too much for that to ever be practical
Android,not_removed,also a user might set it to something stupid that isnt distinguishable from other words for example someone sets it to billy and then your phone triggers because you say this is great chili really or lets go to philly then they blame google because it doesnt work right i cant think of many things that sound like ok google and could get confused
Android,not_removed,i have mine set to bridge to engineering just said that instead of ok google when training my voice
Android,not_removed,i have an echo at home and it gets triggered all the time by conversations devices with always on okay google triggers almost never get triggered
Android,not_removed,y u do dis
Android,not_removed,even with okay google everyday speech gets confused by google now enough that the wife and i have begun referring to schmoogle in conversation

Android,not_removed,double tap to wake seems really popular but i much prefer motos wave to wake implementation on the moto x devices
Android,not_removed,yeah i love the double tap to wake especially since my lock button is on the back of my phone really helpful for when i have my phone laying on a flat surface the fingerprint sensor is really good on my from my experience the six inch screen is bigger than most phones without being too big at least for my hands ive had no problems with battery life although i never have to charge my phone because i have a second batterycharger a few of the main reasons i bought the was because of the interchangeable battery screen size and at the time it had the best camera on the market that said an acquaintance of mine was telling me he was having problems with his battery life even after purchasing the same batterycharger combo i had purchased
Android,not_removed,what are the positives of rooting negatives ive never rooted an android but ive jb an iphone and it slowed it down at least thirty percent im sure
Android,not_removed,yes i love being able to control the telecable box from my phone via ir blaster why all phones dont have it is beyond me
Android,not_removed,surprisingly i never used this feature moto display is pretty cool though
Android,not_removed,front facing speakers are brilliant never had them on a phone before until i got the it makes watching anything on the good screen just that bit better
Android,not_removed,yeah i much prefer the android os being able to enable developer options is one of my favourite aspects i immediately set the animation scale to which everyone should do it makes the whole system really snappy and crisp
Android,not_removed,handy
Android,not_removed,and if someone tries mugging you well they just bought a gun to a grenade fight
Android,not_removed,oh yeah i forget about the fast charging ac adapter since i interchange batteries but its really useful when i need a quick charge to get me to one hundred before i purchased my extra batterycharger i used it a lot and if i turned on airplane mode itd get from zero to eighty percent in like twenty minutes tell me more about the status bar i wasnt aware of this want do you mean the status bar
Android,not_removed,the interchangeable battery is a big thing for me one of if not the main reason i bought my
Android,not_removed,yeah i really like the lcd looks amazing at colours
Android,not_removed,same here regularly of sot with relay skype messenger
Android,not_removed,actually in terms of functionality it gives me a crazy small footprint for a phone
Android,not_removed,could be a nexus with a custom rom or kernal
Android,not_removed,willing to bet or htc
Android,not_removed,mi max
Android,not_removed,wave to wake is on my turbo as well im really going to miss being able to wave my hand over the phone to see what time it is first thing in the morning
Android,not_removed,is coming im very excited about it it seems to have the best video and audio recording on a phone and vlogging is what im looking into right now
Android,not_removed,jailbreak doesnt slow down an iphone unless you download loads of different cydia cracksmodsapps its similar to jailbreak in a way it allows you to contro your privacy delete anything on your phone you dont want if you dont want all those samsung apps you can delete them flash custom themed roms all that shit
Android,not_removed,jailbreaking has been known to do that thats why i havent jailbroken since like the iphone rooting can usually do quite the opposite unless you install terrible apps flash a crap rom
Android,not_removed,its another part and point of failure plus a lot of people would never use it
Android,not_removed,only if they stay that way
Android,not_removed,basically، when your device is unlocked touching the status bar without pulling down shows only a part of the shade w useful quick information letting go of it will collapse the shade without pulling up it has been on stock android since ics im not sure of it works on all reskins but im sure it worked on one htc device with sense ui
Android,not_removed,whats funny with this phone is when i got a second battery for it the new one was made weeks before the old battery and somehow equally bad at holding a charge
Android,not_removed,except long battery life
Android,not_removed,pretty much my favourites too ill add huge storage to the list as ive got the version oh and the ir blaster
Android,not_removed,oh no way i wasnt aware ill definitely have to look into it i love my edit please tell me they are keeping the interchangeable battery
Android,not_removed,control your privacy strangely enough cyanogenmod can work without root but still offer privacy protection from apps using its privacy guard as for protecting your privacy from google im not sure root solves that
Android,not_removed,for disabling not deleting preinstalled apps on samsung devices you can get ez disabler on the play store
Android,not_removed,really huh i thought i had noticed an immediate difference in speed but that was several years ago i was immediately sold on android after buying my samsung note three years ago i like the idea of deleting some of the preinstalled apps editfixed time period
Android,not_removed,it does slow down its basically a bunch of apps overwriting memory addresses at boot up
Android,not_removed,lolno its gotten much better since the
Android,not_removed,right that makes sense i however really like the feature even my three year old note has one
Android,not_removed,what do you mean
Android,not_removed,oh cool yeah my does it too i never realised this thats why i made this post to learn about the cool little things like this that make android os coolconvenienthelpful thanks
Android,not_removed,oh man thats lame how much usage do you get out of each of battery
Android,not_removed,yes removable no news on external battery charging kit though
Android,not_removed,you can now hide the default apps on iphone theyre still there but they ultimately dont take up too much space especially with the lowest tier storage being finally
Android,not_removed,literally feels no different after a boot
Android,not_removed,can i get a time machine too lol
Android,not_removed,how do you have a note when it doesnt even exist yet
Android,not_removed,that im not a peopleperson
Android,not_removed,hours sot on this year old of mine when i did pokemongo i also listened to music on bluetooth headphones on those days the battery went down by and usually it loses while on standby
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,wait people hate em
Android,not_removed,jeez thats some seepage man
Android,not_removed,ohh right thanks for clarifying

Android,not_removed,looks like another asian market phone
Android,not_removed,ooh thats pretty htc might be in the running for my next handset rumored to be running a mediatek chip and im out
Android,not_removed,in fairness to htc this is their second device without a jack however it grinds my gears when any oems think they need to copy apple on anything but its infuriating that htc took the bait on this
Android,not_removed,quite likely but if oems keep pulling this crap people will buy these out of necessity or because they see that everyone is doing it then oems use those sales as justification and more oems hop on the bandwagon its a vicious cycle
Android,not_removed,its ridiculously stupid i wont be buying a phone without the jack anytime soon
Android,not_removed,theyre all going to follow this trend the headphone jack is not something most people care about especially if theyre just going to use whatever earphones ship in the box with the phone or the adapter that also ships with the phone and removing it allows the phone to be thinner andor pack a bigger battery larger in the case of the iphone vs the and other features
Android,not_removed,no its not
Android,not_removed,its not what
Android,not_removed,their second phone without a headphone jack
Android,not_removed,yes it is the bolt doesnt have a jack
Android,not_removed,theyve had other phones without it
Android,not_removed,good video surprised they already make usb type c mobile ssds wonder what speeds they get something like that would be super useful for the upcoming nintendo switch
Android,not_removed,ive been on the usb c hype train since it was first announced its panning out slower than i hoped but faster than i expected this video really helps to explain some of the benefits for the new usb but like some other commenters i wish he had talked a little about the different types of power pd vs qc etc
Android,not_removed,should have gotten into usb pd vs qualcomm quick charge
Android,not_removed,i still really like this channel
Android,not_removed,thats assuming the switch supports external storage i think it wont because people could hook up their hdds to the dock and then stuff would get messed up when they disconnect in the middle of a game i think theyre relying on sd cards and hoping they get bigger
Android,not_removed,i fucking love it
Android,not_removed,well the switch supports microsd im sure that nintendo is going to do something with external storage with the dock but i cant really tell you how it will work yet
Android,not_removed,get bigger i have my free micro sd from my note ready
Android,not_removed,fingers crossed whatever they do it will be interesting hopefully the january event really tells everything
Android,not_removed,good point but if the switch is at all competitive with the or xbox one some games could be quite large i could see the need for to a terabyte of storage perhaps the system will have two microsd slots to allow you to more cheaply double your capacity

Android,not_removed,i will be honest here with all the great sms apps like signal and textra that are free the chance of someone buying this app is really really low
Android,not_removed,great app i like the design of the main page the dev extras tab has a changelog which is always nice and the settings tab is well laid out i wont switch from signal because no signal protocol for encrypted messages but apart from that i have nothing but nice things to say id suggest however changing personal address to my phone number or something as i gather thats what the field is supposed to contain based on its placement
Android,not_removed,moto z droid cant get past setup
Android,not_removed,all taken tryed about unmarked
Android,not_removed,looks promising love that youve got the new message bubble style used in android messages have some notes on current functionality not really feature wish list except for changing the sent bubble color it just doesnt work with many other colors would like to change to either a light gray or off white background with white bubble feels a little beta to be a paid app and im a big supporter of paid text apps have bought premium version of textra pulse and evolve the sliding animation is great but makes me think i can swipe to get back to conversation view which would be awesome btw the avatars and bubbles needs to be moved closer to the edge of the screen on my pixel as it is now everything feels jammed into the middle of the screen just looks a little off most times i open conversations its just bubbles with phone numbers in them not the messages and changes to settings dont immediately stick i have to leave conversations or the app entirely for the changes to show i think the features you have decided to focus on are great choices and its exciting to see a text app that seems built around the most current android versions and features instead of one that has been built on an older version with new features added on everything i have mentioned here has been totally in the spirit of constructive criticism this wont be replacing textra for me but ill be keeping it on my phone and messing around with it especially after each update you push looking forward to how this progresses
Android,not_removed,tried to redeem but it says my device is not compatible i looked for a set of requirements for the app but could not find one could you list what the minimum requirements are to run the app i am running a samsung galaxy on
Android,not_removed,tried the app so far i like it but it doesnt seem to want to fetch all my messages some conversations dont have all the messages theyre only to a few weeks ago then stop others dont show up at all any advice i really wanna use this
Android,not_removed,the app is crashing on the sms sync screen i sent the crash report
Android,not_removed,galaxy and cant get by the setting up screen
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,i have tried on my and edge and i cant get past the the setup screen
Android,not_removed,same here all the codes i tried have been taken but werent marked
Android,not_removed,looks like all the codes were taken but some werent marked
Android,not_removed,huawei mate cant set up keeps crashing
Android,not_removed,nexuz here also cant get past setup screen
Android,not_removed,i like the app but have one suggestion could you please add swipe left to delete message threads i use that feature in all other txt messaging apps i use and would really like it here thanks
Android,not_removed,is there any sort of quick reply one like pulse sms would make me switch in a heart beat
Android,not_removed,you might get me to use it if you give the feature to merge conversations like disa does
Android,not_removed,codes all dried up but ill buy it anyway since it looks promising
Android,not_removed,damn all taken i have a few questions nad if you dont mind does this app have a way to send sms through my computer like pulse but their system is not very accurate sometimes do you allow me to send group or long sms as sms and not converting it to mms can i choose a ringtone for my sms i didnt get any codes but im very eager to try it ill probably buy it comment wise it shows promise and you look like you want to improve so keep the good work
Android,not_removed,yes that is certainly a fair point thank you for the feedback
Android,not_removed,thanks you i am glad you think it looks great d and yes i agree my phone number makes a lot more sense thanks d
Android,not_removed,is the app crashing or is it just taking a while thanks
Android,not_removed,i also have a moto z force droid and am also crashing
Android,not_removed,not all of them i just redeemed one
Android,not_removed,thank you for this extensive feedback d i am planning on adding a primary color picker to change this behavior for the app and sent bubbles etc i have been using this app personally for the last few months and its been great some differences between devices seems to be causing issues i an looking into adding swipe to exit into the conversation activities i will move the avatars and bubbles closer to the edge thats a good point thank you for the feedback im excited to see how it progresses as well
Android,not_removed,unfortunately the app requires at this point this is due to a new mms api which is
Android,not_removed,does the app crash when you are setting it up also did you open the app right after sometimes opening the app before it finishes loading will make it stop loading since accessing the database stops the other process i recommend giving it a good while before opening the app please let me know if that helps
Android,not_removed,yeah a lot of people didnt mark them
Android,not_removed,thank you for the report it seems that for some reason one of the messages is missing a field unfortunately the crash wont tell me either i am going to implement a custom crash reporting mechanism to the app so if you dont mind once i release that update if you could try again that would be really helpful sorry about the inconvenience
Android,not_removed,is the app crashing or just taking a while i forgot to change it such that the app will close the screen when finished so you will need to close and reopen the app manually this will be fixed in next update
Android,not_removed,this app uses the newest apis for sms and mms sending meaning that it is as secure as most standard apps like android messages as far as compared to signal i am not entirely sure since i am not too familiar with signal
Android,not_removed,sorry about that samsung devices seem to be missing a database field which is causing crashes i have an idea to solve it but it will take a little bit
Android,not_removed,sorry about that
Android,not_removed,sorry about that
Android,not_removed,sorry about that app seems to have issue with some types of devices i have some crash reports thatll hopefully give me info to fix it
Android,not_removed,agh really worked on my test device im working on fixing all the startup issues
Android,not_removed,i personally dont like the swipe to delete since it can be dodgy so ill probably add an option for it
Android,not_removed,yes it should have quick reply using the lollipop and above system notifications do you have a picture of pulse quick reply so i can see what you mean thanks
Android,not_removed,im sorry what do you mean by merge conversations this could definitely be a possibility
Android,not_removed,thank you i really appreciate it d
Android,not_removed,not currently although there may be some progress with this soon you can make sms always be sent as sms no matter length group messages are always mms yes you can thank you let me know what you think if you get it d
Android,not_removed,completely crashing downloaded the apk you linked above and sent a report
Android,not_removed,i completely understand and plan on upgrading to by the end of the week after that i will check out the app
Android,not_removed,i just set it down and let it do its thing for a bit i have quite a bit of messages so yeah i went ahead and cleared the cache and data for the app and opened it again let it load everything in it seems to work now
Android,not_removed,sure pm or comment to test it
Android,not_removed,takes awhile then it crashed
Android,not_removed,ok sounds good
Android,not_removed,thanks for immediate reply just want to let you know i am rooted and using xposed therefore still on marshmellow if in case not working has anything to do with that
Android,not_removed,sounds good thanks
Android,not_removed,httpiimgurcomqelbztqpng
Android,not_removed,sometimes one person may have or more phone numbers and might message you from any of those you would want all those to appear in a single thread because it is all one conversation eg in the above all conversations are actually from icici bank but using different operators i would like all of them to be under a single conversation
Android,not_removed,i can understand when you say group massage is always mms but i wanted to send an sms to each member of a group of senders i dont know if im making myself clear im super lazy so i love services to send sms on a link from a browser or a program on the computer
Android,not_removed,sorry to hear that can you please try this one
Android,not_removed,awesome glad you hear it one of my favorites things is supporting new apis so as soon as you upgrade to you can be sure that the app has support for all the awesome marshmallow features d
Android,not_removed,awesome i think the solution to this is making it so that my app wont try to get the messages until it has the signal that the app is done loading
Android,not_removed,please download here
Android,not_removed,sorry about the crash please try this version
Android,not_removed,yes my app has this as well does it not show when you receive a message
Android,not_removed,are you saying you want a all recipients to see your message as part of a group or b all recipients to receive an individual sms just from you you can use other services like join or pushbullet i just dont have a native service for this
Android,not_removed,still crashing sent another report
Android,not_removed,most recent update makes it crash on start now sent in a bug report
Android,not_removed,crash sent i hope it can help you
Android,not_removed,no dice still crashes
Android,not_removed,i was just curious before buying as it wasnt in the description nor screenshots
Android,not_removed,pushbullet is a bit meh for me im looking for the one i believe in you hahaha join never used it but ill check it for the all to get individual sms just from me very common in portugal where im from xd
Android,not_removed,alright i am really sorry for the hassle this one should hopefully be it
Android,not_removed,sorry about that can you please try this version and let me know if it helps
Android,not_removed,i found the error fixed in latest update not out yet
Android,not_removed,alright i just realized a way i can get more information with crashes so i will do that and then we can squash this once and for all please report the crash using the notification
Android,not_removed,oh gotcha ill add that as a screenshot thats a good idea
Android,not_removed,yes join is my personal favorite and it has a lot over pushbullet and as far as the single group sms i will add support for that but it will be a little before that happens
Android,not_removed,no worries no hassle here still crashing sent another report
Android,not_removed,always report with notification but still not working
Android,not_removed,good luck
Android,not_removed,fucking loled
Android,not_removed,it is really annoying because the reports arent giving me a lot of information issue with android proguard hiding details
Android,not_removed,it has to do with the media volume
Android,not_removed,stop beating up your poor watch
Android,not_removed,these will never catch on if you have to be so forceful to use them
Android,not_removed,can definitely see this being useful for say a running app that is in ambient mode to check your total distance run you can just tap on the side to get more information without waking up the screen
Android,not_removed,wow awesome job this would be so great if it was implemented in android wear having to swipe through everything can be irritating if only google would put this in aw too bad they never will
Android,not_removed,not could that be really useful but it also looks like heaps of fun what sort of uses have you found for those gestures
Android,not_removed,i imagine a future where these smartwatches can store all my music and play it through my bluetooth headphones that along with tap to play pause and shake wrist to change track would be awesome for jogging
Android,not_removed,doesnt seem practical at all and doesnt it put too much strain on the wrist band
Android,not_removed,i would think that would be bad on the band
Android,not_removed,lmk when its available for other devs to use it
Android,not_removed,the examples they showed were not that useful to me for angry birds it looked way to inaccurate even compared to using the small screen which should work surprisingly well i think and with kinetic scrolling the typical lists on a watch are no problem either but for remote for poweramp i might dig such a feature anyway this could be really useful for changing the screen brightness as well as the phones audio volume quickly
Android,not_removed,android watch and smart watches in general are dead
Android,not_removed,couldnt this be implemented by say double tapping a point on the watch the force required to register the sidetap seems useless in regular use
Android,not_removed,not if your goal is to kill that angry pigs with your angry birds
Android,not_removed,how is this more convenient than swiping your hands are in basically the same place but you have to exert way more effort to do either of these than swipe back and forth on the screen wrists gestures are an actual convenience over swiping because they only require one hand this i dont see what it would be for except maybe some secondary actions in an app ie right clicklong pressforce touch type things
Android,not_removed,there are already wrist gestures so you dont have to swipe
Android,not_removed,you will never know if this post is hot enough to catch their attention they might
Android,not_removed,not a library but maybe some source in android experiment site but not so soon
Android,not_removed,check the last part of the video skipping a long list quick shorcuts and games
Android,not_removed,pokemon go duh
Android,not_removed,well i mean they currently cant store all the music but a few gb at a time seem like it should be enough with a small amount of management if youre ok with that then they already do what you want
Android,not_removed,if you say so mr keyboard genius
Android,not_removed,the strong force here is just to showcase how it works in the video the amount of force required can be fine tuned actually the amount of force can be measured too eg light tap or strong tap
Android,not_removed,do people still play those horrendous games
Android,not_removed,i think this isnt intended to replace any gesture its just another gesture you could add and then have another one adding things to the existing game isnt bad in of the situation
Android,not_removed,good for eyesfree interaction while you are jogging by the way wrist gestures only move item per flick which is very tiring
Android,not_removed,i have gb music but the playlist which i use for workouts is around only fitbit should add the gesture feature to its charge hr
Android,not_removed,this as not at all the case with ux would you use a computer keyboard with alt ctrl meta windows fn command and menu keys where keyboard shortcuts could be any combination of the above adding things to the existing game is bad of the time if youre dealing with anything except a very minimal entrylevel product at least if ux is a priority what you add and how it works needs to be very well thought through
Android,not_removed,how is this better for eyesfree wear is already as simple as swipe up left right or down unless you open an app at which point there are buttons and eyesfree is impossible this is just a less reliable way to go updownleftright given all the other motions that happen when you jog
Android,not_removed,okay i didnt think this but forgot to write it as long as there is a basic and easy way to use a function you can add another maybe faster way for experienced users my prime example for this is the double tap of the multitasking button in android it switches to the app used before your current while normal userswhich dont know the trick will probably just press the multitasking button once and tap the app before
Android,not_removed,suggestions assistant features desktop app duo integration file sharing quick reply sms themes
Android,not_removed,well at least they are listening i think thats something pretty high up on this subs damn it google do list
Android,not_removed,a desktop version with assistant would be quite lovely
Android,not_removed,it doesnt have quick reply yet i mean it is not like i already received a message but that tells a lot
Android,not_removed,well this is already nothing like hangouts there appears to be a development team who are actually awake welcome to the new age
Android,not_removed,how on earth was multidevice not on this list
Android,not_removed,one weird thing allo doesnt support split screen right now
Android,not_removed,i just want the ability to search for and send gifs
Android,not_removed,suggestions assistant features desktop app duo integration file sharing quick reply sms themes thats all i can say 🤐 sms thats all i can say 😯 sms 😯
Android,not_removed,id need to use it in a browser at home i cant be bothered to message on my phone when i have several keyboards attached to computers also this is more for my technologically illiterate friends wouldnt it be nice if it had trillianesq support for whatsapp although id be happy to switch to something else my friends probably wont
Android,not_removed,glad they acknowledged sms hope it actually makes it into the app
Android,not_removed,didnt every android user suggest these months ago fml
Android,not_removed,what does it meaannn
Android,not_removed,how about cross device chats i have to carry phones would be nice to continue my conversation across either device ya know like basically every other messaging app out there
Android,not_removed,reallystill no android wear support
Android,not_removed,sms plus desktop i am
Android,not_removed,multiple devices plzzz
Android,not_removed,if they did all those things id be all over the app themes and sms being the most crucial though particularly if sms and im messages could be seamless like imessage
Android,not_removed,i might be in the minority but im really enjoying allo its cleaneasy to useand my android family uses it well group messages over sms between me my wife and my mom were always hell because my work is a cell dead zone but i do get wifi i know theres always been whatsappkakaoetc but never had the urge to use them to alleviate the problem
Android,not_removed,desktop clientweb app would be absolutely the first priority imo i know sms is high on the list here but honestly you dont need that to succeed
Android,not_removed,google please im begging you give us the smsrcs support if my friends dont want to use the app let me still get messages through it and respond like that
Android,not_removed,just give us a telegram clone with better encryption and assistant
Android,not_removed,this guy has a smug looking face like martin shkreli
Android,not_removed,well put those things in and ill use it right away hopefully this means they are working on those
Android,not_removed,he is either indicating that these features will be here very soon or he is incredibly out of touch with googles fan base
Android,not_removed,desktoooooop
Android,not_removed,not to forget split screen and chat backupsync as long as i wont potentially lose chat logs permanently if i change devices then ill start trying to use it with people
Android,not_removed,does anyone know a good way to get friends to get allo ive tried telling my friends about it but nobody is willing
Android,not_removed,suggestion integrate new features into google hangouts no need for a new gimped messaging platform just make hangouts better instead of abandoning and starting over
Android,not_removed,kinda a bummer that i cant send someone an allo message using ok google command because allo isnt a default messaging app i know its been said a million times but what the actual fuck were they thinking
Android,not_removed,hangout integration
Android,not_removed,i want gifs dammit
Android,not_removed,up next justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just eaten a cheesecake justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just brushed his teeth justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just climbed into bed justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just kissed his wife good night and rolled over justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just woken up justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just eaten a bowl of crunchberries® oops all berries® for breakfast justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just brushed his teeth justin uberti colead of allo tweets he has just gotten into his car
Android,not_removed,you know what shocked me today turning my phone sideways and discovering allo didnt even have landscape mode he didnt have to make a list he just had to put requests things every messaging app should launch with
Android,not_removed,he doesnt even acknowledge that this is something they are going to work at there are no deadlines or upcoming patch announcements and its not as if there were some sensational features on that list we are mostly talking about shit that far more popular messengers already got i just hope they dont wait until the next year to announce their next messenger app i miss the hype
Android,not_removed,i really want them to add a quick find to the assistant tab honestly i think that right next to the hamburger menu where it says allo turn that into a button when you click it it launches assitant right next to it could be duo and clicking it launches duo
Android,not_removed,i have no idea why they didnt just wait until these were implemented
Android,not_removed,what about end too ended encryption i see that as a common complaint and why uninstalled it
Android,not_removed,wait there is no quick reply
Android,not_removed,if it has the ability to be a default messenger on my android phone and interact with any other phones messenger imessage or whatever android messenger then there is no reason it wont be widely used
Android,not_removed,to be released in too bad allo will be killed off long before we get there
Android,not_removed,honest question what about that stuff mentioned by snowden about being insecure is that still there
Android,not_removed,i hope they get those done soon
Android,not_removed,id like to add support google apps suite customer support but i know that wont happen for a couple of years
Android,not_removed,sms
Android,not_removed,itt sms desktop client duo integration video chat quick reply themes so hangouts you want quick reply and themes for hangouts
Android,not_removed,thats all i can say like its changes that are coming its only suggestions from other people
Android,not_removed,i asked google assistant to remind me when my favourite shows are about to come on couldnt do it
Android,not_removed,this is awesome thanks for listening
Android,not_removed,all i want are rich links
Android,not_removed,if you read the first letter of each it says add fqst now we just have to figure out what fqst is
Android,not_removed,can someone just tell me why they dont integrate allo hangouts and messenger all into one app thatd be dope as hell
Android,not_removed,please make allo work on google home i want to be able to use a google home with a couple of buddies to schedule a trip i want it so we can bring in search things such that all can see it on our tvs from our google home casting to the tv also want to arrange calendars for the trip with allo using google home
Android,not_removed,if they listen to every suggestion it will stand a chance
Android,not_removed,this must be the most clueless team on earth and i believe someone at google claimed it sent a crack team for months to india to study how to beat whatsapp half these suggestions are so painfully obvious i would die of shame if on this team
Android,not_removed,dont forget calling
Android,not_removed,they are really listening some of the stuff we have been asking are stuff we been begging for years we want an imessage solution for android this has been going on for years when they did that half ass integration with hangout it sucked and lets not talk about the desktop client we wanted to be able to answer our sms on the desktop hangout only loaded hangout message and nothing more we had to resort to party like pushbullet to be able to answer our message through the pc if they really wanted to do it they would have done it years ago you are late to the game and you are going to come to a gun fight with your arms tied and your excuse is that this is a
Android,not_removed,did the team actually spend week one starting to work on some of those suggestions or did week one just get spent putting together a list of requested features most of which shouldve been there at launch
Android,not_removed,what will happen when allo slowly morphs into hangouts until they become indistinguishable
Android,not_removed,they probably going to half ass it like hangout
Android,not_removed,no smsmms no care crew signing in edit flame suit activated
Android,not_removed,option to download users would be nice
Android,not_removed,he looks old for an intern not that im being ageist because it has to be interns working on all these different messaging apps at googleright
Android,not_removed,😐
Android,not_removed,i dont know how sms and desktop app wasnt part of their initial plan but now included as a suggestion
Android,not_removed,what does assistant features even mean
Android,not_removed,just bring the assistant to hangouts and make hangouts use the quic protocol boom of immediate requests satisfied
Android,not_removed,sounds like a list of things that should have been enabled at golive to me
Android,not_removed,why is sms even a suggestion make it the default sms app on android sync it across all devices then publish it to the apple store and bam
Android,not_removed,duo integreation literally almost no code required just add a button to both apps and so on for specific people sms again could have been there to start desktop app by far the easiest morons
Android,not_removed,right there might actually be a team working on it full time thats a pretty good step
Android,not_removed,its nice to have communication for a change but they have to know what the app needs to make it great they have plenty of examples on the play store including hangouts its just a matter of getting it done
Android,not_removed,i await the day i can activate it by calling it zhu li and knows me well enough to know what i want when i say do the thing
Android,not_removed,its encouraging i wouldve done all this before releasing it but ill take it
Android,not_removed,id switch immediately proper sms would be nice and i really hope they look at it in the future but being able to reply on my computer is whats keeping me on hangouts it seems like such an odd feature not to have at launch hopefully its a priority
Android,not_removed,id prefer a web client over a desktop client
Android,not_removed,not sure how that can be accomplished if its tied to a phone number doesnt keep a backup so that if you uninstall the app your messages wont come back after you reinstall
Android,not_removed,ha google making a desktop client for anything good one
Android,not_removed,yeah it doesnt have a reply button but it does give you two intelligent replies to choose from as buttons on the notification
Android,not_removed,missing quick reply is a special bummer in the context of missing a web app if it had quick reply third party solutions like pushbullet could at least respond to sent messages
Android,not_removed,funny thing is i believe he was a lead of hangouts as well or still is
Android,not_removed,well see about that
Android,not_removed,one employee tweets something and suddenly randroid knows theres a dedicated team of hyperaware devs just waiting to implement the exact features they want
Android,not_removed,i think thats sorta implied with desktop client because work to have the user account not be tied to a single client would be a prerequisite
Android,not_removed,its twitter you cant fit a huge list in a tweet not to mention he said it was a brief list in addition to saying cant say more🤐
Android,not_removed,multidevice wouldnt really work in the way something like hangouts would because the messages arent stored on googles servers or in the cloud
Android,not_removed,just make sure you force activities to be resizeable in developer settings
Android,not_removed,id settle for links to gifs embedding the gif inline i know both facebook messenger and telegram do that already
Android,not_removed,just to be clear this is a list of common suggestions that i received in alpha order condensed to fit in a single tweet
Android,not_removed,best thing ive ever seen 😂
Android,not_removed,could in theory be possible as whatsapp has apis for desktop support wouldnt be bad forgot about trillian
Android,not_removed,im hopeful that on the theyll announce rcs and update allo to be the rcs client with sms fallback notice i said hopeful though im not going into the expecting this but instead wishing upon a star
Android,not_removed,features may or may not be coming soon®
Android,not_removed,it means that people suggested these things to him and he cant currently comment on anything theyre doing with the app pretty straightforward really
Android,not_removed,double rainbow
Android,not_removed,whatsapp doesnt but im with you it was one of the things that i asked for
Android,not_removed,thats a cool flair itd be a shame if someone stole it
Android,not_removed,i think this is one of the weaknesses of only associating your account with a phone number which makes no sense in the current landscape
Android,not_removed,that cant happen just like you cant with whatsapp the whole point of this app is to be an rcs client cant have multiple numbers tied to it just like you cant with sms
Android,not_removed,most of that programming will be already done once they add the web client just the api being able to login to the account without the phone number and handling multiple connected clients
Android,not_removed,wouldnt direct reply do the same thing or are you saying wear support like hangouts i also dont think wear support was requested like the other onesits just not that popular
Android,not_removed,there isnt an app that you can open but notifications will let you use suggested replies im assuming when they add quick replies to the main app it will update android wear as well
Android,not_removed,the suggestions listed are paramount to the usability of allo wear support is an extra that will be automatically implemented when it gets sms integration
Android,not_removed,wifi calling its life changing and worth an early upgrade
Android,not_removed,in america you do and yes theres more to the world than america but google is an american company and america was clearly one of the few main targets based on localization of the assistant
Android,not_removed,this
Android,not_removed,it looks cleanworks seamlessly has stickers and gifs handle group chats amazing runs on lots of devices i love using the web app i can get a new phone and all my messages show up on the next device to me its the imessage to my android phone just does not have sms integration
Android,not_removed,can you give some more detail on this assistant wont work in chats if it was encrypted like incognito chats
Android,not_removed,annoying meme
Android,not_removed,send them the commercial video on youtube maybe its tough cause even if you did get them to download it be prepared to every question right now with it does not do thatright now
Android,not_removed,that would make too much sense though
Android,not_removed,ew he doesnt shower
Android,not_removed,oh yeah like bbm whatsapp and any other instant messaging app that lacks sms i really want them to add sms support to allo to boost adoption and i dont think sms is something every messaging app should launch with
Android,not_removed,landscape mode is kinda pointless in messaging apps though with exception for media viewing
Android,not_removed,i remember a tweet correctly the colead said something about an update after a few weeks or something like that ill see if i can find it somewhere edit added photo to show that will update after a few weeks maybe
Android,not_removed,i bet well see a big update for oct technically they didnt even announce it i can see them announce both allo and duo like apple announces new apps and when they announce it i expect it to have all these things lets wait for the
Android,not_removed,because people were getting really impatient
Android,not_removed,it already has endtoend encryption with incognito chats
Android,not_removed,he said alphabetical order
Android,not_removed,nah thatll happen just after its all done i reckon
Android,not_removed,incognito mode has end to end encryption and will keep data safe the default chats dont other apps like facebook messenger and telegram do this the same way snowden probably just decided to attack allo because it was new its just as secure as any of the apps that dont have end to end as default
Android,not_removed,hangouts has a lot of bugs for me i hate using it i love what it is but it needs done better also the assistantappearancestickersdrawing on pictures is a big reason
Android,not_removed,i think so toobut apparently justin ubertigoogleet al believe that unbundling is the future which i think is a mistake
Android,not_removed,i dont want one big bloated app i like xmpp because it was server side so the app is lightweight
Android,not_removed,more likely to be a part of duo
Android,not_removed,well actually his argument to that is much simpler why has noone except apple created an imessage system its pretty easy to understand what that means and its what a lot of us have suspected for years
Android,not_removed,that type of redundancy would be a pretty big waste of their time and resources so thats probably what theyre planning to do
Android,not_removed,hangouts will be for businessthats not going to change they will probably drop some stuff like stickers and add some stuff file sharing that will appeal to businesses allo will live on for the typical consumer gifs videos audio messages file sending stickers emoji ect imo they will never be indistinguishable once allo gets the major things hangouts has desktop duo integration with group calls sms people will eventually move overespecially if google forces them to
Android,not_removed,you mean they havent already half assed allo with its release
Android,not_removed,yeah i would like to download my mom
Android,not_removed,je ne sais pas francais
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,my guess is they needed a larger scale testing of allo so they released an early but working build of it they havent really advertised allo that much its gone public without any sort of fanfare aside from a little youtube video even though india seems like a main target they seem to be more of an appropriate testbed than anything else that makes sense if you look at allos features as well no sms is irrelevant in india a desktop client isnt that big of a deal there ditto multi device support my guess is the real release happens in three days or at pixel launch and itll be a much more featurespecced app very soon really should be on the that means theyll reach a massive audience and be able to actually get allo onto devices so people can start using it
Android,not_removed,im assume for it to do more things right now it defaults to searching the web instead of doing things
Android,not_removed,hahahaha as if two google projects would interoperate funny joke
Android,not_removed,make hangouts use the quic protocol thats like saying write a completely new app and call it hangouts
Android,not_removed,is sms is available to developers on ios
Android,not_removed,leave apple out of it that makes what were asking for with sms a lot more doable let it work just like imessage for android and ill be happy
Android,not_removed,before you make it the default sms app you have to actually make it work i wouldnt consider this app capable of sms in its current state
Android,not_removed,if i recall correctly it was posted here that the allo team is hiring developers
Android,not_removed,better than the high school students in the basement working on hangouts
Android,not_removed,might
Android,not_removed,yes if they didnt have a backlog of features to eventually get implemented that they thought would make allo better than hangouts and every other messenger out there they wouldnt have started
Android,not_removed,holy crap if this was a thing i could invent so many things im convinced this is the only thing holding me back
Android,not_removed,then you may have released it in
Android,not_removed,exactly currently the sms support they have now doesnt even work in canada so im forced to use apps if theyd have proper support or even something like hangouts dialer where it takes your phone number for the caller id id be good with
Android,not_removed,i mean do you have a decent amount of people that use allo to where sms isnt a must for you i have no friends on it
Android,not_removed,it has sms support but it comes from a different number people asking for proper sms are just looking for it to come from their own number
Android,not_removed,those basically mean the same thing for googles stuff like the hangouts application on osxwinlinuxchromeos its just a snazzy webapp that runs in a chromeless window and doesnt need a full instance of the browser open i mean there is the hangoutsgooglecom site too of course
Android,not_removed,if they made a uwp app id do a backflip though
Android,not_removed,i would prefer desktop and web client
Android,not_removed,i kinda wish google would start making programs again like google talk and less stuff in the browser nonweb applications have so much more flexibility and potential
Android,not_removed,a chrome app would be nice
Android,not_removed,web apps can run on desktops these days
Android,not_removed,most of the time smart replies works better but there are times where i need to open the app i wonder if its an os restriction to be able to have both options hopefully fixes that
Android,not_removed,i have never found the smart replies to be relevant my girlfriend can tell me i had a terrible day at work and it suggests or sent
Android,not_removed,well for me it seems that smart replies are better than custom text quick replies if you really want to type something most of the times its better to open the app but the app opening slowly is another issue
Android,not_removed,in that case i wonder if one day well find out the truth was something like the hangouts team had their hands tied by xyz
Android,not_removed,anybody can post a tweet exactly anybody can hear feedback after years with google you know only to believe something after you get it
Android,not_removed,not necessarily whatsapp is single device but has a web interface i think pretty much everyone would rather have true multiclient than their version maybe not the very privacy concerned people
Android,not_removed,exactly
Android,not_removed,what reddit app is that
Android,not_removed,just did that but allo still blocks it
Android,not_removed,verizon messages has gif sending from app
Android,not_removed,yes i too read that edit downvoted why the guy literally replied with a quote from the tweet with suggestions italicized implying that i didnt realize that when making my dank meme even though thats the first word i quoted in my comment and the basis of it okay
Android,not_removed,whatsapp is such ugly software and i truthfully cant stand it now that facebook owns it i want to distance myself from it as much as i can
Android,not_removed,yes that would be ideal
Android,not_removed,baby
Android,not_removed,all the way
Android,not_removed,which is a really good reason to make it happen
Android,not_removed,but hangouts doessame with facebook messenger
Android,not_removed,lol have at it
Android,not_removed,telegram allows multiple devices to be registered on the same account that uses a single phone number
Android,not_removed,no its not messenger will probably be the rcs client
Android,not_removed,yeabe able to respond via watch
Android,not_removed,i already get that through my tmob plan and who actually uses the phone to talk anyways
Android,not_removed,i agree but keep in mind a lot of things google does isnt just for america if they wanted to succeed with the nexus phones they shouldve just embedded all phones in with carriers and offer subsidies since day instead they went with the unlocked model which completely flounders in the us and yet they sold the nexus phone in only a few handful of countries it wasnt til the they started releasing in more countries but theres still a lack of penetration given that they arent very well distributed asia is also completely left out in googles unlocked model sales furthermore you can still do well without having sms just look at hangouts even though it lacked sms and utterly sucked in many other features it still had a userbase that had its roots in chatting in gmail just imagine if hangouts was a well built app that only lacked sms
Android,not_removed,are you implying god uberti gets unclean
Android,not_removed,i dont want sms in it dont be an isheep and fall for imessage propaganda
Android,not_removed,i write in landscape mode and if there werent apps that force landscape i would just have unistalled allo
Android,not_removed,google assistant doesnt work with incognito so the only feature worth using is useless when you want privacy
Android,not_removed,its just as secure as any of the apps that dont have end to end as default if not even more so allo uses encryption to and from googles servers
Android,not_removed,really i dont find any of the additional features very useful however i know my tastes arent always in line with what others want really the point of what i was attempting to say probably too sharply in retrospect is that google already has a platform for these functions it seems odd that instead of improving an existing platform they elected to create a new one from scratch especially considering that from this post its safe to assume they actuality do plan on reimplementing the core functionality hangouts was buggy because it was incomplete why not just complete it
Android,not_removed,bundle those together and make it run smooth and available on ios and then you have an imessage killer
Android,not_removed,as long as it runs smoothly i really dont care if its a or it just has to compete with imessage and give us android users a decent experience
Android,not_removed,it already is you can video chat without your camera being on
Android,not_removed,id also like to download your mom
Android,not_removed,me too
Android,not_removed,and a lot of assistant features only work in the assistant chat cant ask it to tell a joke if youre in a chat with one or more people for instance
Android,not_removed,i guess that would mean merging google now and assistant
Android,not_removed,yeah its probably a catch all for every single thing suggested for it
Android,not_removed,theyve changed the protocol and codecs multiple times over the past couple of years besides changing protocol and codecs doesnt require a complete rewrite of the app only a particular layer of it in theory the app is supposed to a lot more than that but in hangouts case thats also questionable
Android,not_removed,no
Android,not_removed,lol true forgot the garden is walled
Android,not_removed,a google developer tweeted it he had a really cool name
Android,not_removed,they hired more
Android,not_removed,its likely they have a list of features they want to get through its also likely that the requested features are on this list where the community feedback and suggestions come into play is that it helps them prioritize which features to work on first this doesnt mean that these are going to be worked on immediately or shipped first it just helps the internal team working on allo prioritize as much as they can
Android,not_removed,no tbh i know like people who use allo i could probably convince another or to switch from hangouts though thats a guess i mean more that i could live with two apps for messaging allo and an sms client even though integration would be great but losing a desktop ui for my messaging client would be too much of a step down for me to consider leaving hangouts in favour of allo
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,i think people want to be able to set it as the default sms app as well
Android,not_removed,and also i dont want it to bug people to get the app if it sends it through sms
Android,not_removed,seeing a random robot number texting you to invite you to download an app is just off putting preferably it would see if the person you are messaging has allo and is online before sending an allo message and just send an sms from your number otherwise it doesnt seem like a crazy feature for a team of professional engineers to implement there are teenagers making sms apps
Android,not_removed,my friends got so confused either google voice where it would mess up and send from the fake number and not the real one
Android,not_removed,if you initiate the conversation with allo then sms is transparent however if someone else initiates the conversation using sms then it goes to your sms client and not allo ninja edit missing word
Android,not_removed,it shuts out all nonchrome users which is frustrating thankfully hangouts is available in gmailinbox something similar for allo would be nice
Android,not_removed,google uwp app lol
Android,not_removed,sorry whats uwp
Android,not_removed,this makes no sense how are non web applications more flexible and have more potential its quite the opposite web applications are easier to maintain and you dont have to have a specific development teams for specific plattforms you get the same experience across the board and you can go about your business no matter where you are without having to download or installing anything
Android,not_removed,web app is better available to more than just chrome
Android,not_removed,itll be an extension just like the hangouts one is as they are phasing out actual chrome apps on windowsmacoslinux
Android,not_removed,chrome apps are on the way out though right
Android,not_removed,i dont think its an os restriction cause fb messenger has both a like button that sends the thumbs up automatically and a reply button that opens up quick reply
Android,not_removed,i doubt its an os restriction when it took them forever to add quick reply to hangouts
Android,not_removed,ive noticed it starting to get better for me over time id still prefer one smart reply and then the quick reply option i am pretty sure notifications can only have two actions
Android,not_removed,it would have been justifiable if they didnt make quick reply in notifications a key highlighted feature of nougat
Android,not_removed,quick reply without leaving an app is nice its not super often that it matters but if im in something like my banking app itll log me out if i switch to another app its also just slightly quicker than having to switch back when youre done though double tap on the multitask button will help with this
Android,not_removed,theres absolutely no reason you cant have two smart reply options and then just a reply option that allows you to quick reply as normal
Android,not_removed,but the app opening slowly is another issue allo flies for me much faster than hangouts didnt realize this was an issue for people
Android,not_removed,its possible the hangouts team had their hands tied by being part of g suite enterprise customers generally favor a tool that works predictably over cool new features i suspect thats the same reason the gmail team created inbox instead of just adding features to gmail itself gmail and hangouts for business users inbox and allo for consumers
Android,not_removed,anybody can but few or even next to many doesnt thats the difference here
Android,not_removed,talk is hangouts
Android,not_removed,actually talk worked pretty well except for creating a group chat on the web caused the talk client on the phone to crash constantly
Android,not_removed,whatsapp doesnt count at all still requires phone to be used
Android,not_removed,true and i think the way they designed the app from the ground up may actually make true multidevice support difficult
Android,not_removed,i dont see how this would work given the architecture hangouts can do this as its tied to your google account allo is tied to your number
Android,not_removed,either or i want to be able to be on my computer and be able to send messages
Android,not_removed,slide for reddit
Android,not_removed,slide the best reddit app rslideforreddit
Android,not_removed,i think you have to reboot to get it to work
Android,not_removed,hmm what phone what build number i get the things may not work correctly message but everything seems fine to me
Android,not_removed,downvoted why because of this edit downvoted why the guy literally replied with a quote from the tweet with suggestions italicized implying that i didnt realize that when making my dank meme even though thats the first word i quoted in my comment and the basis of it okay
Android,not_removed,really i switched from hangouts to whatsapp and immediately was impressed by the ui in comparison hangouts felt unpolished and ugly whatsapp feels slick and modern i know hangouts isnt the most popular around here but still
Android,not_removed,yeah i agree and do not use it it is very clunky and i just do not like it do wish allo would have been a more feature rich app at launch guess well see as time goes on however i do have friends with iphones that actually prefer duo to facetime so theres that
Android,not_removed,and i agree but the like every other messaging app is incorrect
Android,not_removed,and telegram and imessage and im pretty sure line and wechat too not supporting multiple devices is the minority
Android,not_removed,i think just adding quick reply would do this then but that doesnt bring starting conversations from the app on the watch
Android,not_removed,i love that i can use the smart replies from wear though at least
Android,not_removed,you mentioned group messaging being hell because you have no reception but do have wifi wifi calling lets you do smsetc over wifi hence my comment if you do have wifi calling already then i really dont know why you have issues with texting
Android,not_removed,an isheep nearly every phone ive owned has run on android and i intend to stick with android wanting sms support to boost adoption of allo doesnt make me an apple fanboy
Android,not_removed,well yeah assistant cant read your messages if you encrypt them if you want endtoend encryption then you cant have any features that involve messages being read by the server if you want features that require messages being readable by a server then you cant have endtoend encryption there isnt anything allo could do better in that regard it has a cool feature that requires your messages to be readable by a server but it still gives you the option to pass on that feature and encrypt your messages instead
Android,not_removed,thats transport layer security which pretty much any major messaging app has right now
Android,not_removed,i feel you on all of that but i also think it had a bad rep already im not a genius with marketing but im not sure how to recover from that also i know a lot of people disagree completely but im a big fan of just starting fresh with some things that way you can really plan it out and do everything right allo is done extremely well for what it is right now its missing a lot of key features but what it does do it does perfect and i think thats awesome im somewhat positive theyll add features to at least keep up with whatsapp and others file sharing gif support quick reply other things i cant think of and if it does then its still an excellent alternative i personally love using it but without other major features such as sms and desktop client even multidevice though i have no use for that right now it just makes it an extra app for me
Android,not_removed,well yes but id expect an official update to support it too
Android,not_removed,can i upload her idk if she will fit threw the cable wire might need to achieve it
Android,not_removed,yes you can just type google tell me a joke you can access mostany of the assistant features in regular chat be preceding the request with google
Android,not_removed,you cant set reminders which is super dumb
Android,not_removed,i thought that was the plan all along the okgooglesiri baby complete with helpful flash cards they are at least going to make google assistant work with the google home thing right
Android,not_removed,well all of them are in high school so they can only work like hour weeks so essentially one person
Android,not_removed,they just need to add the assistant to hangouts and boom of immediate requests are done then start making hangouts robust and sleeker
Android,not_removed,isnt the app useless if no one you know users it honest question
Android,not_removed,but then the google assistant doesnt work in all chats
Android,not_removed,its far from transparent the other person gets a robot number and doesnt know who it is at first i pity someone who has a couple different people trying to message them with allo and they dont have it
Android,not_removed,hangoutsgooglecom works for nonchrome users i agree though hate the chrome app in a tab is fine
Android,not_removed,i know right i wont be doing any backflips any time soon
Android,not_removed,universal windows platform the new windows apps that use microsofts new api edit people are being pedantic so i changed to i thought a quick answer would be sufficient if you do research you will learn about the history of the windows runtime which became uwp with windows
Android,not_removed,more access to the hardware can do far more custom tricks than anything you can do reasonably in javascript
Android,not_removed,yep and works just fine whatsapp web app makes notification sounds and pops up a native desktop notification and the tab changes to a number when i have unread messages dont know what more i could really need oh and works in both firefox and chrome which is nice since i use both and switch a lot
Android,not_removed,thats not true
Android,not_removed,they were one of the first apps to support nougats quick reply though
Android,not_removed,hangouts did not work predictably even remotely hell they removed the presence mode and switched to besteffortdelivery when it was first launched no business would accept it
Android,not_removed,sureanything is better than nothing but im saying the difference between no words and words is very small compared to the difference of no action and action
Android,not_removed,we are all hangouts on this blessed day
Android,not_removed,its still a desktop client even if not a standalone one and since its the market leader in the im space i think its pretty fair to include them in the conversation
Android,not_removed,not really for example imagine they did this you want to sign in on a device you type your phone number in google sends a message to your primary device that allo is signed in on asking if you want to authenticate the account you say yes the devices use the nearby api to communicate so that the secondary device receives the secure token to sign in to the account at which point the second device registers with fcm to receive push notifications for allo job done
Android,not_removed,just give users the option of making an allo account which can be tied to their google or can simply be their phone number a password which they can then use to login on other devices and continue to use the service there really no reason it cant be done heck you could even go the whatsapp way of making them scan a qr code on the primary device the first time and then theyre logged in on that device from there hopefully without the constantly needing to be in touch with the phone restriction whatsapp has
Android,not_removed,allo isnt tied to your number your number is just a login a unique identifier trust me when i say there is absolutely no technical reason why you couldnt open the app on a tablet and login with a phone number with an sms verification code sent to another device none whatsoever the only caveat is the encryption chats those decryption keys should only be on one device
Android,not_removed,does it allow comments to be sorted by new by default
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,you think i would have tried that first but i didnt works fine now thanks im just not used to needing to reboot this phone for anything because it runs so well
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,i love you guys
Android,not_removed,to be honest whatsapp feels like im using windows i think the only ui that i like in a messaging app is textra and it only handles sms
Android,not_removed,telegram is registered by phone number and is able to accomplish this
Android,not_removed,thats just because it mirrors the notification actions ideally it would do that have the ability to speak a reply and maybe scroll down for more smart replies
Android,not_removed,not sure about that just because you have wifi calling doesnt meant you get wifi sms do you ive never gotten sms over wifi and theres no setting on the phone for it
Android,not_removed,my opinion is that sms is a garbage technology that is unnecessary all other im is strictly better i mean you cant sms on wifi and you always have a data connection if you have a signal which means the coverage for im is just better than sms especially when travelling the odds of being able to connect to a free wifi is pretty low or inside buildings where data signal is not available there is most likely a wifi more and more services like google station and eduroam are popping up i use sms for nothing i only get ads and authentication texts as sms i want all that stuff in a separate app where i wont see it if for some reason i have a contact which i use sms for its a good way of filtering out those contacts with a separate app the main reason i use im is because of desktop support history and multiple devices allo doesnt have any of that and thats why allo is also currently garbage
Android,not_removed,yeah i figured most major apps would have that but wasnt certain
Android,not_removed,just tried it again and the joke does work i was having trouble at launch for whatever reason there are still apparently some that dont work in normal chat if i were to say google tell us a joke every day then it says it cant yet just as an example
Android,not_removed,i wish the nicer games would work in regular chat
Android,not_removed,it isnt able to access my calendar or anything except in assistant chat
Android,not_removed,well when you ask assistant what google home is it says that it is a voice activated device powered by google assistant and then in a second message it says thats me so yeah id say the answer to that is yes
Android,not_removed,yes google assistant is in home
Android,not_removed,just dont google that
Android,not_removed,tbh as long as the core group i message most of the time have it its no worse than hangouts for personally
Android,not_removed,its also about people being able to send to your number and still have it interact with allo the current system only works when theyre replying to you
Android,not_removed,giving allo the context of online is probably the easiest thing to implement out of everything i said if it is not already there anyway it kind of needs to know if someone is online or their servers would be sending messages to a users old ip address and assume theyve been sent properly sms might be old but it works what kind of control would google need that would prevent the from using it tcpip is old should google stop using the internet attempting to force people to only use internetbased messaging when sms works with nearly no issues at all is simply trying to find a solution for a problem that doesnt exist if the kind of control that you are talking about is just that google wants to know what you are sending through sms they can already do that by just reading what youve sent and received from your phone im not saying google should force users to use allo for texting but it should be an option a lot of android users have wanted a seamless smsinternetbased messenger for a long time and google is the most qualified to make this product hangouts did not provide this hangouts made the user make sure they are sending messages through sms if the other person was not online it was inconvenient and too much of a hassle for a majority of users apple has implemented this seamlessness perfectly and all the features needed are already in place in android we are just waiting for someone to make it and of course google can do whatever the fuck they want no one is saying they have to make this it is just extremely disappointing for a lot of people that it wasnt made a long time ago
Android,not_removed,well no thats why it would check if the person you are messaging has allo and it would take advantage of the allo features if they do
Android,not_removed,id be fine without google assistant if i had proper sms something like imessage you can use imessage features if youre texting someone with imessage or use standard sms if they dont
Android,not_removed,until you try to do video calling in edge
Android,not_removed,a net core app wouldnt be that far fetched for google though maybe jon skeet will write it
Android,not_removed,cheers
Android,not_removed,windows uwp is not
Android,not_removed,windows and were pushing winrt uwp was introduced with windows
Android,not_removed,i am not experienced enough to say is entirely true or false but i would lean towards false since pretty much everything is shifting towards the web either way were talking about a web chat application if the program itself would need that kind of resources youre doing it wrong
Android,not_removed,on august google announced that it would begin phasing out chrome apps for windows mac and linux by the end of finishing the process in early the company said that the applications will continue to be supported and maintained onchrome os for the foreseeable future
Android,not_removed,nougat quick reply just leverages the android wear reply functionality in nougat though apps are supposed to leave notifications that you reply to in the notification shade and append your reply into the notification you can see this if you quick reply to a messenger notification hangouts doesnt do that surprise surprise
Android,not_removed,speak for yourself
Android,not_removed,i understand your point but its literally no different from their already useless web client im just venting sorry p
Android,not_removed,in all of my circles in the uk dj messenger is streets ahead of anyone else and they have proper multi client
Android,not_removed,maybe the easiest would be to integrate ones google account into allo but i suspect its not so simple on the backend especially considering your number is owned by your carrier and not google
Android,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvcnxouypng
Android,not_removed,reddit is fun does this
Android,not_removed,i missed an r check my edited comment
Android,not_removed,no worries i just rebooted my phone a few minutes ago because i couldnt remember the last time i did this nexus has been such an amazing phone i dont have any real interest in the pixels i hope huawei gets the next round
Android,not_removed,hmm weird what about allo version here
Android,not_removed,admittedly i am not on tmobile but wifi calling on att definitely allows sendingreceiving texts i have zero cell reception within my home except a two foot box near my front door and wifi calling has been life changing i agree who makes actual phone calls and in fact looking at tmobiles website it says it supports smsmms so it certainly should work just like atts
Android,not_removed,the benefit of sms is its ubiquity you can count on everyone from your grandma to your best friend to have sms capability on their phone its even more important in parts of the world where sms is still popular like canada and the us no one is arguing that sms is better than instant messaging also dont be selfish just because you dont use sms doesnt mean google shouldnt add sms support to allo it would benefit others and help allos user base grow
Android,not_removed,i mean you cant sms on wifi and you always have a data connection if you have a signal not true ive had plenty of times when i could send texts but had no data connection either in isolated areas or when the cell is really full festivals etc
Android,not_removed,anything that reveals personal information ie show me my agenda show my latest email dont work in group chats and as you noticed recurring things dont work i assume the recurring stuff doesnt work because it doesnt know which user to attach it too should just be the one that requested it or maybe because it isnt yet designed to record which chat to put it in
Android,not_removed,i think it wont display personal information in public chat
Android,not_removed,seriously id rather be able to use allo to text someone who doesnt have allo while not being able to use assistant than not be able to text them with allo at all
Android,not_removed,the point of allo is for the assistant to be available in all conversations
Android,not_removed,to be fair even microsoft sites tell you to use ie and not edge
Android,not_removed,lol
Android,not_removed,youre correct but i thought it would be simpler to leave that out since uwp was designed as an extension to the windows runtime first introduced in server and windows the apps are basically the same in practice
Android,not_removed,see my reply to the other guy i just simplified my answer a bit windows runtime apps just need small modifications to become uwp apps theyre not very different
Android,not_removed,ok how about i like my chat windows to be free floating and not tied to a tab i can accidentally close or required to run out of a bloated browser the hangouts plugin was also pretty gross in windows awful in linux but gajim runs amazingly smooth and fits with the oss theme
Android,not_removed,i know but they still pushed an update for it
Android,not_removed,and with hangouts sometimes it doesnt send just spins and spins and i have to open the app to reply and type the same thing
Android,not_removed,i am all hangouts on this blessed day
Android,not_removed,your google account is linked to allo already though
Android,not_removed,im sold i dont understand why the official app doesnt allow this a real pita
Android,not_removed,will give it a try aswell thanks
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,yeah im in the same camp no reason to upgrade because this phone is amazing front facing speakers and amoled are things i had no idea that i wanted but now would never want to give them up i dont even mind the mediocre battery because it charges so fast for productivity the giant screen is a huge advantage
Android,not_removed,same
Android,not_removed,damn youre lucky yeah maybe its a tmobile thing
Android,not_removed,but i can count on that since its either fb messenger or telegram im so inclined to find out why sms is popular in canada and the us seriously why do people not use anything else its not like they dont have anything else installed i bet they could easily switch but they dont want to for some reason out of my mind i assume you are using sms why dont you use something else that is better sure there might be a small number of contacts which you rarely must use sms for but for the majority of messages im should work or does people only have a phone and not a tablet laptop or desktop that they regularly use in my opinion allo would be worse with sms because i can only assume huge amount of features would have to be disabled for sms conversations just use another app i dont understand the need for a giant clustered slow app for everything
Android,not_removed,i think it would be cool to set alarms and things just have a x tried setting alarm for y accept
Android,not_removed,i see makes sense thank you for clarifying
Android,not_removed,yes but it doesnt give that out the user that someone is online or offline i dont think you are getting what im saying by a user is online i dont mean they would checkin to let people know they are free to talk i mean google servers would check to see if they are connected to their servers and would allow allo messages to be sent to them if they are iphone does this by showing imessages in blue or something like that when a message was sent through their imessage service rather than through sms they want to be able to send stickers whisper shouts and they wanted google messenger built in i understand that thats why allo in this hypothetical where allo can send sms similar to imessage would default to sending someone an allo message if they are available to receive them if not it would just not allow these stickers whispers etc sms is like using dialup to send a message so i think youre missing my point again sms works it is very reliable and it is not unbearably slow it just takes a second or two to receive one that is not an outrageous amount of time and the large majority of people would never notice that type of lag there really isnt an attempt to force you to use it though i dont mean force in the sense that they are taking away sms messaging i mean in the small amount of force that they are sending out invites on your behalf whenever you message someone who doesnt have allo and if you dont accept the invite then you just have to communicate through this strange robot number that is transporting your messages its just that it could end up making another hangouts support everything and then make it bloated out and unreliable again missing my point i specifically said that the implementation used by hangout was bad they do not need to do that again they have another chance with allo to make the ux seamless between sms and internetbased messaging i am not sure if they can do the reading your sms thing because of fcc rules not a technical issue even if thats the case they wouldnt need to be able to read them with the current feature set so heres the thing with imessages it requires carrier integration so the carrier has to have a device on the backend to enable imessages to work with an iphone where are you getting that claim from and what would google not be able to do without this type of integration android allows sending sms through nonstock messaging apps and the allo app can easily make a decision on whether or not it should send an sms or allo message what else would they need the only reason i see google needing access to a networks sms service is if they want to take sent sms messages to integrate them into allo conversations if they were to make an allo desktop client if this was the case google could just have you sign away the right for google to intercept your messages on an android system level and read the sentreceived messages from your android phone and also people can switch sms apps on android people cannot switch sms apps on the iphone that is an amazing feature that i love about android but again it is a hassle when its possible for all conversations to just be linked to one app in their calculus also quit saying calculus outside of its actual meaning i hate to be a nitpicky dick but nothing of what were discussing is calculus based use a more general word like calculations or something like that
Android,not_removed,and thats something we clearly dont care about
Android,not_removed,i wouldnt say thats the whole point of allo but it is a very key feature the large majority of messages sent through allo are going to be just plain text short messages that could have been sent as an sms if a user somehow loses their internet connection but is still able to text which is rare but still possible it would be extremely convenient for allo to just shoot them a text rather than moving your conversation over to another messaging app if all of your friends use allo but one other friend is still using a flip phone it would again be extremely convenient to have all of your messaging conversations in one app rather than moving back and forth between the depending on who you are trying to talk to of course i have nothing to really back this other than my theory but i believe sms integration would dramatically increase allos adoption rate rather than invites being sent out by robot texts which i think they should partially keep in just to make inviting people easy people would have sms conversations within the allo app which would naturally lead to the person with allo to tell someone through sms that they should try allo to use the features they already have access to its not a creepy invitation that came from no where its a natural suggestion to try something from a friend that you will want to try because that friend of yours is pretty cool this method of inviting people would be slower than just forcing people to on message allo users through the allo app but its more natural and would integrate into a users currently existing messaging habits in the sense that they can continue sending sms messages through allo and because its more natural and seamless it would most likely keep users over a longer period of time i understand the wanting for allo to stay pure and continue to do what it does now but having conversations with multiple people through multiple apps is a hassle and user experience could be largely improved by having an allinone app that makes all your messaging needs hasslefree
Android,not_removed,i have nothing against your preference i simply think running it in a web browser makes more sense to the broader audience
Android,not_removed,then it crashes
Android,not_removed,is it iirc there was never a login for my google credentials
Android,not_removed,the official app is lacking in quite a few features from what i hear just about all the third party apps support sorting comments
Android,not_removed,why are you pushing back on sms because you dont use it its obvious from this sub that many do and many want it it doesnt matter the reason if a large part of a companys customer base wantsrequires a specific feature then that company should probably implement it regardless of whether this one guy says its unnecessary
Android,not_removed,but i can count on that since its either fb messenger or telegram good for you people having a different use case doesnt make them isheep they already told you the benefit of sms ubiquity even in your case youve already made clear that people are split across two services and there will generally be a couple of people who dont have any of the main ones having to switch between services for different contacts is precisely what theyre talking about its an unecessary hassle id much rather see rcs take over as the standard but until then sms is the guaranteed standard we have which any mobile phone can deal with i dont understand the need for a giant clustered slow app for everything its not for everything its for messaging with the universal standard integrated like imessage which isnt cluttered or slow youre simply making baseless claims about this because you dont want a feature no idea why youre so keen to push that on to everyone else
Android,not_removed,stop being so selfcentred youre incredibly ignorant too and stop it with the toddler logic you may not like using sms but other people do not everyone needs to send picturesvideos or participate in group chats some people just want to send a simple text with a guarantee that the other persons device will receive it i dont expect someone selling something on kijijicraigslist to have telegram installed i send them a text and they respond its as simple as that whats funny and sad at the same time is that sms support in allo has absolutely no effect on you yet here you are poorly attempting to understand why anyone would want sms support
Android,not_removed,i was thinking the same if someone were to say google set a reminder to meetup at the park at then maybe assistant would set it for that person but then for everyone else say i am going to remind x to meetup at the park at would you like me to remind you as well same with other actions like timers alarms calendar events etc
Android,not_removed,youre not google
Android,not_removed,the problem is that google probably feels that the current system will push more people especially ios users to download the app than using a hangoutslike sms implementation that implementation was removed from hangouts probably for the same reason imessage users dont bother to switch if it comes as standard sms
Android,not_removed,it automatically uses the google account your phone is signed in with if you only have one account set up if you have multiple google accounts on your phone then you get a prompt open allo and go into settings and one of the options will be to unlink your google account unless you somehow installed allo without having a google account set up on your phone then i dunno what happens
Android,not_removed,yeah its a must for me i hate the default sorting by best
Android,not_removed,no im a user of their services or at least i would be if they didnt half ass it
Android,not_removed,again your priorities are different than theirs doesnt mean that they cant communicate better
Android,not_removed,theyre a consumer software business the priorities of their users are their priorities
Android,not_removed,i wish that were true
Android,not_removed,this is clearly a stolen video from channel in fact majority of videos on this channel are stolen original video
Android,not_removed,i honestly miss my
Android,not_removed,the update came out in december why bother reviewing it after more than months
Android,not_removed,was a good phone got it for the screen but had excellent camera and autofocus at close range
Android,not_removed,yeah it was the first phone with a qhd display but it had problems since it was the first one the screen ate that battery lol
Android,not_removed,go launcher and cm launcher are ads and spam
Android,not_removed,i really hope you forgot to include the s at the end
Android,not_removed,why there arent huwaei phones in the stats
Android,not_removed,report based on actual data motorola pushes out updates the fastest in the us randroid i doubt the moto x will even get nougat
Android,not_removed,i may have missed it but how do they get their data i would rather see a report based on when manufacturers officially release an update rather than the network traffic or whatever they were trying to get at
Android,not_removed,im just here on my android one from a noname manufacturer device snacking on nougat
Android,not_removed,if this data wasnt exclusive to this us i think xiaomi is at the top with the fastest security updates not sure about previous months but they got september patch a few weeks ago
Android,not_removed,how does this adjust for carrier lg released mm for the in poland months before verizon did in the us do they count variants as different devices
Android,not_removed,why no blackberry in the stats
Android,not_removed,will take on the note will be the first android nougat smartphone hm
Android,not_removed,kind of shit how its just the big names ive had security updates land on my nextbit robin before my nexus in the past
Android,not_removed,literally the least important thing when selecting a phone
Android,not_removed,no xiaomi either guess its cause they dont really sell muchat all in the us
Android,not_removed,huawei is actually extremely quick for a heavy skin like emui id be curious to see how they do xiaomi too they wipe the floor with everyone when it comes to security patches
Android,not_removed,nah i dont think people here ignore facts to sustain their own narratives that would really decrease the quality of the discussions here and id definitely notice
Android,not_removed,fastest support over time
Android,not_removed,lenovo did themselves no favors by initially eolling so many devices when they first took over motorola as the saying goes a good stigma always licks a good dogma
Android,not_removed,hmmmmy moto still has a security patch level of december
Android,not_removed,dae lenovorola sucks amright guyz
Android,not_removed,my droid turbo would like a word with you
Android,not_removed,i may have missed it but how do they get their data i dont know im not an expert but i think network traffic could be useful because it measures how many devices actually installed the update not just when the oem released it the manufacturer could release a new update but that doesnt necessarily mean that most users who have devices that support the update have actually installed it yet there could be an issue of some users changing user agents but i dont really know
Android,not_removed,bottom of the pdf they take data from what apps using their sdk report our data is benchmarked across tens of thousands of mobile apps representing hundreds of millions of application launches adoption rate is based on app loads and network data which means it is based on actual usage of the operating system you may see slightly different numbers reported in the future by apple which are solely based on activations vs actual device usage you can find mobile industry benchmarks updated daily at dataapteligentcom in addition every month we publish a recap of the trends and movements in the industry
Android,not_removed,same here
Android,not_removed,android one is such a great move by google i wish they would sell them in more countries no one should be using a shitty phone stuck with jelly bean
Android,not_removed,this is by manufacturer so lg pushing the update to internationalcarrier unlocked phones is on them its the carriers that add extra months to that time not the manufacturers fault
Android,not_removed,sales too low i suspect but they would be among the fastest to release updates i get updates every month at least
Android,not_removed,mind if i see some proof not that i dont believe you nexus gets updates the fastest as far as i know its not really the other way around
Android,not_removed,lite here android emui european firmwarelast security patch is dated july i dont know if its good or bad and yes emui is surprisingly fast for such a heavy skin
Android,not_removed,what about normal updates
Android,not_removed,good point theres quickness for the first update quickness for later updates quickness for security patches and how many months a device is supported
Android,not_removed,theres a pretty big difference between concerns over poor security patch support on budget devices sadly quite common with most oems and concerns that a year old flagship wont get a major android update
Android,not_removed,tfw no marshmallow
Android,not_removed,whether or not users install it isnt really the issue though is it i mean yes its useful data but its not a reflection on how well the oem is doing at releasing updates
Android,not_removed,it really is its been called poor mans nexus in the tech sites ive visited i just hope they continue it i remember articles saying the android one program was shutting down
Android,not_removed,android one phones dont sell in meaningful numbers since smaller oems took that market already
Android,not_removed,if i remember correctly google releases information for oems a month in advance in order for them to prepare an update or something like that
Android,not_removed,ahh so it ignored it entirely i guess either way of calculating is equally valid
Android,not_removed,thats mostly security updates this article is mainly talking about os updates
Android,not_removed,i think so to isnt blackberrys market share similar to windows phone
Android,not_removed,not too sure how i would prove that but yes twice in the past my robin has received a security update a few days before my i rarely seem to get a new update on my nexus the same day its released in the us
Android,not_removed,nexus is fast but its never the fastest because xiaomi is alongside blackberry from time to time
Android,not_removed,not nearly as good but they should still be able to get a pretty high rating with their security patch support and miui updates every week
Android,not_removed,isnt the moto g their most popular phone though in a way you could call it a flagship for motorola
Android,not_removed,i just miss my old nexus which developed a broken power button i decided to pick up a used moto for the time being not the wisest choice i know i could root it and install cm but im not the most comfortable with doing that stuff on a nonnexus device the only time ive rooted is with my gnex
Android,not_removed,yeah i agree but i really find actually installed data useful as well my uncles never updated at all because there just wasnt room install the update with the amount of bloat samsung and att put on there
Android,not_removed,yep and theyre month late on purpose which is why the patches are labeled like this eg september patch in early august and it also allows for crazy conspiracy theories about xiaomi lying about patch level and editing buildprop to fool customers
Android,not_removed,they would need a separate post about which carriers push updates out the fastest
Android,not_removed,it could be argued that security updates are os updates even if they dont add features even there bb is not bad ive had or marshmallow updates in the last months none of which fixed the bluetooth bug with head units
Android,not_removed,lower even in the uscanada in south africa indonesia and a couple of other bb is higher in sa still higher than iphone i think
Android,not_removed,sort of but people have a different set of expectations for inexpensive goods they can get away with having poor support for security patches on the moto g because of its budget status and the nature of its demographic i mean look at blu theyre doing just fine and with blu you basically sign up for zero software support of pretty much any real significance in exchange for a great deal on hardware i think its a scumbag move to not devote more resources to security patches but most of the people that care about that are buying expensive flagships
Android,not_removed,it can be but the article is talking about fragmentation which is how on android there are still many phones being on ice cream sandwich lollipop and still a small amount on marshmallow security updates are a completely different issue bb is probly the best with security updates i think they even beat the nexus devices with the august security update also samsung seems to really be taking the security updates seriously with their new devices
Android,not_removed,phone is awesone except for battery hours of sot tops battery is this phones weakness i paid less than year ago and am happy speakers display and camera are great also love the minimalistic skin moto puts unsure if id be happier with the moto z play for the little bit more of it costs
Android,not_removed,battery is mediocre if you really are careful about conserving you can can maybe get hours sot typically youll get around also the nougat update is taking forever its supposed to come in the next few months the screen and speakers are incredible the bezels are nice the camera is alright nothing like the pixel but not terrible one thing i didnt really see in reviews the vibration motor is terrible its loud as hell absolute trash
Android,not_removed,i had it dual stereo front facing speakers are awesome i wish i had them in my current phone
Android,not_removed,owned it since day after i upgraded from my htc dna my favorite phone to date overall i loved the phone but here are my launch day pro and cons vs my current pros and cons launch day pros gorgeous screen dual facing speakers that are loud this is a huge one good battery life nice additional moto features and qol gestures like ambient display and whats up voice commands expandable memory snappy and responsive handsfree features are godlike fast support received marshmallow in december of cons no fingerprint reader didnt effect me much got hot during long bouts of sot maybe a little too big uncomfortable for onehanded usage camera is ok not gonna give samsung a run for its money anytime soon slowmo is nice but video quality is lacking options are also lacking ambient display is useful but due to a nonamoled screen it looks a lot uglier and takes up more battery at launch i really dug the shit outta this thing it did absolutely everything i wanted it to on a budget that was reasonable and was a goodlooking thing too the pure android skin was super responsive and the battery lasted me from am to am with a little juice left over fast forward to today current day pros dual facing speakers seriously these are a godsend dont know if ill be able to get another phone without these handsfree features when they work screen still looks good ambient display is still pretty nice cons support has been weak since marshmallow stayed at for almost a year before even the first security patch was sent ota still dont have nougat and dont know when it will release official charger died less than a year after i got it voice commands dont work nearly as well anymore phone has gotten very slow i dont know if this is a marshmallow thing or a motorola thing but the phones responsiveness has definitely taken a nosedive its definitely a tad too big juuuuuust big enough to be uncomfortable to hold in your hand for more than a few seconds at a time part of my screen has a red burnin on it on dimmer brightness settings no idea what caused it many moto features have just been abandoned inlieu of googles alternatives though i liked a lot of motos stuff better after attempting many candid photos of various cooking sessions the phones camera replicates color pretty poorly and doesnt do well in lowlight in daylight its fine even pretty good in some scenarios but indoors it really suffers overall i still like the phone but im noticing ive been less patient with the moto x than i ever was with my dna im leaning towards getting a oneplus something that works on verizon sometime in the summer or whatever theyll be making next
Android,not_removed,an moto x pure edition with a fingerprint scanner in the dimple would be perfect
Android,not_removed,sold it for a pixel a couple months ago i loved it though heres some pros and cons compared to the pixel con poor battery life especially with all the features enabled like wave to wake lagged way behind in android updates a bit too big and heavy for me shape is weird for things like google cardboard pro best speakers ive ever used on a smartphone great camera with awesome twist to activate feature big super bright screen
Android,not_removed,had this phone since its release in the uk what hasnt changed speed its still almost as snappy as when i bought it has its janky moments but nothing too much to worry about screen still nice and crisp camera is still fairly good in good light never has been in low light though speakers stereo speakers are still great distorts on high volumes with certain music though fast charging is still a godsend for me battery still average but i dont think it has deteriorated the fact i am still on bloody marshmallow what has changed my volume down button no longer works couple of blue blotches on the screen im not technical enough to know what this is probably burn in or just my fault since i noticed it after a messy night out that bumper case gave way fairly quickly but i wasnt expecting much different original charger started to deteriorate after about months after the phone kept thinking it was charging via usb got a replacement i had to reset phone via the back door once after it got stuck in a bootloop all in all nothing too major except for the fact i dont think i can screenshot anything ever again however this will be the last motorola from me without a doubt switching to the pixel for my next phone sick of slow updates
Android,not_removed,you can get the wood shells on a moto z but with way better battery life
Android,not_removed,mine is still in pristine shape i still love it like its day i havent had any issues at all battery gets me through the day with ease speakers still sound great with no hissing or popping screen has no scratches and i dont use screen protectors i will admit im not a power user i dont play games or do much social media i do listen to a ton of music and watch movies and videos i have the silicone rubber back and even it shows no signs of age only until now that the lg has been introduced i hadnt seen a phone that made me want to bench my mxpe
Android,not_removed,cant comment on the camera but my mxpe battery went to shite pretty quickly it barely gets hours of sot on a good day im currently using it to test out verizon coverage against my att service at work and ive been constantly reminded why i loved the axon so much its pretty much the spiritual successor to the moto x i do miss the moto enhancements though speakers are great but i dont think its worth suffering through the issues ive had to deal with
Android,not_removed,owned the mxpe since september still use it as my daily driver but im starting to get itchy ive bought a nextbit robin to tinker with and build roms i may switch to using the robin or buy a new midrange phone in the next few months i liked the nearstock experience and the few moto extras were actually useful as the phone has aged it hasnt aged well in particular lenovos handling of the nougat upgrades has soured me on the phone battery life good not great didnt suck quickcharge helped this immensely could go from to in the time it took to get lunch speakers i play music from the phone daily but to a bluetooth speaker the few times ive played music or made a call over the speaker it seems theyre pretty anemic a couple times i resorted to making a ghetto sound tube from a toilet paper roll i didnt realize there were dual speakers to be honest camera very good i like the moto camera app more than the google camera the tap to snap feature is better than having a shutter button imho qualitywise i couldnt say i dont use my phone as an artistic camera its for quick snaps when i dont have a dslr handy performance good not great ive had a half dozen occasions in the last months where the phone suddenly stopped responding to input usually when bluetooth was connected and a forced reboot was necessary i dont do anything requiring high performance but i definitely notice some lag when im playing music gpm and try to surf reddit simultaneously network support fair at best the tmo network where i live is terrible and i couldnt get more than on att i at least get hsdpa every phone ive owned sucked equally at this so its not motos fault i have an att microcell while this gives better call quality i have to manually connect by toggling airplane mode for seconds kind of a pain in the ass to do every time i get home my kids phones iphone and samsung connect when they are in range updates mostly terrible got mm quickly never got the update that fixed some bluetooth issues some models did but not the unlocked gsm security updates are sporadic but they do happen i have had to do the to get them to happen over ota screen decent i dont consume media on my phone i have the red dots that others mention and it kinda pisses me off clearly a defective display and not limited to my unit i unlocked the bootloader a couple months ago when it seemed obvious the phone would not get nougat i held off until last week when i wiped and installed lineage battery life is better under lineage than stock by a little bit itll keep me going a little longer but if something happens to the phone i wont waste time or money repairing it
Android,not_removed,had mine since november just recently flashed lineageos as i got tired of waiting for moto to push the nougat ota all in all the phone has been great i upgraded from a moto x and although the pure is big i quickly came to like the large screen for media consumption battery life is my one major complaint and has been since day with lineage i saw a bit of a bump but still cant manage much more than hours sot over hour period i have one dead pixel that i noticed two weeks after purchasing but thats the only defect usb port works fine with all of my chargers including the moto turbocharger that came with the phone speakers still impress me camera is solid in good light and the form factor with dimple is still one of my favorites ever produced by an oem
Android,not_removed,someone remembers me and the phone exist mild degradation of battery life but that might be because my battery saving software isnt as aggressive anymore wishing it had better custom roms the sd can freeze pretty hard sometimes
Android,not_removed,just broke my screen for the second time to me the pure is too big hopefully the plus reviews well and has the moto suite of movements jedi handwave and chop otherwise i will have to weigh the cost of fixing the screen vs finding another phone in the price range thats smaller any recommendations
Android,not_removed,fuck this phone dont get this especially in its truly outdated it doesnt have a fingerprint scanner and still uses microusb this phone will not age well even if you flash lineage youll be better off buying something more modern because this thing just feels dated and motorola takes forever to update
Android,not_removed,speakers were awesome but i traded up for a mate no regrets at all camera is far better and the battery literally lasts for days
Android,not_removed,running linage os on mines no complaints whatsoever can and will keepfor at least another yrs possibly even longer
Android,not_removed,question coming from a mpe owner would buying the moto plus be a decent upgrade
Android,not_removed,i have only had mine for months but so far so good i came from a note and i have to say that it is as good as the note in every way besides the camera i will buy a flagship phone in the coming months and let me wife have the moto x i still could used a little more processing power but i am a pretty heavy user this phone is all that of the population could ever need
Android,not_removed,its been a pretty good phone the dual front speakers are awesome and i love having expandable storage ive started using android pay and not having a finger print sensor to unlock is annoying the camera is not great the twist to open gesture is cool but it has poor low light performance and it really struggles to focus when you get up close to objects the ambient display is a great feature i love being able to just wave my hand over the display to see if i have any notifications or see the time yesterday i was on a long call and all the sudden it decided to reboot and then dropped the call later i was sitting right next to a window in my first floor apartment mind you screen on time is not great i can squeeze out maybe hours the fast charging is great though all in all im still relatively happy with it its not laggy at all except in certain apps like google play music not sure what ill get next the looks interesting and id like a pixel but at this point i might as well wait for the pixel
Android,not_removed,my usb port is going honestly the only reason im planning to upgrade soon other than that issue its still holding its own
Android,not_removed,i love mine only complaints are battery has been soso its surprisingly heavy speakerphone has never seemed to work right
Android,not_removed,it was just fine until it broke just days outside of year warranty soft keys became unresponsive factory reboot didnt fix it made the phone useless that was my last motorola im with sony now and i love it
Android,not_removed,wasnt it supposed to get nougat in december
Android,not_removed,usb port acts wonky and the headphone jack as well just upgraded to the moto z battery life really was results may vary lol also performance was really awful sometimes just get a z play off of swappa if you can save a bit more
Android,not_removed,ive replaced the screen twice plan on keeping it for a while really had been a great performer
Android,not_removed,works well battery is shit though slow updates too big surprise there
Android,not_removed,quite fragile my screen has broken twice even though i am very careful i had my xperia z original for years without breaking it battery time is awful i cant get through a whole day without dropping into the low percents also the camera app is awful im also disappointed in no nougat so far as the ui is extremely close to vanilla android i cant figure out whats taking so long what i do like is the display and the speakers
Android,not_removed,love it just wish it had a faster cpu and better battery life those are my only real complaints but overall im still happy and hesitant to replace it
Android,not_removed,my sister had one i sold it for her she was only getting around hours sot she has a moto z play now and the battery life is way better she is usually around at the end of the day
Android,not_removed,one of my front speaker grills just started to wobble so not well
Android,not_removed,overall it held up well and has survived several falls from a stairmaster past few weeks ive been having a battery bug where it will cut off at and the phone will think the battery has died or it will take several restarts that drain the battery to around
Android,not_removed,horrible battery lifeits big and heavy so so camerafor its ok and all its worth
Android,not_removed,its just great dual speakers large screen fast charging and the curve at the back i wont change that phone until someone creates bezeless phone with front facing dual speakers 🤕
Android,not_removed,upgraded to a moto z play from x pure a few months ago the battery alone is totally worth it imo
Android,not_removed,if you need a great upgrade with amazing dual front facing speakers look no further than the zte axon its an amazing phone at midrange price and it got nougat recently but is coming very soon i love it and my previous android phone was a nexus
Android,not_removed,i have the same red burn in issue on my xiaomi i honestly dont know what happened
Android,not_removed,thanks for this
Android,not_removed,fwiw im pretty sure that the chinese variant of the supports verizons cdma bands dunno why but it does
Android,not_removed,i checked out a friends moto x pure recently i really loved its design shame it was let down by a poor soc
Android,not_removed,man i can only dream although im seriously considering the moto z successor as my next phone because of moto mods
Android,not_removed,thanks only thing holding me back is battery
Android,not_removed,good point im seriously considering the z successor as my next phone the current version battery is just way too small
Android,not_removed,what about it feels dated front speakers the optional style back covers its not worth getting in but its two years old what phone is imo moto display is just as good a replacement for fingerprint
Android,not_removed,nothing about this phone is dated i can take the point on nougat but not the others your chargers didnt all magically change to usbc when the first usbc phone came out most people arent using usbc unless theyre on the early adopter or oneyear cycle read not most people will be the year that well see a large transition to usbc but its not there just yet id agree with this point in though fingerprint scanner does not do much today except enable a simpler way to unlock your phone only some apps that would benefit from biometrics are starting to adopt fingerprint scanner as a way to authenticate again i might agree with this in but right now im not hampered by a lack of fingerprint scanner heres my take for those still looking at the viability of the phone if youre looking for a bridge to go for the cheaper of either the moto or the moto x pure depending on what you can find and lean your preference toward nfc and larger size x pure or fingerprint scanner and smaller size
Android,not_removed,nexus is doing great in comparison though and that one doesnt have a fingerprint sensor either if similar roms can be installed to it id imagine it wouldnt be that bad
Android,not_removed,other than fingerprint sensor not really an upgrade might want to look at axon instead when it goes on sale
Android,not_removed,its more of a lateral move with tradeoffs youll gain a fingerprint sensor and increased battery life but will take a minor loss in processing power nfc and dual frontfacing speakers i struggled this too as im considering an upgrade but theres not enough here yet to justify a switch in my opinion im waiting for the z lineup or next years g series
Android,not_removed,yup they keep delaying it latest i heard was sometime before june fortunately marshmallow isnt too bad that it is only a slight annoyance that we dont have nougat yet
Android,not_removed,how long have you had it im thinking about switching to verizon and ive had my eye on this guy because of the superb battery
Android,not_removed,same
Android,not_removed,what kind of display is it
Android,not_removed,i completely disagree i came from the x with an amoled display and the change was terrible it looks dim and very grey
Android,not_removed,coming from the nexus hows the camera for you ive upgraded to the and i feel like its a bit of downgrade about that aspect
Android,not_removed,i love the axon my only complaint is that verizon had to be dicks and not approve it for their network because im thinking of switching to them verizon has nothing like the axon in their store it makes me sad
Android,not_removed,i returned the axon i had too many issues with it stopping spotify in the car was the final deal breaker for me
Android,not_removed,no worries ive had new phones on the mind recently but having just spent money on the nintendo switch i cant really justify buying anything
Android,not_removed,thats even dumber
Android,not_removed,there is nothing wrong with that soc it doesnt heat up nearly as much as the and still has plenty of speed
Android,not_removed,you can get the z play i have it and the battery is amazing
Android,not_removed,nexus is doing great in comparison though and that one doesnt have a fingerprint sensor either to be fair its really hard to go back to a device thay doesnt have it ive been using my pure to test verizon coverage and ive been mashing on the dimple and getting mad when the phone doesnt unlock
Android,not_removed,i was choosing between the nexus and moto x pure a while back ended up with the nexus because of a good sale price im still very happy with my nexus but i am a little envious of the moto x having a processor if both were available at the same price id probably opt for the x pure but theyre pretty close
Android,not_removed,hope you dont use the camera because the z plays is complete trash ive never taken a shot that looks great with it they all look mediocre or bad always blurry soft and out of focus unless i stand still take a minimum of three shots which takes a couple of minutes
Android,not_removed,had it since november the other guy is right about the compromises and subpar camera but ive yet to go under battery at the end of the day with upwards of hours sot ive realized battery is the thing i care about
Android,not_removed,yeah the camera is the one thing that is still better on the but the axon camera is actually pretty good especially since nougat they improved the autofocus its really not fair behind the now
Android,not_removed,your best bet is probably the moto z force with a big battery youd get comparable battery life not as good as the z play but you dont loose out on the top tier performance with the of ram and daydream compatibility you get pretty decent updates pretty sure its had nougat for a while but dont count on getting updates forever look at the original droid turbo you cant really get the front facing speakers but there is the jbl mod that somewhat satisfies the speaker problem missing a headphone jack but i recall seeing a mod being made that included one
Android,not_removed,can you not use one of the vzw mvnos like total wireless or boom on an theyre limited speed mbps but if verizon is your only option for reliable service seems like a tolerable compromise
Android,not_removed,that sucks
Android,not_removed,they fixed that in the nougat update actually
Android,not_removed,the chokes on the display and while cooler than the still runs warm compared to socs like the or
Android,not_removed,my runs like a dream compared to the old in my the got hot within minutes and would regularly push and then sputter while my pixel barely gets above c during the most intensive of games while not lagging one bit
Android,not_removed,dont be envious i moved from a nexus to a nexus and i missed my snapdragon every day
Android,not_removed,pffftt the last thing i care about on a phone is the camera as long as its not blurry within of me im totally ok with it
Android,not_removed,wouldnt say its complete trash the autofocus is indeed godawful but if you manually set it you can get some pretty decent shots
Android,not_removed,man everyone shits on the z play camera but i think its fine you just need a steady hand and some light its not great in low light but not many mid range are
Android,not_removed,ive yet to go under battery at the end of the day with upwards of hours sot heavy breathing
Android,not_removed,with the turbo recently getting it might be better than previous years its probably better to wait on moto phones since were only a few months away from the lineup the looks very interesting
Android,not_removed,i cant make any calls with it ever since the nougat update verizon and their mvno users have had issues having a stable connection
Android,not_removed,oh well the nougat update was miles away when i returned mine p
Android,not_removed,has this been confirmed anywhere i may get one again now its got nougat
Android,not_removed,my doesnt heat up unless under heavy gaming your heated because it was encrypted which suffered the same problem as priv the pure were not encrypted and ran smoothly
Android,not_removed,mustve been a very dissatisfying downgrade atleast you have the best of the best now
Android,not_removed,oh if you can take that and dont use much apps you should be fine because this phone also cant hold more than three apps in memory before it starts reloading apps
Android,not_removed,well thats a big ol bag of dicks is it just stock axon sw issues or does this happen with lineage os nougat as well
Android,not_removed,fair enough p
Android,not_removed,i have one and its fixed
Android,not_removed,my was unencrypted i did it specifically to make it faster yet it still made no difference in the end mine still ran like shit after unencryption
Android,not_removed,the axon is pretty aggressive about closing apps as well because of the overbearing power manager
Android,not_removed,i cant really say about lineage but i have heard of similar issues there as well on top of a stack of other problems like mono sound and random battery drains and instability the chinese model is already getting so i hope that we get it here im the states within the next month or so i think lineage will get there eventually but not before i make the decision to stay with att or switch to verizon fortunately i have a mxpe lying around so i wont have to fork over money for a phone until either party gets it sorted it sure would just be fucking easier for verizon to give zte the thumbs up
Android,not_removed,ah cool greatness
Android,not_removed,running like shit is not the fault of the soc when your phone only had ram
Android,not_removed,should be happy with it though the can get a little stuttery at times itll start lagging when im scrolling through the frontpage of reddit randomly also even though the is bit the os is bit so keep that in mind when sideloading apps
Android,not_removed,thats an odd curveball
Android,not_removed,it helps save battery or something
Android,not_removed,well its clearly working based on the reports of battery life
Android,not_removed,yep i hit hours sot with heavy use on wifi but i dont like the compromises i have to make mainly ram management and camera so idk if i want to keep it lol
Android,not_removed,thats impressive i got on wifi and in the wild before the update i imagine that the would help it i dont have much faith in anything verizon carries in their stores to match it thats affordable

Android,not_removed,can we just ban forbescom from this sub
Android,not_removed,cant believe he actually thought evans tweet was serious wow
Android,not_removed,i didnt think it was possible for me to take forbes less seriously than i already do but this article convinced me otherwise
Android,not_removed,evan was totally serious and in three months we are all staggered
Android,not_removed,if you set a macro to scroll back and forth im pretty sure you could use the verge as a burnin test to set thermal paste
Android,not_removed,the verge can now consider itself in the fine company of these other websites that are also in aosp for performance tests httpsandroidgooglesourcecomplatformexternalwebkitmasterperformancetestsparserresourcesfinalurlen call me when you actually thats from the first sdk android milestone
Android,not_removed,the verge loads obnoxiously slow on my nexus it took a full seconds before anything was even shown on chrome when i just tested it i never go to the verge on my smartphone and even then it just loaded the header then took another to seconds to load the rest of the site before giving me a full screen ad
Android,not_removed,how should i read this as a promotional placementagreement or according to many users the website loads slow and google is confident their phones will show speed by loading such a slow site
Android,not_removed,im not surprised its been my own personal benchmark for different browsers and tests of aboutconfig tweaks in desktop firefox the website is horrendously built with over a dozen different domains that get reached out to for all of their ad trackers and heavy css even with all of their ads blocked firefox mobile scrolling on the site is awful compared to mobile chrome im noticing better performance in the mobile nightly but its still pretty bad if you can run the verge you can handle pretty much any site if only nilay wouldnt try to shift the blame to browsers
Android,not_removed,shit site
Android,not_removed,only takes like seconds on my but chrome beta takes seconds from tapping the icon to being able to type a web address so
Android,not_removed,weird the verge is superfast on my iphone
Android,not_removed,seconds on my nexus chrome though my wifi is rather slow at mbps
Android,not_removed,disabling javascript makes it load faster its insane if you can give up looking at images video and comments and just want to read articles its a much smoother experience
Android,not_removed,some day we may have the technology to run the verges mobile site on a phone but today its just a pipe dream
Android,not_removed,people still visit the verge
Android,not_removed,i dont get it i get like seconds for all the content on my x pure
Android,not_removed,last week tonight with john oliver online harassment ah so even they joke about people who harass them online
Android,not_removed,open the site on my nexus using opera and the site loaded in sec im not even using
Android,not_removed,thats funny i used to work for a company that had a massive desktop application with an embedded browser in it i also used the verge to benchmark its memory leaking and performance
Android,not_removed,droid turbo here the verge does not lag at all for me no stuttering no issues at all on my device running no adblock
Android,not_removed,its definitely a bloated site but the mobile version loads quickly and is buttery smooth on the note snapdragon using samsungs internet browser with crystal adblock plugin samsung browser is very underrated imo and is much fastersmoother than chrome which is my goto desktop browser
Android,not_removed,the site loads pretty fast on my iphone with a content blocker
Android,not_removed,iverge
Android,not_removed,i cant stand using chrome on android i just timed it on my honor using yubrowser ad blocking and it was which was almost as quick as my with content blocking at browser makes a big difference even on my nonsnapdragon chip i suggest anyone using chrome on a sd device to ditch it for an optimized browser like yubrowser
Android,not_removed,optimized by fruitheads for fruitheads
Android,not_removed,i laughed at this way too much to admit but the fucking site is ridiculously designed who the hell makes the site so heavy and bloated can someone with an iphone comment on how the site feels for them on the phone
Android,not_removed,site works just fine on my
Android,not_removed,arstechverge
Android,not_removed,just over seconds to fully load on my galaxy in chrome
Android,not_removed,thats because the site is a pile of trash so many frameworks and copy pastes from stack overflow the site was made by the kind of people who like to call themselves developers but really work full time as a barista they give real developers a bad name
Android,not_removed,surely not takes to load a page on my priv in yandex which is chrome based but has ad blocking would expect chrome to be ahead of yandex and a to be ahead of an powered device
Android,not_removed,i dont see how thevergecom loads fast for me on data and wifi and performs exactly as expected on my
Android,not_removed,i cant not block ads on the verge they destroy performance on the site and its unacceptable
Android,not_removed,seconds no wifi tmobile northern california inbetween sac and san fran seconds and i tested that on a galaxy edge
Android,not_removed,the whole vox family of sites are trash the complete redo of sbnation has made it impossible to navigate and loads slower than android studio on my laptop
Android,not_removed,i usually wait for it to fully load or else i get very significant touch delays and occasional microstutters
Android,not_removed,it took hours on my phone i was staring at a white page for most of that time what the fuck
Android,not_removed,on my sec for all elements to load and another few sec for images to catch up
Android,not_removed,thats odd it loaded the entire site in under a second on my
Android,not_removed,really seconds for me to the header by i could read the blocks of headlines
Android,not_removed,seconds on my but thats with ad blocking im not trying it without because i dont want to kill my phone
Android,not_removed,took me about seconds on my oneplus one legit
Android,not_removed,i have known of the verge being used as a benchmark for quite a few years now i definitely recall it being used for benchmarking device browser performance its always been a pretty heavy site
Android,not_removed,the verge is incredibly heavy website makes sense to do testing speedoptimizations against this site
Android,not_removed,takes a lot of juice to load all that apple bias
Android,not_removed,i always see iphone users complain about how slow it is to load that website it loads pretty much the same speed on my iphone as on my nexus its an acceptable speed but its still one of the slower to load web pages on both devices
Android,not_removed,wew lad
Android,not_removed,same for me too must be the ad blocker
Android,not_removed,im so sorry about that wifi can i send you a care package
Android,not_removed,key word is content blocker theres huge header ads and other ads on the verge
Android,not_removed,content blocker
Android,not_removed,it should  processors smoke everything in single core performance which is one reason javascript runs fast on an iphone
Android,not_removed,i find that hard to believe did you clear your cache etc before the test
Android,not_removed,yubrowser are you fucking kidding me what
Android,not_removed,iphone here feels bloated as a month pregnant woman
Android,not_removed,also iphone its not bad for me provided i have adblockers installed
Android,not_removed,its really smooth on ios for me but i run adblock in safari so none of the bloat can load
Android,not_removed,iphone feels fine but i have content blockers that kill a ton of scripts ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,the verge runs just fine on my note using samsungs browser much better than android authority for example not sure whats the fuzz all about around here
Android,not_removed,same here ive been to some bad sites but the verge seems fine afai can tell
Android,not_removed,vergeverge
Android,not_removed,its under seconds if you use the samsung browser
Android,not_removed,my loaded it in a little over seconds in chrome
Android,not_removed,fully load fourteen seconds on a moto fwiw its four seconds on an iphone se but then its basically an iphone site so d
Android,not_removed,the site was made by the kind of people who like to call themselves developers but really work full time as a barista likewise with the writers
Android,not_removed,but has ad blocking that may be why
Android,not_removed,youd be surprised at how much quicker sites load with adscript blocking
Android,not_removed,yandex have you tried yandex alpha it supports desktop chrome extensions
Android,not_removed,is yandex one of those snapdragon optimized browsers
Android,not_removed,thats weird i am using the pure nexus rom but dont have any slowdowns on other websites my test was on wifi too comcast even doing a pull down to refresh i saw it take seconds to start loading stuff then it hung at around loaded for seconds i gave up and closed chrome before it finished loading the second time
Android,not_removed,it took about to load most the contents i could scroll just fine but not all the images had loaded for me on yubrowser about secs to fully load not bad for an old nexus on the us model doesnt have my local bands
Android,not_removed,ad blocker
Android,not_removed,which is probably why google is using it to test its a big mountain to climb and probably easy to see progress for all the things they test for
Android,not_removed,voxcom is amazing
Android,not_removed,it took minutes on mine ugh
Android,not_removed,even more ironic considering apple probably fucked them over the most by adding ad blockers to mobile safari
Android,not_removed,i was joking iverge trope and all that
Android,not_removed,loads fast for me too but i have a content blocker in safari are you using any without a blocker it is a bit slow
Android,not_removed,it loads pretty fast on my oneplus both in mobile and desktop mode though i do have adblocking enable so that might have something to do with it
Android,not_removed,i always see iphone users complain about how slow it is to load that website always you hang out with an interesting set of people
Android,not_removed,little bit off topic but i suppose it wouldve been apt if i could have recorded it here with the context and all and i cant reproduce it now have you guys sorted out the bullshit adverts you and sites have been suffering from
Android,not_removed,probably largely due to the hardware their cpus still havent gotten touched really
Android,not_removed,just so you know i think the original comment was sarcastic
Android,not_removed,please haha
Android,not_removed,i have a mbps wifi at home so i exclusively use lte even when at home
Android,not_removed,dont forget javascript performance is huge in iphone
Android,not_removed,😂👌
Android,not_removed,the also smokes most everything in multi core
Android,not_removed,hard to believe as in its too slow or too fast didnt clear any cache just opened a new tab
Android,not_removed,it had a bad rep for data mining
Android,not_removed,not kidding at all check it out on the play store
Android,not_removed,aww thats terribly bad then btw how is the phone
Android,not_removed,how do you install ad blockers my vpn has a little ad blocker but its inconsistent edit i didnt know there were ad blocker apps now i thought they were a jailbreak thing they dont seem to be systemwide but its better than nothing
Android,not_removed,how safe is samsungs browser in comparison to chrome
Android,not_removed,yep can confirm one edge
Android,not_removed,it takes tugabrowser about that long maybe less native ad blockers are amazing
Android,not_removed,also under seconds using chrome on my however im using adblock so not sure how the website works without all that shit blocked
Android,not_removed,seconds on edge using samsung browser
Android,not_removed,most add blockers still load the adds
Android,not_removed,no ad blocker chrome dev stock takes secs for most of it to load
Android,not_removed,i have not thats interesting although i cant say i actually use many extensions other than ad blocking
Android,not_removed,nope just a browser built by the russian search company i use it purely as it has the url bar where it should be at the bottom of the screen
Android,not_removed,i have the same internet mbps with twc some apps in background and also got seconds but that was with all the pics one more second for a full page coke ad same rom stock nougat on my so same as op pretty much
Android,not_removed,that would explain why the site doesnt load at all
Android,not_removed,yes adaway
Android,not_removed,what a fantastic tech site
Android,not_removed,very valid point easiest to see improvements in a site which has the most opportunity to improve
Android,not_removed,i dont use content blockers i bet that with a content blocker it would load faster but if im reading content i believe that the content creators should get their ad revenue
Android,not_removed,obviously i didnt mean literally always and i was more referring to people online rather than people i hang out with irl my friends in real life dont give a shit about anything technology and only care about music
Android,not_removed,yes we are actively solving this issue bad ad waves come every now and then but this week in particular we were hit with some nasty crap our ad providers often solve these issues in no time especially if we can nail the wrongdoers but they always come back and this week has been different it sucks because it holds back our biggerbetter articles given we dont want the temporary bad ad experience well any ad experience is bad for many of us to take away from the contents and reading experience so we have to save them for later luckily we produce a lot of original content meaning theres usually no big rush
Android,not_removed,true dunno if they have one though
Android,not_removed,how so first i have heard of this
Android,not_removed,too fast youre loading a cached page meaning youre not loading the full page which isnt a useful test of speed clear the cache and i bet your load time more than triples
Android,not_removed,really hadnt heard of any complaints like that any source you can point me to
Android,not_removed,insanely fast tbh ive never had anything like it ive put it through its paces and it hasnt struggled a single time battery life is pretty good too def satisfied with my purchase probably going to keep it for the next years
Android,not_removed,safe as in samsungs browser is better in literally everything except the ability to sync tabshistory between another device performance features etc and you can use adblock
Android,not_removed,this is objectively wrong
Android,not_removed,thats a crap ad blocker then
Android,not_removed,ah ok fair enough good going for you i dont mind ads but most of the sites that i go have too many ads too big or slow ads or intrusive ads so if they tone it down ill whitelist the whole site
Android,not_removed,i think the iphone has always been like that hasnt it if not the iphone hasnt been matched well in terms of hardware from other phones thank qualcomm for that i guess
Android,not_removed,you should google it my friend you are in a surprise how far iphone is
Android,not_removed,js performance has been substantially better on iphones for years now
Android,not_removed,gotcha i see what youre saying but its not a good real world example i mean i put this time here in comparison to other people who are complaining about how long it takes to load on their phones running chrome chances are their times arent from a non cached state either so this is a more fair and relevant comparison
Android,not_removed,googling doesnt bring up anything maybe theyre thinking of the similarly named but entirely different uc browser because that browser definitely has severe privacy issues
Android,not_removed,cool have fun and take care of it then
Android,not_removed,it can run games with amazing fidelity and huge post processing but the verge is a struggle that website is really bad isnt it
Android,not_removed,it would be nice if samsung browser opened tabs in the background
Android,not_removed,you can use ublock origin with mozilla firefox a little too much of a resource hog but it shouldnt matter on the latest samsung galaxy phones be a part of the open web
Android,not_removed,safe as in security
Android,not_removed,samsung browser use the servo engine
Android,not_removed,well except standards compliance
Android,not_removed,but how would you know theyve toned it down
Android,not_removed,thats what i figured yubrowser is pretty legit has stars in the play store and is developed by mokee open source which is a pretty reputable custom rom team i think the guy above may just be suffering from some xenophobia based on the name of the browser i agree that its a pretty bad name lol
Android,not_removed,thanks man btw hows the moto x i considered it but held off cause i dont trust lenovo to update it on time
Android,not_removed,lets just say it can bring some pcs to their knees
Android,not_removed,that and syncing passwords and accounts and ill stop using chrome entirely its honestly a stupid fast mobile browser
Android,not_removed,except firefox on android is not that great
Android,not_removed,he knows it will never happen
Android,not_removed,i got it last year and was fed up of the microstutters that plagues the ui on lollipop but on marshmallow its pretty smooth to be honest considering that i came from a lumia after using it for years i like this phone im planning to use it for another years updates are ok i suppose as i got marshmallow sometime middecemberish but security patches are lacking iirc last one was in mayjune i absolutely adore the battery life though lasts me around days with a shitty network dont get a good connection at my work its roughly edge or slow
Android,not_removed,this exchange is so nice and civilized it almost feels surreal
Android,not_removed,what extensions do you use i have ublock origin and https everywhere
Android,not_removed,it is good enough for me help make it better everyone being on webkitblink on mobile is very bad for the open web mozilla has already adopted quite a few webkit css vendor prefixes just feels like we are fighting against ie with a different name all over again
Android,not_removed,yeah i checked the address bar to make sure i was still on reddit edit no i didnt i just wanted to sound witty
Android,not_removed,they are official ambassadors for the platforms
Android,not_removed,hell of a writeup one question is the snapdragon the first processor to allow bluetooth also this could be the reason why samsung is rumored to keep a battery on the the and new amoled efficiencies could potentially give us a nice step up in battery life
Android,not_removed,exactly my thoughts i was waiting for a device to replace my compact now with delayed and possibly not a huge jump i wonder if i should just get a oneplus right now
Android,not_removed,man at this rate i might have to use this phone forever becomes mainstream next processor details will start leaking and this i will wait again for that new processor
Android,not_removed,it seems weird to me that samsung is talking all of the stock for the either this year there is no exynos chip or qualcomm is seriously underproducing the to which i would be inclined to think that qualcomm is underproducing only has one producer samsung who isnt producing enough as samsungs exynos huaweis kirin and apples axx line are the best mobile processor packages right now so why would samsung give that up which then begs the question what has qualcomm got up their sleeve that theyre not mass producing the so that its only in the to the extent of the which was in the htc etc slowly slides on tinfoil hat
Android,not_removed,the customerbeneficial gains of the over the given how phone manufacturers usually respond to changes in soc improvements are very likely to go unnoticed despite what the gains look like on paper most costumers couldnt even tell you what processor is in their phone shit a coworker of mine lost his phone last month and got a new one from his carrier it was an lg thats right not a but a
Android,not_removed,i can totally see this though its not really good for android that sammy is getting a massive jump start on the i can see why google wanted to make the pixel and advertise it to the masses android is quickly becoming the samsung os to the masses at least the high end masses with lg and moto struggling
Android,not_removed,yes but as a consumer who wants to save money and doesnt mind buying last years flagship specs i dont stand to gain anything because companies like oneplus dont have any incentive to lower or discount the prices of their phones
Android,not_removed,is touch latency still a problem with the considering buying one but the latency bothers me a bit
Android,not_removed,yes i believe it is i know it is bt certified but dont know if anyone will beat it to market which is still months away that being said i dont believe any sort of efficiency improvements from the processor will go into the devices themselves as long as android os android system and google play services are the top battery hogs and are uncontrollable
Android,not_removed,nope still want a big battery i keep bluetooth off unless im at the gym and pair my headphones so my battery isnt really effected by bluetooth on a normal day
Android,not_removed,its as good as a device as any battery life is stellar from all accounts good build quality and a more than acceptable camera i have a oneplus only i play around with once in a while and it a great great device software wise i love the system wide dark theme and the little touches here and there the only builds on these strengths
Android,not_removed,i dont have any complaints i was most concerned about reading on the pentile screen i spend usually an hour just reading ebooks before sleep but even that is fine its really fast nearstock android great battery life and feels premium and dash charging is so fast i dont have chargeanxiety anymore like not even a little bit xda has a kernel tweak for extra battery life and performance if they are to be believed but ive not rooted it yet if youre not the type to have cpuenvy just because something new comes out you could do much worse than a great phone
Android,not_removed,i did just that youll love the improved camera bigger screen and oxygen os experience
Android,not_removed,i went through the same did a brief stint on got disappointed by all android vendors on compact flagships so i picked up an iphone also have a corporate so i specifically wanted a smaller frame ruling out which i contemplated maybe fall brings something good
Android,not_removed,im also thinking about buying one my note is fine but the battery isnt the best i was thinking about getting a nokia but with the delays i dont know if itll launch with the or
Android,not_removed,i would
Android,not_removed,im really really trying to ditch this phone but at this rate im starting to think it will endure more than me
Android,not_removed,the circle of lifehaha
Android,not_removed,i am in the same boat
Android,not_removed,how is it holding up after a few years main reason why i upgraded was for the camera and battery life it charges in like under an hour but an hour of standby for my x takes up like of my battery plus the camera was pretty bad that i had trouble taking pictures of notes
Android,not_removed,is this processor octacore i dont want another i think quad core is the best
Android,not_removed,or since is and a new process qc is facing problems with low yields hopefully at start until they bang out the issues in mfg
Android,not_removed,qualcomm is a fabless company they dont manufacture anything samsung is producing the they may have secured a deal to use the chips first exclusively or it could be that since this is gen the initial yields may be lower this could mean that they simply cant produce as many as they want to right now
Android,not_removed,that made me feel slightly ill the amount of outdated phones these companies manage to push at original prices years later is disgraceful
Android,not_removed,that made me feel slightly ill the amount of outdated phones these companies manage to push at original prices years later is disgraceful
Android,not_removed,of course you can try and record a video on an iphone or a pixel try and mess with it one phone will shit itself full of artifacts you know for sure that that phone will be the one with the snapdragon device
Android,not_removed,android is quickly becoming the samsung os to the masses it already is and has been for a couple years now anyone whos not in the android enthusiast community so heavily associates android with samsung that most people will look at an android phone regardless of oem and say is that a samsung instead of is that an android google is already facing a major uphill battle to win that association in the minds of the publicaverage consumer back
Android,not_removed,well a year in soon and samsung still has one of the best phones ever made and they didnt exactly force anyone to make phones that all pretty much failed in one aspect or another and unless something like note happens its going to take some special effort to fail take slap grace on it refresh the specs to and start making money hand over fist so moto and others read some feedback dont try to copy samsung or apple and make a phone that holds up on paper if thats impossible then either cater to chinese or indians or start looking up other ventures
Android,not_removed,its fine some people who want to be anal as hell about things will bring it up i had my for months and never even noticed it it may be there but it wont ruin your experience i would guess
Android,not_removed,grace ux was pretty heavy handed with rogue apps the note had some pretty stellar battery life id say equivalent to the oneplus for what its worth
Android,not_removed,the systemwide dark theme is spoiling me seeing friends navigate bright white iphone menus in a dark car made me feel so lucky
Android,not_removed,the is back to an octacore setup
Android,not_removed,i understand this but then qualcomm could do what apple did with the and get two producers samsung and tsmc to me it just isnt making sense for them to go meh major flagships launches will use our processors processors when last year it was and that be okay with them there just be a piece of the story we are missing
Android,not_removed,ew ill take a pixel over by leaps and bounds sorry just hard for me to hear someone say that the is a best phone ever made so far from that for me so far
Android,not_removed,my pixel drains itself at least once a week rapidly due to android systemandroid os
Android,not_removed,that ive noticed in my
Android,not_removed,i think only samsung and intel have fab capabilities as of now and not sure intel has been contracted to build some of the correct me if im wrong
Android,not_removed,tsmc does not have ready at the moment intel has started to offer parties for arm but their license may be limited to vanilla arm cores and not custom ones like a arm architecture license allows
Android,not_removed,long as samsung is paying or making it worth qualcomms while theres no reason for them to say no to that deal that incentive is the fact that qualcomm needed samsungs help to produce the silicon samsung is doing it in exchange for timed exclusivity it really is that simple
Android,not_removed,processors dont use apostrophes when pluralizing sorry i think i have tiny stroke every time i read improperly apostrophes see what i did there
Android,not_removed,one of the best ever made and i will not disagree with them great build quality a camera that even now is amazingly good and its working well even after a year of rough use for most only exposure is the exynos so cant speak for ones heck with the newly rolled out nougat i can see most of my friends falling in love with it all over again
Android,not_removed,the tech is lacking on the pixel no expandable storage camera is pretty much equal with the even though they claimed it was going to be revolutionarythey both excel in different situations making them pretty much equal and there is no waterproofing the only advantage is software which is admittedly very good its also ugly as sin
Android,not_removed,android bundles alot of services in android system which is why it makes it seem like sucks up alot of battery though none of them have ever gone above for myself on avg android system uses while android os uses and google play service never goes above
Android,not_removed,what did it get with nougat
Android,not_removed,one of the best ever made describes basically all current flagships is very good but also very far from perfect
Android,not_removed,i dont care about looks and features i wont use nearly as much as i care about quality and usability they have nice displays though actually all of their hardware is very nice unfortunately if you cant write good software to run it it kind of goes to waste its like towing a foot trailer with a ferrari
Android,not_removed,yea so i guess im different the pixel holds up very well with water i dont need to go swimming with my phone for extended periods of time cant think of a reason why i need expandable storage with and it just happens that i absolutely can not stand samsung software so none of those other things are players anyway imho
Android,not_removed,same if i use bt all day thats usually the top drain after screen i guess bt will bring some good power savings i wonder if those savings will be realized without a bt headset i dont know about the rest of this sub but im not in favour of having to buy new peripherals just because the standard has been updated
Android,not_removed,a lot just as a reminder cause you wrote it two times wrong
Android,not_removed,this is a clickbait of a link and the gallery sucks but a brief overlook at the changes
Android,not_removed,i was jokingly responding to you saying ew i didnt mean it i really dont care
Android,not_removed,ew
Android,not_removed,youre not different youre rationalization man
Android,not_removed,ive seen the same thing with my this is very devicespecific thoughive had motorolas galaxies and iphones that dont have this problem
Android,not_removed,agreed ive been holding off buying anything bluetooth until peripherals are out
Android,not_removed,lmao its gboard auto correcting it 😒
Android,not_removed,ive owned samsung phones every single one of them with an unacceptable lifespan a terrible resale value and a software that seems to invent new ways to degrade despite updates its not a rationalization its a lesson learned i promised myself i would never do it again only to be sucked back one more time for the burnt again
Android,not_removed,i noticed this the other day and found it kind of annoying if youre not holding your phone you dont know if googles listening without looking at the screen this is particularly annoying when youre driving and have your phone mounted
Android,not_removed,at the bottom of the thread hi there thanks all for reporting this into the community forum the changes are an intended experimental feature that we are testing to improve the user experience and latency on voice search that being said we do welcome your feedback and appreciate your thoughts to help make our product better to submit your feedback to the product team directly please submit in product feedback at menu send feedback thanks cheers aj google search community manager
Android,not_removed,i got the beep to return by going into phone settings accessibility turn switch access on i agree its pretty dumb they removed it though edit it is known that this can cause some lag if used with accessibility apps such as lastpass so its probably not a good solution
Android,not_removed,i noticed that recently it would just vibrate instead of the usual bleeps google needs to catch up with amazon in this respect with the echo you say alexa play music in one sentence whereas google needs the keyword followed by a pause
Android,not_removed,just make it optional
Android,not_removed,there have been a few times i start talking after saying okay google and it misses my first few words because its busy beeping at me i was happy to see it removed on mine i could see it being frustrating if youre not holding your phone since you dont know if its picked you up or not but i cant think of a time where my phone would be sitting somewhere with the screen awake and turned on that i wouldnt be holding it aint nobody got the battery life for that
Android,not_removed,i thought it was broken for the last couple of weeks was planning on reflashing as i thought the audio file was corrupted saved me a job
Android,not_removed,the amount of times ive searched ok google after this change is astonishing
Android,not_removed,weird mine still beeps stock on nougat google version
Android,not_removed,has anyone else noticed that the recent update to the google search app leaves the results and query of your last search in the bar when you open it now i have to delete the last search before i can type in a new one
Android,not_removed,i found this really annoying at first but now i know its been intentionally removed and the benefits of its removal i get it and i actually like it better but google need to make people aware they cant just go removing features without telling anyone of it because people will think its a bug if theyre trying to push the pixels to the average consumer who doesnt read up on these things how the hell would they know
Android,not_removed,as part of the team who made this sound i am saddened by its death
Android,not_removed,is google intentionally moving backwards to see how far they can fuck shit up before people start abandoning their products i feel like im part of some sort of fucked up evil google social experiment their next experiment will probably be automatically posting random things you have searched to your google page
Android,not_removed,for the past couple weeks ok google has been popping up randomly when im not even talking its gotten annoying
Android,not_removed,i hope they remove it from android tv too because if you found it annoying on your phone well thats cute but then this happens on the tv blowing loudly on your sound bar now thats really annoying
Android,not_removed,this is typical of google to mess with features people are using and not even give indication of the change when i first bought my note it had always on google now i loved that feature then google promptly did an update that made it stop working and never fixed it at least as long as i owned that phone this is why i dont have much trust in google products they have this beta mentality about everything they release with little to no support and feature and products that can suddenly be changed or dropped completely without consideration to the vast number of users who my be using these features and products also this behavior by google puts android oems in a very bad position when a feature on the phone suddenly disappears without any warning due to googles lack of consideration for consumers using these features
Android,not_removed,whos the dumbass that thought this was a good idea why not give people the option
Android,not_removed,so its the old its not a bug its a feature defense
Android,not_removed,ive also noticed that google now has been spotty lately ill swipe left but it will tell me it cant be reached at the moment anyone else experiencing this
Android,not_removed,seams stupid voice commands are mostly used when you dont look on the phone
Android,not_removed,love this almost as much as i love how changes get made to the clockalarm but i dont notice them until my alarm goes off in the morning and im half asleep and dont understand what and of the new icons mean
Android,not_removed,good it was annoying
Android,not_removed,i noticed this but i noticed a more annoying feature me ok google text uwotton go ok send a message to uwotton using sms sure whats the message just return it to what it was before where it said sure whats the message
Android,not_removed,i noticed it still beeps when i have headphones plugged in but otherwise i get a quick vibrate i miss the beep
Android,not_removed,i havent had the little tone for a few days after seeing this post i check again and its there again im so confused whyd they remove it anyway
Android,not_removed,interesting i guess they did i think its more practical
Android,not_removed,how do i get rid of the zoom and burst buttons that are now on my camera i read i need to turn switch access off but i have toggled it many times clear app cache and data reboots and they still are there the only accessibility i have turned on is nova launcher and auto rotate it is driving me nuts
Android,not_removed,is this ymmv because i still get the tone
Android,not_removed,i think its to avoid the suggestion that you need to wait for it before giving your command pretty sure you dont
Android,not_removed,mine straight up doesnt even work anymore when charging i have to manually push the button at least now i know its not only my phone
Android,not_removed,shit i thought it was because i was on the dev prev on my lmao
Android,not_removed,i still get the auditory prompt im not convinced it was intentionally removed
Android,not_removed,this is weird i just tried it and heard the beep i live in asia
Android,not_removed,i noticed this as well and dont mind the removal of the tone what really bothers me is that previously google now would take from second to actually process my voice input and respond but ever since the tone was removed now it takes from seconds and its an annoyingly long pause
Android,not_removed,umm yeah we meant to do that
Android,not_removed,havent you guys ever heard of not fixing whats not broken god get with the times
Android,not_removed,thats annoying given how unreliable ok google is already on my nexus not sure if im really missing out the funny thing is i had high hopes for ok google always on with the oneplus one and i jumped on board so fast thinking life would be great instead on the opo the feature never really came unless you stuck to cos and even then was highly unreliable and barely usable when the came out i gladly jumped on board again because native support from google should be much better right nah it works sometimes and fails at other times i suspect the memory management on android is the responsible party as the serviceapp gets killed off sometimes
Android,not_removed,i use this command when i lost my phone somewhere in the room and then listen for the ping
Android,not_removed,i noticed this about a week ago and it was kind of jarring especially since ok google hotword detection didnt work all the time so i was uncertain if google really heard me ive since retrained by voice and i am thoroughly impressed with the latency decrease i can now ok google say wheres the bathroom in spanish and theres very little latency i ultimately love this changed
Android,not_removed,apparently its working for my android build google app version
Android,not_removed,i think if the plan on removing the tone then replace it with a greeting of some kind like alexa which says hello i believe which makes it more natural imo
Android,not_removed,i actually am super disappointed because i use ok google to find my phone all the time itll pick my voice all all over the house
Android,not_removed,no this sounds like such a stupid move to make
Android,not_removed,the tone was entirely too loud when youve been listening to a video or something prior and the multimedia volume is cranked unacceptably loud at times and i for one am glad it changed
Android,not_removed,this screws me in the car
Android,not_removed,fucking idiots
Android,not_removed,sowill apple remove it from siri too imo this is a mistake
Android,not_removed,this annoyed me i thought my phone was acting up hell i factory restored it just to try and fix it it either again till i updated google
Android,not_removed,praise jesus
Android,not_removed,really surprised people dont like this it was driving me nuts that i had to either wait for the beep before continuing talking or keep talking and have it beep over me now i can just talk straight to it ok google set a reminder to blah blah also it still has a queue if you happen to still be able to see the screen theres a circle that comes up in the top bar when its listening
Android,not_removed,if they could remove the ok google next i would be very happy its a fucking retarded phrase and users should be able to coin whatever activation phrase they want
Android,not_removed,my phone already has difficulty responding to my requests it straight up just doesnt work of the time and this is only making it worse i rely specifically on the auditory feedback in order to know when its ready for me to speak my query honestly this is what i hate about most about google the constant ab testing without making this a toggleable option makes for an extraordinarily frustrating experience edit i also use it to quickly find my phone when i cant remember where i set it down last
Android,not_removed,it is faster tho which was the reason for the change
Android,not_removed,i use the beep to find my phone ps my phone still beeps
Android,not_removed,it already inconvenienced me multiple times today i thought it was a glitch of some kind it actually put me in a bit of danger as i found myself looking at my phone while driving then fiddling with it to click the microphone button
Android,not_removed,the thing i dont like about that tone specifically when im driving is it plays from my phone then immediately plays over my speakers because its connected through bluetooth sometimes it throws me off and i have to start again
Android,not_removed,i hate it without the tone i dont know when its ready to listen to my commands cause theres always a delay
Android,not_removed,it seems to be back though mine was missing at first but has since returned
Android,not_removed,if you do not receive a command immediately after ok google triggers please play the beep after a determined amount of time best of both worlds when you are not looking at your phone it is quite annoying to get no feedback
Android,not_removed,thank you for your persistence
Android,not_removed,so its faster without the okay google beep
Android,not_removed,that email reads like they will ignore the feedback in the forum and only look at ones reported from the app probably not the case but why even bring it up since forums are also theirs
Android,not_removed,they should just make it optional whether or not people need the beep context isnt the point its whether people want it
Android,not_removed,that also gives you skip ten seconds aheadback buttons in the youtube app during videos
Android,not_removed,sadly no such option on my samsung phone running lollipop
Android,not_removed,echo and dot have a lot better microphones than any smartphones thats why the google home
Android,not_removed,a few people claim that they can do that with ok google but for me its not even close especially if you have another app open its really slow even on my brand spankin new ok google doink play music
Android,not_removed,interestingly you can say your entire command in one sentence on android wear which doesnt have an audio confirmingnits listening maybe google are leaning towards this approach
Android,not_removed,im hoping that that level of responsiveness comes with google assistant im guessing it requires something specific at the hardware level though
Android,not_removed,apparently you can do exactly that now
Android,not_removed,thats how responsive it is for me
Android,not_removed,whereas google needs the keyword followed by a pause not true you can just speak without pausing and it will work
Android,not_removed,strangely wear has always been able to do this in fact it works better without a pause
Android,not_removed,always on works all the time even if the screen is off
Android,not_removed,not only but it will also miss your fist few characters when typing in a search into the google app so annoying
Android,not_removed,no need to flash the audio file is part of the google search apk which is signed and verified via the play store corruption would mean your google app would not launch if a cacheunzipped file was corrupted just uninstallreinstall updates on that one app
Android,not_removed,happens a lot to me already sometimes the beep and screen lighting up is delayed but ive learned to just start talking if you are always waiting for the screen to light up and beep you can end up searching ok google quite frequently
Android,not_removed,seems like it might be a staggered rollout situation because mine also still beeps with the beta google app and stock nougat
Android,not_removed,same here
Android,not_removed,its buggy mine no longer beeps but when using a bluetooth headset it will itll also beep with certain accessibility services enabled
Android,not_removed,i also have this issue its sporadic though i also still have the tone after prompting ok google
Android,not_removed,i have not noticed this are you opening it fresh or pulling it up through recents
Android,not_removed,phone settings accessibility switch access
Android,not_removed,yup blank page of the time xperia x
Android,not_removed,thats important for people who do not have unlimited sms
Android,not_removed,if i am using bluetooth earpiece it is still there by itself i have no idea if it is ready
Android,not_removed,wouldnt that get in the way of their machine learning process
Android,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt mind them doing this if the phone actually hears you all of the time or if they brought back find my phone from the moto x which would turn a white screen on at max brightness and blast a very loud alert
Android,not_removed,if you go to settingsaccessibilityaccessibility services and then turn any one of them on the ok google sound will return hope this helps a bit
Android,not_removed,yeah why not just add a toggle
Android,not_removed,whoa i was wondering if it was just me i got so angry at my phone and it only started happening recently
Android,not_removed,oh this used to happen to me if you go to battery settings optimizing apps shishkebab then find google services or google now or something and set it to unoptimized it works better not any noticeable hit to batter
Android,not_removed,retrain the voice model in a quiet room
Android,not_removed,its not faster if it didnt hear the ok google and you have to say the entire command again ok google send a message to davey jones hi ill be there in about minutes buy me a pint silence
Android,not_removed,its a lot slower for me it seems like
Android,not_removed,does this have to do with androids audio latency problems also does anyone have a technical explanation of why the audio latency is so bad
Android,not_removed,this is how siri works if i am correct if you just say hey siri youll get the listening tone however you can also say hey siri followed by your command immediately in the same breathphrasesentence and shell work just fine
Android,not_removed,i wanted to yell stop breaking the apps you asshole and focus on hangout to make it better
Android,not_removed,yes try just saying the command immediately after ok google works right away
Android,not_removed,but it makes it so you have to click an x to make the overlay disappear instead of just tapping anywhere
Android,not_removed,google home actually which is a bit disappointing i think they are relying on their superior voice recognition to make up for it which would allow them to sell at a lower price point
Android,not_removed,you apparently dont have to wait for the beep
Android,not_removed,thats the thing if get the beep you dont have the updated google app
Android,not_removed,i have a nexus i gave it a try i said okay google play music from kanye west with no pause it worked perfectly surprisingly phone was locked and sitting about foot from my face though not sure itd work so smoothly i just tried it with the weather and it worked also
Android,not_removed,the obvious for me would be to be able to accept one long instruction but if it didnt get it prompt with a noise or sir similar to the existing beep particularly if they are going towards a conversational model of an assistant it would make more sense to not have the stilted now structure
Android,not_removed,i dont know that i can do always on on my phone my screen has to be on i think at least i cant find an option for always on i guess that would strengthen the case for frustration certainly
Android,not_removed,this is an option on my nexus that used to work and since nougat has stopped working it will work then some time during the day ill go say ok google and my phone wont do anything i have to reboot my phone to get it to work with the screen off again and then after a certain amount of time it will just break again really annoying kinda defeats the whole purpose of the feature
Android,not_removed,im hitting the g icon on the pixel launcher takes the place of the old search widget maybe its an issue with the leaked apk of the launcher
Android,not_removed,i assume youre making a joke based on lack of users that said even if g had the userbase that fb has it would still be accurate g doesnt give a false sense of security and gives you a ton of control on groups and who you are sharing shit with
Android,not_removed,this isnt there for samsung phones
Android,not_removed,you can say send a hangouts message if you dont want sms i dont know if any other messaging services are supported
Android,not_removed,text without any other context is synonymous with sms
Android,not_removed,i agree but let me turn it off they have a similar option where you can turn onoff voice prompts when over hands free or none but nothing for verbatim or quick prompts when not using any sort of accessory with the above mentioned thing off its the whole sentence
Android,not_removed,i dont see how they could have you train a model for the activation phrase like how you train it to recognize the sound of your voice
Android,not_removed,naw just replace the static phrase with a user defined variable im getting real tired of everyones phone in the house responding to the same activation phrase
Android,not_removed,dude just type find my phone into any google you are signed in to
Android,not_removed,shouting ok google timer in one second works well if you didnt lower the alarm volume
Android,not_removed,this does not work for
Android,not_removed,i do this sometimes but if im more than a few feet away from it it wont understand my query at all weirdly i can say ok google from almost any distance and it activates correctly
Android,not_removed,doesnt work if yiu have a screen lock it wont tell you the time until you unlock the phone
Android,not_removed,it asks me to retrain it at least once a week so i dodoesnt help
Android,not_removed,exactly and its not as though the delay between activation and the beep is consistent because it isnt thats why that beep is important
Android,not_removed,say ok google and then start saying your command i dont have to wait at all any more
Android,not_removed,but this is just a retraining issue on the part of the user new users to the product will have a much improved experience and existing users will adapt fairly quickly as someone who uses both iphones and androids quite often it is so much more natural to say hey siri set a timer for minutes than it is to say ok google wait for beepbeep set a timer for minutes it seems like a minor change but the instant aspect makes a world of difference ok google cant get to that level if they and their users are reliant on the beep
Android,not_removed,looks like im the one who needs retraining ive tried a bunch of voice commands just saying ok google and going straight into the command and its worked perfectly every time interestingly my phone still has the beep since it looks like theyre just testing without the beep and i can do the same thing i say ok google and just keep on talking right over the beep it still catches everything i say
Android,not_removed,do you feel like youd be able to quickly get used to the new implementation though since doing the voice training on mine it hasnt failed to start up even a single time so i feel confident that once i say okay google that its listening and ready
Android,not_removed,wow youre right im still not quite sure of the timing
Android,not_removed,lol have done that many times
Android,not_removed,dude whoa calm the wait no ill yell with you
Android,not_removed,focus on hangouts focus on burying it deeper in its grave
Android,not_removed,even with the beep you can speak without any pauses i still have the beep on my and it works just fine
Android,not_removed,woah til that doesnt happen too often anymore with respect to my own phones
Android,not_removed,o thats why that was happening god damn it i cant win against googles design decisions
Android,not_removed,google defintely has better voice recognition
Android,not_removed,hopefully theyre really good mics
Android,not_removed,why not wait and rush into conclusions because you only see two holes for mics
Android,not_removed,ive tried without it i do
Android,not_removed,it must be server side im in the beta and am on latest and still have the beep edit just got the update still beeping trying a reboot still beeps after reboot may still be a server side switch
Android,not_removed,it tends to work really well once the google app is opened if you use google now launcher it probably would be very responsive but i use nova and there are times it takes like seconds for the app to even start
Android,not_removed,i have it turned on on my phone but it works like of the time
Android,not_removed,i believe always on listening only works for the most recent nexus devices
Android,not_removed,i had the same problem for a long time and it was pretty irritating i got it to work every time by turning off battery optimization for google app in the battery settings settings battery google app battery optimization dont optimize if you dont see it in the battery list click the overflow menu in the top right and click battery optimization and find google app in there now the only problem i have is when the phone is sideways and the screen is off ok google will wake the screen up and ill watch google go from portrait to landscape and it stops listening once it flips to landscape super annoying
Android,not_removed,i have this same issue using action launcher havent found a way to fix it other than a reboot and it seems random
Android,not_removed,lol
Android,not_removed,most people do not know that mont people dont know what sms means
Android,not_removed,it absolutely is for people who know what sms is you have to remember that we are a circle of tech enthusiasts my dad has no idea what sms means and if he was on a limited plan it saying that could help him make a connection
Android,not_removed,in the us yes but not in areas where no one even uses sms to begin with
Android,not_removed,what about google home which device should be activated perhaps a combination of both i could say ok phone or ok tablet and it wouldnt activate my wifes devices but either of us could say ok home and it would respond to both of us
Android,not_removed,well i figure they run tons of ok google queries through their learning process so they can improve detection for that specific phrase
Android,not_removed,wouldnt that get in the way of their machine learning process
Android,not_removed,yeah why just say a couple of words out loud when instead you can go to another device type a query and send a message across the internet progress
Android,not_removed,til
Android,not_removed,not as convenient
Android,not_removed,well i have this nova launcher option and turning it on doesnt affect anything so thats the one i did
Android,not_removed,do you have twilight its pretty innocuous
Android,not_removed,try switch access works for me
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,because your phone is always expecting to hear those two words they literally have a chip exclusively listening for that verbal queue which is not the case for any other words
Android,not_removed,you mean in settings i just ignore that i dismissed the notification
Android,not_removed,i have no delay whatsoever now i say ok google set a timer for minutes in a perfectly normal speaking voice with no artificial pause and it sets the timer i was really annoyed at first because i thought losing the beep meant i wouldnt know if it was ready now i think its great because i dont need to wait at all for it to be ready
Android,not_removed,i still have to wait or it misses my command nexus
Android,not_removed,even with the beep i dont think you had to wait i would just say ok google set a timer it would beep after a second or so but the command would all be there you can actually hear all your ok google history somewhere it records a bit before and after
Android,not_removed,it relies heavily on network connection if you have a fast phone and a strong network connection its instantaneous from the sound of one comment it seems like the update made it so its a little more forgiving with the network latency allowing your phone to hear your entire command even without network connection instead of only hearing your command if a network connection is present
Android,not_removed,not here
Android,not_removed,the problem before was that you would say ok google and it would heard you correctly but there was a delay in getting the app to a point where it was ready for your request you didnt need the beep to know if it was ready you needed the beep to know when it was ready now its instantaneous for me though i dont have to pause at all after saying ok google that makes the beep unnecessary
Android,not_removed,how would i its not about whether it recognized my voice in general its to let me know the moment from which it starts to record audio without the beep i no longer know
Android,not_removed,that may be why they removed it people think they need to wait for the beep which never happens immediately this sort of makes it feel slow
Android,not_removed,i only use it to call someone or send a quick text in the car its easier to just type out things i need to search for
Android,not_removed,does it i get that google now is incredibly accurate but my amazon echo is also incredibly accurate and part of that is definitely due to the better mics as it can hear me over my tv for instance
Android,not_removed,adding more microphones isnt about improving quality so much as selectivity you have have the best most noiseimmune voice recognition in the world but with only one mic you cant separate two people talking
Android,not_removed,here at randroid we cast judgement on devices before theyre announced
Android,not_removed,just came back to say
Android,not_removed,its hardly a leap theres almost certainly only mics
Android,not_removed,do you have switch access turned on in accessibility
Android,not_removed,i use nova as well
Android,not_removed,same here nexus user the feature sounded so cool which was why i shelled out for this phone master race but one of the most important features as a frequent traveler on the road fails me like half the time
Android,not_removed,that would be really frustrating i get why this change would be annoying to you
Android,not_removed,oh that would explain it then i got excited about it there are tons of times i would use that stupid htc
Android,not_removed,not necessarily just the nexus devices itll work on any device that has the hardware to support it a special low power microphone for example the lg and the new both support the always listening feature
Android,not_removed,worked on my sony compact but yeah it also works on my nexus ive recently realized if im not in a crazy loud environment i can simply ok google while its in my pocket and it works rather well
Android,not_removed,no offense to you but i feel like every time someone suggests disabling battery optimization i wonder if thats really the reason the thing is your phone should only be dozing when its not moving anyway so unless youre doing an ok google after your phone sits for hours on a table it should be working most of the time people want it to i also suspect most people reporting failures arent encountering cases where their phone is still dozing i also highly doubt having to toggle that is the real fix otherwise google wouldve exempted the app like it does with play services and android wear if they wanted ok google not to have issues what i suspect is android memory management sometimes kills off the google app processservice much like the way you get launcher redraws
Android,not_removed,im not sure i understand why youd want to keep it secret like that youd have to upload it once per individual its definitely easier to set up circles than it is set up custom lists on facebook
Android,not_removed,because then you will be sure your phone will ring even if its in another room and cant hear your voice
Android,not_removed,same though im back to nexus launcher now ive disabled novas one however i have tasker and go extender on both relatively silent
Android,not_removed,android development preview us with nexus are stuck with it at the moment
Android,not_removed,toaster sofa doorknobs
Android,not_removed,you told me to retrain it but im saying i do retrain it every time it prompts me to
Android,not_removed,the delay is very random if you have a crappy internet connection
Android,not_removed,i like it way better only thing i would have hated was on my nexus the vibration is way to strong but with a custom kernel i turned it down
Android,not_removed,my nexus ok google might beep instantly or take a whole three to four seconds to do so
Android,not_removed,wow youre right actually i thought mine was slower but i just tried what you said and its actually picking up on the voice recognition before the screen comes on and animation starts playing
Android,not_removed,i have to wait or it only gets the last word of my command nexus
Android,not_removed,just tried it on my and works surprisingly well
Android,not_removed,no sometimes its just delayed the app takes a second to launch and beep but it starts recording already what i have a lot is i say ok google and the app starts recording and when i finally see the screen flash to show the search screen its already listening and then i get the whole i didnt get what you were trying to say or whatever they say when they cant pick up input or theres also ok google waits for app to launch ok google and then it does a search for ok google
Android,not_removed,without the beep i no longer know you know its as soon as youre done saying okay google thats the point of removing the beep it just starts picking it up right away
Android,not_removed,thats true i only had the vibrate replace the ring once i wiped my phone to change roms and it hasnt come back does it vibrate faster than it ringed also now you cant tell its listening if youre not holding your phone so its productive but also counterproductive depending on when and how youre using it
Android,not_removed,better mics sure but not better voice recognition ive used both the echo and my phone side by side and google now got it right much more of the time google has put sooo much into their voice rocgnition they better be ahead of amazon
Android,not_removed,demonstration of an algorithm that easily differentiates between two sound sources given two mics
Android,not_removed,oh yeah more mics is definitely better at least it has two so that way it can discern between the sources of noise better
Android,not_removed,true but have you seen how googles nexus devices have been in regards to microphones the nexus has dual mics and yet cant even do a hangouts group call because the back mic is the one used to pick up voice i end up using my ipad instead yes that ancient device the nexus has horrible feedback both my friend and i have tried with our i end up using a headset or my work iphone when i have hangout chats so maybe mics can work well if you set it up properly but the fact that google doesnt even set up their devices properly angers me so really i dont know what to expect with google home
Android,not_removed,hardly a leap just from an stock photo yeah
Android,not_removed,the only service i have enabled is automagisk
Android,not_removed,yeah but im not too upset because they added a small vibration when it detects the hotwordbut thats only good when its in your hand or a place quiet enough to hear the vibration
Android,not_removed,its not just the hardware they need to license the usage from qualcomm the nexus had it snapdragon and later have the hardware capability but google never enabled it so its really a devicebydevice case basis iirc the note had hey galaxy always on listening with the snapdragon
Android,not_removed,im just mentioning what actually worked for me what you mentioned about sitting for hours on a table is the exact use case for me if my phone is sitting on my desk at work or home it will just sit there not being used because im using my computers for everything that was the only situation where ok google would stop working it always worked if the screen was only off for just a few minutes just not for extended periods and that was what led me to the battery i have never had a problem since flipping that switch and its a problem i remember happening shortly after i got my all the way up to about last monthish when i turned off optimization for it
Android,not_removed,if im close enough to hear my phone ringing it can probably hear me yelling maybe if youre not sure which wing of your mansion you left it in you can turn on the ringer and hone in on it by sound but for those everyday moments where im not sure if i set my phone down in the kitchen or left it in the living room i dont have to look around for it i can just immediately shout okay google and hear the beep from wherever im at its super convenient and i do it about once a day if i have to go sit down at my desktop or open up my laptop fire up a browser search for find my phone potentially resign into my google account to be able to use the tracker which it made me do for security reasons when i tried it just now and click a buttonthats way less convenient and im not going to do it regularly dont get me wrong the android device manager which is what comes up when you search find my phone has its place and is super useful if your phone is stolen or if you think you lost it outside your house but it doesnt fill the same role as the simple hey where are you call and response
Android,not_removed,works great if im at home near my laptop not so much if im literally anywhere else
Android,not_removed,ah okay i couldnt remember the last dp release before i got the official release on the i didnt realize the final hasnt been pushed to the yet
Android,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlrqsauqdec
Android,not_removed,do you have your phone on autorotate those are the two big reasons for okay google not working correctly sometimes you need to actually delete the voice model and start fresh as well
Android,not_removed,with this new implementation it seems fine even if you have no internet connection at all i just tried it in airplane mode and as long as i give it about second after saying ok google it seems to work for example if i say ok google set a timer for minutes it sets a timer even while offline if i say ok google what temperature is it outside it recognizes the question correctly but it cant answer because there is no network obviously thats an issue but its a separate issue since we are talking about a delay before being able to ask the question and it is able to hear the question fine
Android,not_removed,you know its as soon as youre done saying okay google not if it doesnt pick up you saying okay google
Android,not_removed,mine doesnt i have to wait for a vibration from the phone about as long as the tone would have taken otherwise it only gets the second half of my sentence nexus
Android,not_removed,no its not thats the theory and i reckon in ideal situations thats what happens but not always because the phone is busy memory had to be cleared etc hence the beep rather useful feature that
Android,not_removed,so why does it vibrate isnt that just wasting battery
Android,not_removed,sure you can do a bit with as long as the voices arent in frontbehind but is way better
Android,not_removed,from a stock photo that shows two microphone holes
Android,not_removed,i have two step auth for my google account if i cant find my phone how am i supposed to find my phone
Android,not_removed,stop setting your phone down in unusual places
Android,not_removed,i have orientation locked to portrait mode of the time ill try deleting and retraining the voice model but frankly i think the mic on this thing just sucks it might be faulty
Android,not_removed,thats weird and dumb if its not faster then whats the point i wonder
Android,not_removed,that doesnt show the rest of the body or the internals
Android,not_removed,dont you have backups set for your
Android,not_removed,hrm an acquaintance of mine has a ill have to see how his works for him
Android,not_removed,no clue perhaps im bugged or perhaps its imperceptibly faster im just bummed that i cant talk to it from across the room with the screen off i cant always hear the vibration it now makes at that distance
Android,not_removed,why would there be extra microphones on the back or sealed inside
Android,not_removed,its ok ive had my fill of this phone im planning on getting a pixel when theyre announced
Android,not_removed,i just checked mine again and mine vibrates as well however i just said out a sentence okay google text kristin how are you without giving any space in between and it picked up the whole thing even though i didnt wait for the buzz
Android,not_removed,woohoo
Android,not_removed,ayy its ya boy tim schofield back with another video on a serious note that design is pretty slick normally only like black or white phones but the blue is nice
Android,not_removed,im pretty torn i wish this phone were or even without the back or coupon i may wait for it to go down or to get a software update tim made some good points about what can be annoying with the emui i have a nexus and i really truly hate the size even though i used to like it i would get the axon but i am so tired of the earphone jack on the top ive been running and working out to lose weight and id love a smaller phone a phone with a bottom headphone jack gotta hold out a bit more
Android,not_removed,good review thanks tim i was looking at this phone for the specs and am glad i didnt get it that custom chip will probably make it difficult for devs to make other roms for this to fix the problems that huawei made with their customizations
Android,not_removed,this may be a very dumb question but will the honor work on verizon i try to keep up to date on the latest devices coming out but cant seem to understand how to tell if a phone will work on a network i dont know if this is against the rules but ive been rocking at note for the last years and am looking to upgrade this fall i am tired of samsung and think i want to move on towards an unlocked device should i wait for the new devices nexus or go with something like the honor thanks in advance for your input
Android,not_removed,not sure why you would buy this over a axon etc besides the size the gpu is yes worse than the gpu of an so at the crushes it in games the axon has a literally says so in amoled screen amazing dac and speakers etc yes all of the phones at have some issue or flaw but to me the honor shouldnt be anywhere above as the axon which is much better all around was being preordered for bh giftcard headphones i have no bias against honorhuawei just that if they want people to buy their devices they have to either cut the price or add on the features
Android,not_removed,this phone is a major major go flossy carter tim schofield michael scott
Android,not_removed,why does it matter it might not be but its widely available so you can get it tax free and free shipping at newegg and get back as a gift card and a pair of bluetooth jbl headphones and they were also throwing in a case before so it costs a lot less than other supposedly phones the oneplus is realistically more than this phone after you take into account the shipping costs that youre forced to pay and buying a case let alone the free headphones
Android,not_removed,i went from a to a will never look back is plenty big enough and isnt a nuisance in the pockets
Android,not_removed,i also keep thinking why is the headphone jack in the top they should switch the usb and headphone jack
Android,not_removed,honor only works on gsm carriers the axon is fully compatible with both gsm and cdma so it should work on verizon for you i cant remember if the works on cdma but im inclined to say it doesnt
Android,not_removed,sd card and higher pixel density vs the smaller size than both available from amazonbestbuy and should have better battery life with a much more efficient soc also has an ir blaster which is one of many reason why i am getting it
Android,not_removed,personally i dont play mobile games and i dont want a phablet so devices like the honor become more or less my only option at this price point if i want something new im just trying to decide if i can live with emuis notifications scheme
Android,not_removed,indeed the gpu is worse but talk about a faster and more efficient cpu with the kirin and maybe some people are more into compact phones then having a brick in your pocket and how fast do people forget amoled burn in issues the fact that honor guaranteed updates for years compared to zte a company which is not able to communicated with the european market offering different services and software features to customers from the us compared to eu and do not ignore the fact that you can buy a honor from amazon and in case of a problem you just have to deal with friendly amazon compared to the shaddy support desk of oneplus price wise the axon costs € and there is no deal available in europe for any goods or giftcards meanwhilethe honor € with a free amazon fire stick worth € just my cents
Android,not_removed,most people dont think that way like randroid does they see that it looks nice and thats about it and lets face it phones are essentially the same for most people as long as it works as intended sms calling other people whatsapp webbrowsing and watching youtube videos most will be happy with it they dont care if it has a display instead of a one and they most certainly understand the differences between the cpus
Android,not_removed,ive heard several people mention issues with spotty reception on the axon a problem also shared by the inherent to all metal unibody designs unfortunately none of the comparison reviews mention call quality or lte reception so i have no idea if the glass backed honor which theoretically should be better is actually better in real life
Android,not_removed,so at the crushes it in games the amount i care about gaming on my phone is exactly amazing dac and speakers having a high end dac is nice i love my for that but speakers dont concern me at all and realistically i hardly ever am using headphones with my phone so the dac is not a big enough priority over other things axon which is much better all around all the reviews ive seen of axon show the camera being significantly worse than the and honor while most reviews of the show its camera trading blows with the for stills at least not sure why you would buy this over a axon etc besides the size for some of us the size is a huge factor im shopping for my so and she absolutely does not like large phones if this phone was then it would be a much tougher choice between it and the but the makes it a lot more appealing for her so at this point my decision is between a used or the honor also the gesture and shortcut support on the fingerprint sensor smart key is really awesome and legitimately useful in daily usage scenarios and the and axon do not have anything like that
Android,not_removed,i bought the didnt pay any shipping
Android,not_removed,stupid question but why do you prefer it on the bottom i have no preference either way im just curious
Android,not_removed,axon has the bands for verizon and sprint but not support from the carriers themselves so no volte the doesnt have cdma bands
Android,not_removed,ps the htc is a perfect representation of that
Android,not_removed,ppi doesnt translate to how the screen performs in color accuracy saturation or brightness
Android,not_removed,the real world comparisons seem to put the honor with similar battery life as the and axon despite the kirin being more efficient maybe the emui is the culprit the axon is sold by both stores too but oos due to demand honestly besides the ir and size the axon has you you can buy wifi to ir bridges if you only use ir in one room and supposedly you can get ir blasters too either way hope you enjoy it when you get it
Android,not_removed,im just trying to decide if i can live with emuis notifications scheme not sure if youve seen this yet but there is an option you can set where swiping down from the left side of the screen shows notifications while swiping down from the right side shows quick actions but afaik theres no fix for the cutoff issue with expandable notifications i also hadnt heard of the lockscreen issue with notifications until seeing this video even though i feel like ive seen every other video review there is on the
Android,not_removed,same here gaming on my just broke the digitizer on my looks like you have the same phone so moving on i think the notification issue is that you cant dismiss it from the lock screen or that it lives on two tabs in the pull down menu
Android,not_removed,its ok at best really hope they bring a unified center in emu
Android,not_removed,the worse gpu is it based on benchmarks because all of the real time gaming performance in the videos seem great would it be a major bottleneck in the future i read somewhere that with the vulcan api the gui will be ported over to the gpu would this mean the honor will fall behind the in smoothness
Android,not_removed,honor guaranteed updates but not android os updates big difference yes zte seems to be doing weird stuff with euglobal since they are behind on updatessecurity patches but on the other hand they arent bundling bloatware and spyware truecaller on your phone as for onepluss support ymmv ive had shit support from samsung before and some people have priased onepluss support so who the fuck knows
Android,not_removed,but those people buy samsung apple or whatever model the salesperson at the store is pushing for their price point i only made those comments for randroid users not the whole population as we know nexus op zte honor whatever devices are not what the normal public buys
Android,not_removed,for tweakers axon for audiophiles honor for everyone else cause its pretty
Android,not_removed,pocketnows reviews of the honor and axon test that juan specifically shows the signal of the axon next to the honor
Android,not_removed,if youre looking for used check out best buy they have refurbished verizon for i have one being delivered today
Android,not_removed,personally its because its natural to put my phone in the pockets with the top part facing down its easier to do so because the gesture to take the phone from talking position to pocket is quite natural and doesnt strain your wrists when i get my nexus jack on the top from the pocket it feels unnatural i get it and i have to use my other hand to turn it to talking position which is uncomfortable and requires me to have both hands free well its a personal opinion nonetheless so it might be different for others
Android,not_removed,yeap one reason why i have a right now ir blaster is mandatory now for me
Android,not_removed,the doesnt include an ir blaster and i have both the htc is something i dont look going back to compared to my other phones as the reception quality is the biggest pita ive dealt with in a long time
Android,not_removed,the real world comparisons seem to put the honor with similar battery life as the and axon despite the kirin being more efficient maybe the emui is the culprit i have a lite with kirin their midrange cpu and mah battery on emui the battery life is great so i wouldt blame the emui if anything emui has pretty tough memory and app management in order to extend battery life with screen honor should beat them but the competition has amoleds which are more efficient screens might be thats whats tying them in battery life department
Android,not_removed,i am aware of the competition and i had a on launch day sold to do worker axon is not a phone i will ever get due to the camera is a good phone though i just sold my mate and regularly got hours sot the honor i would expect to get was right below that in normal use though which is still damn good compared to the crappy life i got on my
Android,not_removed,the lock screen part is mildly irritating the two tabs part im whatever on its the timeline layout that kinda bothers me
Android,not_removed,the emui leak i saw on xda looks really promising which is tipping me towards just getting the damn phone
Android,not_removed,i just dont see all these people running around playing games on their phonesmust be just me though using it like a very reclusive business person when i think of video games i think of console and pc gaming not jumping on my phone and going dude why the fuck isnt this mobile phone running in uhd yet this thing is totally not worth yes this is an exaggeration and quite possibly true as well it just sucks because it seems more and more apparent that each phone that comes out has some minor flaw that gets blown out of proportion and then everyone online blasts the company because it didnt include their pokemon go preinstalled or something stupid we judge phones now not for what they bring but for what they lack cant imagine obama having to use that old ass while watching all these new future phones running around
Android,not_removed,at i doubt it will see any real issues will kill it no matter what though it is just more powerful the kirin does not throttle much though compared to every other processor on android phones
Android,not_removed,thats true
Android,not_removed,you say that until the lcd fails and responds with tough shit also was supposed to bring the audiophile thing in and bombed on the speaker front axon is definitely the hottest thing
Android,not_removed,thats awesome ill check it out right away
Android,not_removed,and they should be unlocked for use on tmobile and att though they may not have all the bands needed for lte but im not sure
Android,not_removed,huh didnt realize best buy had any refurbs at good prices like that might check it out however i am trying to get an exynos version if possible for that extra battery life
Android,not_removed,same here it feels much more natural to put the phone in my pocket upside down rather than having to turn it degrees first
Android,not_removed,only the xda review shows poor battery life everyone else has reported it being good no reason it should be any different than the
Android,not_removed,axon is not a phone i will ever get due to the camera really surprised that so many people seem to be missing this key difference from reviews the axon camera looked great on paper but in practice it seems to fall pretty short of the
Android,not_removed,i couldnt hold out any longer got it in white today from newegg great phone as expected its a mini mate with a better camera i wanted a black but who knows when that is coming performance is stellar size feels damn small even compared to my screen is nice and even unlike the bleed in two areas up top speaker is loud and passible for mono installed a n themed hwt from xda to get rid of the terrible icons from huawei ir blaster works great synced up with my philipslgmitsubishi tvs on the first try the jbl headphones from newegg dont seem half bad either they are recharging now for a better test tomorrow
Android,not_removed,when i buy a phone i tend to keep it for a minimum of years barring any unfortunate mishaps rip my og moto x so when the gpu in this phone is supposedly worse than something in the same price range you can see how thats a cause for concern for me and really i dont play those full fledged games on my mobile either but i was under the impression right or wrong that the gpu will be more important for gui in future android versions and seeing as how i hope to keep using this phone for a couple of yearsi hope you see where im coming from
Android,not_removed,let me know if you find a exynos version for a similar price and ill return the best buy one id also much prefer exynos
Android,not_removed,is the bluetooth connection stable some reviews said otherwise
Android,not_removed,yeah i can see what you mean although i guess if youre going down this path and dont mind used phones android phones have the largest loss in price value only a year from release date the is definitely affordable at this point
Android,not_removed,well i found one guy on craigslist supposedly selling the exynos version of the for and an for but i havent met up with him to confirm if its real or not he did actually respond to my emails though unlike those fake scam emails you see where they have it spelled out like myusername at gmail dot com plus thats not useful to you unless you live in co lol
Android,not_removed,so far so good but ive only had it connected to a pebble time for a few hours
Android,not_removed,havent had a chance to test out the headphones yet haha
Android,not_removed,did but i had them wired to test the headphone port havent connected through bt yet

Android,not_removed,img titleinsert something thats probably what it sees edit its alt not title
Android,not_removed,oh ok
Android,not_removed,oh youre right the title is only for normal elements i forgot
Android,not_removed,second difference not bad considering the price difference
Android,not_removed,let me guessiphone wins apple doesnt need to make new phonethey still have the fastest phone in the market i am really mad that android manufacturers dont use fastest storage availablepeople are for god sake i dont want your iris scanner and modules thank you
Android,not_removed,the iphone is really fast if apple made animations shorter it wouldve been an even bigger gap that said though i still prefer android and its features id rather sacrifice couple of seconds and have a phone that does more
Android,not_removed,if we ignored the video rendering that kept the oneplus behind then i think the oneplus keeps up well in overall ui performance even if we factor in the penalty the difference between the two phones was a mere seconds thats telling
Android,not_removed,im honestly surprised to see some compliments towards apple here for making a good phone bravo fellow android fans you give me hope that one day ios and android users can live together in harmony d
Android,not_removed,finally we have an android phone which can compete with iphone
Android,not_removed,whats the point of these videos is a few seconds difference in how fast apps open supposed to be what you base your purchase on or what
Android,not_removed,iphone won cuz crazy fast nvme storage metal api on games cant wait for vulcan though once developers starrt using them we should see closer results
Android,not_removed,they should retest both these phones after apple releases a new phone os i bet the loses after they deliberately slow it down to encourage users to upgrade
Android,not_removed,the should be jailbroken with animations off same for turn them off in dev settings
Android,not_removed,so many things wrong with this video ios vs android custom soc vs off the shelf soc resolution differencesi hate these kinds of click bait videos before you flame i use a nexus and iphone plus
Android,not_removed,comparison between iphone and android arent exactly fair its possible that iphone app is better optimised than the android equivalent app for the comparison to be on equal grounds boths phones should be running same os when its android vs any other other android i am ready to accept the result
Android,not_removed,the is a truly amazing device given the price range but its sad to see android flagships are or more behind in the same test considering the price difference
Android,not_removed,not bad considering the price difference but very bad from an overall pov
Android,not_removed,what about the
Android,not_removed,the processor is fast but not that much faster than current android flagship cpus the huge speed difference is due to the super fast nvme flash storage i went from an data drive on my xps to a nvme drive and my read speeds went from to
Android,not_removed,well if rumors are true the note will have dual lane ufs which should be faster than the stuff apple is currently using
Android,not_removed,yea man apples socs own im always impressed with how well android phones can compete when apples socs are sometimes as much as faster
Android,not_removed,another factor to consider probably because is running at pixels thus less pixels to renderprocessless ram usage lets say the is a screen pixels pixels
Android,not_removed,they should retest both these phones after apple releases a new phone os i bet the loses after they deliberately slow it down to encourage users to upgrade
Android,not_removed,that is what bothers you that the device needs to go into the garbage after two years because no updates should be higher on the list also android is not only built to serve you you are just the idiot who gives google all your data that will be analyzed for advertisement but this point is moot in direct comparison ios is built to lock you down in every possible way pick whatever antifeature you like more
Android,not_removed,animations will be faster in
Android,not_removed,whats telling exactly that a year old phone is still beating the newest androids
Android,not_removed,apple has the best engineering in the world i dont know any reasonable person who doubts this
Android,not_removed,as a fan of freedom and open source i dont like ios or by extension the iphone but i have to admit that its impressive that they have managed to generally stay ahead on performance for years now that doesnt bother me at all if apple can beat everybody else its not because everybody else suck apple just makes a damn good phone for everybody else to match and just when it seems like further progress wont make much difference anymore it continues to be relevant because it makes new uses possible
Android,not_removed,im honestly surprised to see some compliments towards apple here you clearly havent been around long
Android,not_removed,aaaaaaaand heres the iphone
Android,not_removed,the seconds are there every time you are using the phone so during a two year period its quite a long time the waiting times get bigger too so this only gets worse its a very small thing to worry about seconds in this case but time is a very precious thing now that i think about it why am i even replying d jk
Android,not_removed,the point is just to find which one is faster not necessarily better everyone has different weights for different objectives when considering a phone if you dont think second difference is that important you wouldnt give it a big weight and thus wont affect your decision but for someone who values speed it may be deciding factor these tests are just for reference and you cant apply your standards on someone else
Android,not_removed,exactly the opposite there was only a tiny difference between these two phones the headline of the video is if you are looking for a very fast phone the iphone and oneplus are almost identical in that regard alternatively if you are trying to choose between an iphone and base your decision on other factors like sizecamerabattery lifeprice every result and comparison provides useful information whether the difference is great or small
Android,not_removed,all i want out of a phone is a fast snappy ui battery life and camera are secondary to user experience
Android,not_removed,no it would take me all day to open this many secondshell minutes means nothing
Android,not_removed,thank you wanted to write the same thing slow news day i guess
Android,not_removed,its a fun way of comparing phones better than that synthetic benchmarks at least
Android,not_removed,hardly fair as you can turn off animations without any modifications to the even though you dont really need to
Android,not_removed,youre a getting downvoted because the point of this video is not showing how ios and android work but which would be the fastest device in a daily situation normal people and even techy people dont care about how they work they care about how they perform and this video shows that an old year iphone still performs better than an android phone with the best specs avaliable
Android,not_removed,but when the purpose is to measure speed the ios argument is invalid it doesnt matter what kind of black magic the oems put in their devices if they want to find out which one is faster then this test serves perfectly fine you cannot dismiss a gold medal of an athlete just because hes from a different country than the runner up and doesnt have the same training methods
Android,not_removed,im a tech fan i think both phones have good things about them i think most android phones suck in general though im not sure people would disagree at any given time there is acceptable phones for android everything else is trash
Android,not_removed,wtf is up with all these people talking about how optimized ios is what is that even supposed to mean
Android,not_removed,could be because of non optimized android apps
Android,not_removed,doesnt the have faster storage than anyone else on the android side
Android,not_removed,its sad how some app developers dont try as hard for android apps coughsnapchatcough
Android,not_removed,thats amazing and i really dont understand why android manufacturers dont use same thing
Android,not_removed,another factor to consider probably because is running at pixels thus less pixels to renderprocessless ram usage lets say the is a screen pixels pixels
Android,not_removed,actually on a core vs core basis its still twice as fast as anything else and simultaneously has far superior thermal characteristics apple is in a class of their own in cpu design
Android,not_removed,well lets wait and see
Android,not_removed,i hope everything has it going forward in doubt the nexus phones will have it
Android,not_removed,i saw a mate vs iphone and mate won
Android,not_removed,less pixels to renderprocessless ram usage well thats why one phone has gb and other of ram
Android,not_removed,i was talking about hardwarenot software
Android,not_removed,i dont think he was fanboiing especially hard storage speed is a massive bottleneck and ios can continue to use gig of ram because reloading an app is so much faster than on android phones i dont like ios and their walledgarden approach to extracting as much money as possible from your wallet for every little thing but theres no question they can design a very impressive phone
Android,not_removed,faster animations and faster iphone will be scary
Android,not_removed,unfortunatelythey wont be they changed the way some animations look but animations are all the same speed from what ive experienced i currently have an iphone running ios preview since my flair lg is currently dead
Android,not_removed,that a year old flagship phone twice the price from multibillion corporation is still beating by seconds only newest budget android phone from small company
Android,not_removed,another factor to consider probably because is running at pixels thus less pixels to renderprocessless ram usage the screen is pixels whilst the needs to render pixels
Android,not_removed,also its still buttery smooth i have an lg but my cousin wanted some help changing her privacy settings on facebook on a and man scrolling just felt so natural and smooth thats not to say my is slow it isnt but it doesnt feel as nice as an iphone
Android,not_removed,i know i am
Android,not_removed,if you were using an iphone youd be saving way more than minutes every day i have never used one but damn do they fly its about time android flagships start matching the memory speeds of iphones
Android,not_removed,lol you scared
Android,not_removed,you dont but it world show how much ahead the really is
Android,not_removed,you cannot dismiss a gold medal of an athlete just because hes from a different country than the runner up and doesnt have the same training methods its more like an athlete running against a cheetah its not a fair comparison
Android,not_removed,well if you buy an iphone you also buy it for the app store
Android,not_removed,but the also runs the same apps on the similar specs as other flagships so you cant blame the apps its not like they use different versions of the same android apps
Android,not_removed,its likely because the iphone is using nvme storage
Android,not_removed,its the same as samsungs flagships
Android,not_removed,price its nearly twice as expensive
Android,not_removed,im not sure about the but the plus renders at by and then downsamples to which means the system is doing more work than simply rendering at the native resolution
Android,not_removed,its still twice as fast as anything else well thats a bullshit statement none of the cpu intensive benchmarks show that the is twice as fast as exnyos or snapdragon chips again most of the speed difference and benchmarks are when storage becomes a factor
Android,not_removed,yep id expect the iphone to have faster storage as well
Android,not_removed,nexus wont even have single channel ufs
Android,not_removed,the thing about ram is that even though the storage is slow to load things on the first run it is able to catch up when most of the already ran app are in the ram so better multitasking i guess even my year old has ram and higher res screen compared to when you compare it side by side the image sharpness is much better on screen the pixels i felt like apple just slap in a lower res screen so the phone can be faster of course most android manufacturer should improve on their storage tech
Android,not_removed,my gets mbs sequential read and write speeds
Android,not_removed,the size of the corporation is irrelevant they buy off the shelf parts that every other company uses
Android,not_removed,you mean that same budget phone that beat the galaxy in the same speedtest
Android,not_removed,so basically without all this gibberish that a year old phone is still beating the newest androids is true
Android,not_removed,the resolution shouldnt matter much when it comes to app loading times the iphone simply has superior nand
Android,not_removed,funny i have the too its a very good phone imo it runs very well with android cyanogenresurrection and without google apps too bad that google hasnt made it possible to download the apk files from google play without having the app installed but luckily there are other options i bet the iphone is perfectly smooth in mostly any situation as it isnt even a hd display but only x pixels compared to the lg x display which is qhd the iphone only needs to to do a fourth the amount of work to update the display but for normal operation the lg isnt really slowed down by the high resolution it has the snapdragon cpu which is a pretty amazing cpu imo capable of high speed on cores efficient for demanding single threaded tasks and with very good multitasking with an additional lower speed cores that add more to total power than more high speed cores would and allows very low power consumption when idling graphics performance is more than sufficient for perfectly smooth interface operation but the defaults on lg absolutely suck animations are set for much too long durations and are absolutely killing how fast it can be operated decrease all animation duration to a fourth of their default values and you will have a much nicer phone to use i have some reduced to ms which is merely frames thats very near instant without being abrupt the lg remains among the best allrounders imo and it has an amazing camera and screen it only isnt very good for for enthusiast gaming in part because of the higher than normal resolution and in part because the gpu is about slower than the top option at the time its by far a better phone than any iphone imo but people can have other priorities¹ that make them prefer something else you can buy phones with better cpus and gpus but to match the lg general strengths at the same time it will cost a lot more than the oneplus although it is faster and very good value it lacks the amazing screen and camera of the but on the other hand it will be way better for gaming ¹this refer mostly to people who are poorly informed and need to reevaluate their priorities on better information
Android,not_removed,i have never used one i have for many years and you would be losing time due to other aspects of ios such as apps having to reload lack of direct sharing options thus having to utilize convoluted methods among other things each have their upsides but neither will net you any significant advantage in terms of time saved
Android,not_removed,haha im back on my old and recently went on holiday somewhere with rubbish reception i was watching my mrs zip through apps on her iphone while mine was still loading up page and i was so jealous ive done iphones before and didnt like it but still
Android,not_removed,legit hiding behind the couch at the thought of the iphone
Android,not_removed,the isnt really that far ahead the animations are there for a reason
Android,not_removed,and google made their version of android to run better on the nexus devices same as any manufacturer does the os interacts with the hardware via drivers no one is hindering oems to make good drivers for android phones
Android,not_removed,how though their cpus use the exact same instruction set as any other arm chip the only place that optimization can happen is in the drivers and apple doesnt own some kind of magical pixie dust that makes their drivers better than those written by google qualcomm samsung etc ios might well be better designed than android in some respects and apple usually uses topnotch hardware unlike most android oems but this optimization bullshit is meaningless
Android,not_removed,ios apps in general seem to be of a better quality they all seem more polished and it just feels like the developers pay way more attention to the ios apps
Android,not_removed,well i guess finally they can justify price then
Android,not_removed,none of the cpu intensive benchmarks show that the is twice as fast as exnyos or snapdragon chips not precisely twice but who really cares it still owns the only thing that is reasonably clear is that synthetic multicore tests put it about the same with half the cores again most of the speed difference and benchmarks are when storage becomes a factor bullshit
Android,not_removed,probably will have the same storage
Android,not_removed,hopefully at least ufs
Android,not_removed,they have the best soc in the industryi doubt that reason for not going is perf ios is not good as android at scaling and with every chance of resolution every app need to be optimised for new resolution otherwise things can be to big and blurry
Android,not_removed,and beats in multitasking with ram
Android,not_removed,nah screen shattered and lcd died
Android,not_removed,this is not true at all apple has a huge amount of bargaining power with manufacturers if apple makes a part order theyre going to get the lowest possible price because the manufacturer knows that theyll move a shit ton of units the same cant be said for any other company other than maybe samsung
Android,not_removed,oh nbsp s
Android,not_removed,so are we talking about samsung now
Android,not_removed,yeah it basically comes down to some phones are faster than others the end
Android,not_removed,cant find any speed comparison test between the and the plus but the smaller less pixels device has a faster boot speed im not too sure either though
Android,not_removed,apps having to reload my android devices perform worse at this while having double the ram why
Android,not_removed,the with cm is awesome d android flagships arent behind by much and considering the lack of optimisation everyone is always talking about seconds in minutes is nothing
Android,not_removed,and how would you know that without turning off animations
Android,not_removed,yeah during the first opening of an app animations does not slow down anything but when closing the apps and the multitasking test they are limiting factor even does not use mm closing animation they use faster fade one
Android,not_removed,well yeah apple devs only need to optimization for or so of phones vs several hundred on android so of course its going to be more optimized this is definitely an apple pro as long as what you want falls within what apple wants to do or lets you do its a fantastic platform
Android,not_removed,even googles apps are better on ios than android
Android,not_removed,apple can have crazy high profit margins and still use expensive parts its pretty interesting
Android,not_removed,iphone has been using it for a while now
Android,not_removed,not precisely twice but who really cares so in other words your comment was complete crap with nothing to back it up
Android,not_removed,the nand industry is one thats really competitive at the moment theres been steady improvements from several companies ill be surprised if iphone storage isnt at least faster
Android,not_removed,but plus does run on though i tried finding a speed test between the two but couldnt find any exynos is another soc that im really interested in according to this its much faster compared to qualcomm counterpart vs i dont understand why samsung isnt including it in more devices though heard great things on the battery efficiency too
Android,not_removed,no hes pointing out that you cannot use prices to justify the results because if an expensive phone iphone is faster than a cheaper one as an inevitability then all android flagships are not worth the premium price they are placed at
Android,not_removed,generally the plus beats the in most benchmarks but theres nothing to be argued about really app loading times will mostly be decided by the storage speeds
Android,not_removed,youre asking the wrong person haha maybe because android apps tend to be poorly optimized compared to their ios counterparts im not sure although double the ram of an iphone doesnt mean much because android and ios handle memory much differently afaik
Android,not_removed,im suprised its still working so well considering its years old i mean seriously how many iphone do you see kicking about nowadays but i seriously cant wait to have the cash for the
Android,not_removed,because i do have an jailbroken
Android,not_removed,but they should optimize it for the prices they demand
Android,not_removed,because they cheap out on other things the screen probably costs them basically nothing given that theyve been using the same res panel since the iphone theres no quick charging so they can give a cheap charger and theres no fast charging circuitry they design cpus inhouse so while theres a large initial cost for rd the cost perunit is lower because they dont have to pay qualcomm they recycle their external design every other year saving them a buttload on rd and design costs apple makes these smart costcutting moves so they can maintain their massive profit margins and its working edit i see many iphone users are butthurt about what ive said the fact of the matter is that apple didnt come to be the worlds most valuable hardware tech company with small profit margins i never said the iphone wasnt a great phone im just pointing out some of their obvious costcutting measures
Android,not_removed,not true the iphone is the first phone ever to use nvme storage
Android,not_removed,was complete crap with nothing to back it up im afraid all of your claims are clearly bullshit and you didnt back any of them
Android,not_removed,i dunno man i think those amoled and waterproof and edge features dont come free from factories edit i guess we are talking about samsung now
Android,not_removed,i see
Android,not_removed,actually it mainly comes down to android using gc while ios doesnt
Android,not_removed,the iphone is years old years old is the iphone and you see many of those
Android,not_removed,starting from the iphone you can quick charge with a ipad charger
Android,not_removed,the screen probably costs them basically nothing given that theyve been using the same res panel since the iphone what the iphone was definitely not or like the iphone and plus are they recycle their external design every other year this isnt true either with the the is thicker uses a different type of aluminum and has different internals due to the taptic engine and touch
Android,not_removed,dude youre in the wrong here just give up already
Android,not_removed,i guess we are now but those features dont affect the speed the fact is iphone is a very fast phone probably the fastest but it doesnt mean its the best phone there are more to a smartphone than just speed i just dont like people pulling excuses to deny the speed or the iphone
Android,not_removed,does the screen resolution affect speed ram usage the are running on a mere x pixels screen that is about the pixels of screen
Android,not_removed,im all confused then is then
Android,not_removed,source nothing ive found says it actually charges significantly faster even the ipad pro cant fast charge with a highamp charger
Android,not_removed,whoops i mean ppi the ppi of the and the are exactly the same these displays are made in sheets and then cut to size keeping the same ppi means they can manufacture the same sheets and simply cut them to different sizes the iphone and have functionally the same design look at one of the teardowns and youll see basically no difference do you really think there were any development costs to apple for making their phone half a millimetre thicker
Android,not_removed,my current phones actual screen resolution is running at though
Android,not_removed,unless youre playing extremely graphicsintensive games or running benchmarks not really
Android,not_removed,yes the galaxy has been released months before the iphone came out
Android,not_removed,the ipad pro can fast charge with the retina macbook charger apparently too httpwwwcnetcomhowtoipadprofastcharging
Android,not_removed,i think there were some large costs involved in creating touch and taptic engine hardware and fitting them inside the phones
Android,not_removed,i see they do charge faster but not as fast as something like qualcomm qc or dash charge and my point about including chargers in the box still stands
Android,not_removed,for the and id agree but the and and everything before that has a small enough battery to not need anything more

Android,not_removed,not a fan of his negative attitude when it isnt warranted hes laughing at things that just dont seem laughable for a phone that came out in acting like a qhd screen and camera are old when there are plenty of phones on sale right now with worse specs the only thing a galaxy amp has over this is the quad core processor but it will probably work about the same
Android,not_removed,man this phone was so terrible and then to have it replaced by a new better thinner phone in just months was just sad
Android,not_removed,i turned on my droid x not long ago man that thing really shows its age

Android,not_removed,is that a rom not too familiar
Android,not_removed,yes i believe the droid x was officially updated to cm is kit kat so someone unofficially brought the x five android versions newer than it should have ever been
Android,not_removed,thats pretty crazy does it actually run well seems like it wouldnt be usable

Android,not_removed,why link it badly i might add
Android,not_removed,also imessage imessage imessage imessage imessage
Android,not_removed,an core chipshould be great for battery life but mediocre for performance
Android,not_removed,damn those phones look super nice especially the i hope they are ditching their redmi back design for this one i dont like the symmetrical camera on top of my scanner
Android,not_removed,wow that sounds awful sounds worse than anything qualcomm offers and not a better than mediatek old and outdated all around
Android,not_removed,so not that great for battery either unlike the
Android,not_removed,can someone explain why there are two lots of the same core clocked at different speeds wouldnt it be easier to just have cores and run them at different speeds depending on work level
Android,not_removed,i mean every redmi variant and the redmi have the camera in the corner only the redmi proper has the centrally placed camera above the fingerprint scanner
Android,not_removed,not bad for a first attempt dont you think we saw the same thing happen for there are rumours of a high end part from xiaomi later this year
Android,not_removed,unless this is a sub dollar phone soc im not sure it is compelling
Android,not_removed,its a pretty competitive phone even without considering its an inhouse chip
Android,not_removed,its launching on a phone with a big ips lots of storage some other features
Android,not_removed,thats pretty awful better use ufs or something impressive
Android,not_removed,ufs
Android,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiuniversalflashstorage
Android,not_removed,let me get this straight you want a budget phone that already undercuts the competition by a good to have a card slot thats never been made before for a card you cant even buy
Android,not_removed,ufs has been used for years it doesnt undercut anyone i can get a moto g for cheaper thats better
Android,not_removed,please link me phone that uses ufs and at least ufs card since you can get a microsd class card for please link the moto g with price i cant seem to find one that competes
Android,not_removed,galaxy and galaxy among many others een in pones a low price as the one plus there arent any cards yet but they use it built in moto easily takes this on and thats a year old
Android,not_removed,moto easily takes this on and thats a year old cpu differences are hard to understate ghz ghz on the xiaomi vs ghz ghz on the moto the is still using emmc too mi has a metal body so it wont thermally throttle until much later too
Android,not_removed,the is bigger so of course the pixel density is lower since they have the same resolution the cores are the same they arent way faster clocking the same cores a little faster isnt going to do much just trading battery life for a little extra performance the gpu isnt any better and they both support open vg i doubt either of them will throttle using cores not very compelling if it barely competes with a year old cheaper phone
Android,not_removed,is nearly a increase on the work cores and is a increase on the idle cores it does a lot for performance the difference between gpus is bigger than the difference between cpus between the two phones are you saying pixel density isnt a factor

Android,not_removed,machine learning all the things
Android,not_removed,i think its clear at this point that google intends docs to be used for rich notes and keep to be used for quick notes checklists etc i only wish docs had a notes mode or something that would make it scale well across screens as it stands its designed conserve how it would appear in print so if something looks right on a desktop youll have to scroll sideways a lot on your phone or tablet
Android,not_removed,the update is rolling out today its been slowly rolling for some time now ive had it for at least a week

Android,not_removed,machine learning is so awesome
Android,not_removed,keep is free tho
Android,not_removed,um been keeping up on the news lately

Android,not_removed,unfortunately im not sure when theyll have more versions out and im not the reviewer in the video just a subscriber who thought it was a good video to share

Android,not_removed,i feel like this belongs in rgooglepixel
Android,not_removed,how much did you get it for
Android,not_removed,it can belong here too as the pixel is an android device
Android,not_removed,gb dollars for months
Android,not_removed,you could get the for through verizon
Android,not_removed,in best buy im still kicking myself because i couldnt get it it was out of stock everywhere
Android,not_removed,sell that shit and keep and eye out for nexus deals on amazon
Android,not_removed,supposedly mine is available to picked up on thursday hopefully i can do the deal
Android,not_removed,edge vs plus is there much of a difference in overall feel in the hand my store doesnt have a demo yet and idk when ill see my samsung rep again i need to know
Android,not_removed,cant wait to receive my orchid grey hopefully tmobile ships early lol
Android,not_removed,damn that thing is massive cant wait to get mine that thing will be a reddit machine
Android,not_removed,as a fellow how do the edge displays work is it wasted space palm rejection work ok
Android,not_removed,the edges of the feel not as prominent compared to the it honestly feels much better in hand and in using
Android,not_removed,i was impressed with the purple subtlety of the orchid grey i really like how it looks
Android,not_removed,here is what they look like side by side as for the edge it a not really that much of an issue as for palm rejection i had no issues with accidental touching of the screen i wouldnt really consider it wasted space as it does not take up that much of the display as someone with a nexus i feel like this could be a genuine upgrade the only thing i would wait out on is seeing if it can be rooted and rom flashed with something stock like
Android,not_removed,thanks for the response i finally got to feel it and it reminds me of the note makes my edge feel awkward
Android,not_removed,i need to go see it myself at best buy but as soon as i saw videos of that color i knew it was what i wanted
Android,not_removed,thanks im also thinking this could be a real option for upgrading finally i still want to see the mi mix and the pixel
Android,not_removed,time to learn how to use rss
Android,not_removed,wait does that mean google is now a valid tld since when did the icann start allowing this and have any other organisations besides google implemented this and is this open for all users or just registered companies
Android,not_removed,how can i add this to feedly
Android,not_removed,cool to see the keyword is a perfect name too
Android,not_removed,it doesnt use blogger anyone know what it is on or custom
Android,not_removed,totally should have gone with glog
Android,not_removed,is the google to g transition really janky for anyone else
Android,not_removed,this is actually awesome
Android,not_removed,i guess blogger is officially dead
Android,not_removed,holy shit that tld is bomb
Android,not_removed,just wondering now that google has a tld cant they make httpgoogle redirect to httpgooglecom
Android,not_removed,i know i am being pettie roosevelt but i hate when companies use outdated social sharing icons come on google instagram changed their icon a while ago
Android,not_removed,they have a latest tweets section instead of latest g posts
Android,not_removed,great it was rather inconvenient to have an rss feed for every single product and there wasnt a clear overview of the different blogs and then youd still miss new stuff this feels like something they shouldve done much earlier glad theyre catching up
Android,not_removed,because people definitely like going to multiple places for things that can be allinone cough allo messenger hangouts cough
Android,not_removed,i wow how hasnt this existed until now im actually kind of surprised
Android,not_removed,weird the video they want to show in the google update blog post is private blog post httpsbloggoogletopicsinsidegooglegoogleupdate video url httpswwwyoutubecomembedolfepemwghk of course there is nowhere to comment on their blog
Android,not_removed,is this related to the fact that my rss reader subscribed to a number of googles other blogs such as the gmail blog google chrome blog etc is suddenly surfacing stories from as far back as
Android,not_removed,cant wait until this gets phased out too as soon as it shows promise
Android,not_removed,still wont have changelogs for their apps more detailed than speed and stability enhancements that never change nor are updated
Android,not_removed,how does the url not have com behind it
Android,not_removed,wow this looks slick google knows how to do cool stuff
Android,not_removed,wait a minute here i thought they changed their name to alphabet
Android,not_removed,wow didnt know google was top level domain how did they even get it
Android,not_removed,that top level domain though
Android,not_removed,ohits not hosted in twitter
Android,not_removed,shooooore
Android,not_removed,is this where i can buy an election for my candidate of choice
Android,not_removed,about time their blog was so super dated
Android,not_removed,so the new products for the next two months will be there and then theyll move onto something different
Android,not_removed,thats something new google new
Android,not_removed,now if only they can consolidate their communication servicesapps as well thatd be great
Android,not_removed,not really
Android,not_removed,shouldnt the title saygoogle has a new blog all new product news will be here weeks after leaks reveal the products first
Android,not_removed,the g suite spot
Android,not_removed,a blog really should have just got a tumblr account
Android,not_removed,what a shitty design
Android,not_removed,still using goodle in
Android,not_removed,you would think it was called the google blog or something similar because its at httpbloggoogle but this google so they named it the keyword
Android,not_removed,hype for this now do something about that phone price i
Android,not_removed,a blog my grandparents have blogs get with the new decade google sheesh talk about out of touch
Android,not_removed,so what is g suite google apps for work renamed
Android,not_removed,team drive team hangout machine learning in sheets any articles to thath
Android,not_removed,but allo still doesnt have sms doa
Android,not_removed,i was hoping that after hearing google apps was renamed g suite theyd name the blog g spot
Android,not_removed,you know what worries me when they shut down blogger they will delete their own blog too accidentally and then there will be no news
Android,not_removed,whats team drive
Android,not_removed,looking forward to them renaming android pay to g money
Android,not_removed,i really hate the name change to g suite it makes it sound less business like
Android,not_removed,hiroshi is doing his work on point google needs some restructuring and a strong management
Android,not_removed,if only google reader were around
Android,not_removed,you should its way easier to find interesting posts in a neatly organized chronological list than the shitshow of machine algoritm calculated post order that is most modern social media also no ads
Android,not_removed,doesnt look like there is an rss feed on this one so its a step back as far as im concerned they hid it pretty good their official rss feed extension couldnt find it
Android,not_removed,yes the last people at google who understand the power of rss seem to have gone the rss feeds for keyword are a hidden and b missing the body of the article
Android,not_removed,where is the push bullet
Android,not_removed,rss try this push bullet channel httpswwwpushbulletcomchanneltagkeywordblog
Android,not_removed,im disappointed that googlegoogle isnt a thing
Android,not_removed,httpsicannwikicombrandtld
Android,not_removed,currently waiting for httpsearchgoogle to be a thing
Android,not_removed,wait so this isnt bloggooglecom but more like wwwbloggoogle
Android,not_removed,monash university in australia was the first organisation to use a branded tld httpaboutmonash
Android,not_removed,and so the market state begins
Android,not_removed,theyve been using httpdomainsgoogle for a while too
Android,not_removed,one of the longest tlds is travelersinsurance because travelers insurance really needed it apparently
Android,not_removed,not sure how common it is to have wordsasdomain but i recently saw some quebec so i guess its starting to be a thing
Android,not_removed,httpsbloggooglerss
Android,not_removed,why
Android,not_removed,yup thats an excellent name
Android,not_removed,its not hosted on blogger blogger has much different url structure another thing if you have noticed blogger is not even mentioned as their product in this new blog
Android,not_removed,blogger with custom template and domain
Android,not_removed,glog sounds kinda gross tho
Android,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikigogandmagog
Android,not_removed,the googlog
Android,not_removed,gloglol ffs
Android,not_removed,im waiting for the foursquare clone called g spot
Android,not_removed,yep
Android,not_removed,its going to be a while before i stop finishing g suite with charlie in my head
Android,not_removed,nah theyll just abandon this one forever pretending it was never a big focus
Android,not_removed,you guys never give up huh
Android,not_removed,not really thats like saying gmail is dead because there are official employee emails like bobgooglecom although blogger is showing its age
Android,not_removed,i thought blogger had been dead for years
Android,not_removed,i mean its pretty ridiculous for a company the size of google to use fucking blogger for the official company blog this is a welcome change and i dont think it means anything for the future of that product
Android,not_removed,they got httpcomgoogle
Android,not_removed,nope because httpgoogle isnt a valid uri xyzgoogle would be edit
Android,not_removed,you cant set a redirect for just a tld as far as i understand it wont resolve outside your lanpc
Android,not_removed,deleted
Android,not_removed,but instagrams new icon is absolute shit
Android,not_removed,there is no instagram share icon that i can see i see a linkedin logo if thats what youre referring to
Android,not_removed,to be fair the new instagram icon is shit
Android,not_removed,i think even google is admitting defeat in google theyve removed it from the default google apps on android refocused it on shared interests more similar to reddit added it to the g suite core apps which means that updates will be very slow since enterprise users dont appreciate change much ive never heard of an actual enterprise using google apps has anyone seen this the closest ive seen is medium sized businesses and larger schools
Android,not_removed,because it is google
Android,not_removed,their parent company is alphabet their robotics and science stuff mostly
Android,not_removed,theres tons of shit like tech xxx etc
Android,not_removed,no the blogs they use for its products have the information almost at release or maybe an hour or two late for minor things its all at the same time they send press releases
Android,not_removed,so close to being uniform and cohesive yet so far away like having an amazing play store that arguably puts apples to shame but with next to no filter options ironic considering its google does google ever knock the ball out of the park no available downsides like ever always so fucking close to acing it instant default downvote seriously guys we all know the way google names their websites and apps is inconsistent and doesnt match for a company trying so hard to be cohesive its not really working well but ok downvote me today see a new thread talking about it in a few weeks and then the op gets gold flimsy ass bastards
Android,not_removed,i got you fam calling the google rn
Android,not_removed,blogs are still a thing
Android,not_removed,why does this sub bitch about everything
Android,not_removed,they already had various blogs this is just unifying their product articles
Android,not_removed,you couldnt wait day right haha
Android,not_removed,exactly announced today
Android,not_removed,yeah google for work is now google cloud google apps for work is now g suite google cloud makes sense but what the hell is g suite im just trying to figure out how to tell a potential client what it is it just doesnt sound right
Android,not_removed,should have gone with g unit
Android,not_removed,hear me out here but i think allo is meant to go beyond sms dont get me wrong i wish allo did more and tackled imessage head on but this is most likely a stepping stone jibe will also be a thing eventually
Android,not_removed,there are no calling features as well
Android,not_removed,americans seem to be the only people in the world who still care about sms
Android,not_removed,who uses sms still
Android,not_removed,why does it have bezzzzeeels
Android,not_removed,what do you mean it will send sms for me
Android,not_removed,still too soon
Android,not_removed,feedly
Android,not_removed,newsblur
Android,not_removed,i found digg reader to be the closest experience to the old google reader and also the only use i have for digg in years
Android,not_removed,httpsttrssorggitlabfoxttrsswikishome
Android,not_removed,digg reader is nice
Android,not_removed,commafeed is a great alternative httpswwwcommafeedcomwelcome
Android,not_removed,eh redditcomrandroidnew
Android,not_removed,here httpswwwpushbulletcomchanneltagkeywordblog
Android,not_removed,comgoogle is a thing though
Android,not_removed,im disappointed that googlegoogle isnt a thing im mad about mapsgoogle you cant type mapsgoogle and press ctrl enter now in chrome
Android,not_removed,im disappointed that httpsgoogle doesnt yet work
Android,not_removed,and it costs
Android,not_removed,im waiting for httpimagesgoogle and others
Android,not_removed,yep theres no com or even www the full url is httpbloggoogle edit minor text fixes
Android,not_removed,viewsourcehttpsbloggooglerss xmlnsmediahttpsearchyahoocommrss huh
Android,not_removed,where youre from is an important part of who you are and the name the keyword is a nod to the origins of search keywords also unlock information which is what were hoping to do here — provide a central official source of news about who we are what we do and what we value plus we like that it has word in it
Android,not_removed,here i think you dropped this
Android,not_removed,its not on blogger they havent even mentioned blogger as one of their product in there
Android,not_removed,ah thank you
Android,not_removed,no thats not it i know because every time i visit a blogger site i get the cookies notice every fucking time fuck i hate some of eus bullshit
Android,not_removed,very gross
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,so does g suite but it didnt stop them
Android,not_removed,in modern times they remain associated with apocalyptic thinking especially in the united states and the muslim world ignore climate change but do worry about hairyeared halfmen living in a mountain ushering in the end of days fuuuuuck
Android,not_removed,ahahaaha
Android,not_removed,and a tinder clone called g string
Android,not_removed,i wish theyd revamped blogger to at least material design and fleshed out the bugs caused by age some people cant afford hosting
Android,not_removed,they dont give it much love
Android,not_removed,still going strong i host multiple sites on it nice and cheap and they allow for a lot of customization
Android,not_removed,many of the official google blogs are hosted on blogger someone in this thread even said that this blog is hosted on blogger but with a custom domain that said im surprised that google hasnt acquired or simulated something more like squarespace
Android,not_removed,try httpto though it works the reference says about regname the following such a name consists of a sequence of domain labels separated by each domain label starting and ending with an alphanumeric character and possibly also containing characters the rightmost domain label of a fully qualified domain name in dns may be followed by a single and should be if it is necessary to distinguish between the complete domain name and some local domain regname unreserved pctencoded subdelims if theres just the tld theres only one domain label so no need for separators if they wanted they could add the ending dot so it would be httpgoogle i think the only problem is browsers and other programs that dont recognise the format
Android,not_removed,they could make httpgoogle work though dotless domains are a thing
Android,not_removed,so that is still their branding shit or not if objective shit were a thing anyway
Android,not_removed,httpimgurcommayltjl
Android,not_removed,howd they do that
Android,not_removed,so now its
Android,not_removed,so youre saying we dont know anything about the pixel and pixel xl weeks before its released
Android,not_removed,for a billion company i have a feeling theyll be fine
Android,not_removed,yeah i know i just said my grandparents have blogs
Android,not_removed,he is a troll
Android,not_removed,unifying their product without a unified name ffs how cryptic can you get the keyword
Android,not_removed,goggle feed sounds cool because it has an option to enable the feed
Android,not_removed,but what the hell is g suite a fabled set of apps which causes their devs untold amounts of pleasure upon usage no one seems to know where to find it though
Android,not_removed,g suite has an aws ring to it
Android,not_removed,thats where snoop dogg hangs out
Android,not_removed,im just trying to figure out how to tell a potential client what it is it just doesnt sound right just dont mess up and call it g spot
Android,not_removed,g suite seems like the equivalent of ms office open office its a suite of programs i think google is trying to get away from calling them apps because apps sounds immature or small scale and not like something an enterprise would use to run a company
Android,not_removed,what the hell is g suite probably a play on httpwwwinvestopediacomtermsccsuiteasp
Android,not_removed,obviously an office suite made by google i dont see how that name would cause problems
Android,not_removed,thanks man really interesting
Android,not_removed,jibe wut edit httpsjibegooglecom til
Android,not_removed,yeah but the bezels on allos chin
Android,not_removed,a stepping stone that is in the wrong direction i cant really think of a reason to use allowed over hangouts besides being able to resize text
Android,not_removed,why couldnt they just have built up messenger light fast handles sms like a champ
Android,not_removed,i guess sma must be a lot more common in the states or something i live in south korea and ive used sms maybe times and those were for people who ran out of data so it was just or messages total im always pretty shocked at how much it seems that people in this sub still use sms i couldnt imagine having an actual conversation over sms although im gonna assume that sms itself might be a bit more modernly implemented in the states if its so widely used
Android,not_removed,beyond but not beyond one device
Android,not_removed,so will gtalk everyone is using that right
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,what would you consider beyond sms unless its the ability to cross platform message with imessage hangouts whatsapp and facebook i dont know what that would be and dont say that the plan is for everyone to use allo because with my address book that is not a possibility even if allo gets forced on to every phone handset in north america
Android,not_removed,i think its still gonna get sms allo co lead teased it
Android,not_removed,brit here and i would love it to support sms i just want a single messaging app as a few people i communicate with dont use allo even though ive pointed it out to them
Android,not_removed,also majority of europe and nearly entire africa asia and south america there exists a world outside of franceukgermany
Android,not_removed,does no one use netvibes ive never heard anyone recommend netvibes ive been using it since years and yet havent found anything which is as good as this
Android,not_removed,i have to say that the last time i used feedly right after google reader died i disliked the cards ui i just want a very very simple app that shows me a list with headlines that i can click im sure there are a couple alternatives for me by now gut greader was perfect
Android,not_removed,ive found inoreader to be the most reader like of the alternatives
Android,not_removed,i recall a good experience with newsblur and their layout options newsblur is open source they dont put as many features behind their premium version as feedly does and newsblur premium is cheaper than feedly vs
Android,not_removed,used httptheoldreadercom
Android,not_removed,i agree best ever but you cant recommend this to randroid
Android,not_removed,its good stuff but has a somewhat higher barrier to entry than a lot of party services
Android,not_removed,but that is not the default view
Android,not_removed,good on ya for spreading the word about that sub brother ¯ツ¯
Android,not_removed,boy am i gonna mess with my friends using this just go to com dot google you mean google dot com whats that i always just go to comgoogle
Android,not_removed,on april comgoogle was a mirror image of googlecom its a little disappointing that now its just a redirect
Android,not_removed,this is so google
Android,not_removed,so librariespackages they write are now going to be called googlecomfoobar
Android,not_removed,people still user ctrl enter sites have seldom required www for a while now googlecom isnt really a long thing to type and you dont have to guess whether you want shift it shift ctrl for net or other and if theres another tld whether theres a shortcut or not
Android,not_removed,i set googles lucky search as my default search handler so if i simply type maps in my url bar and press enter it takes me to google maps directly i do the same for gmail mail contacts calendar drive plus etc really handy
Android,not_removed,where do you see that figure
Android,not_removed,pornbing
Android,not_removed,no https
Android,not_removed,plus key word can be a pun for important word or important news
Android,not_removed,as a hairyeared halfman living on a mountain i take offense to the notion that i have that kind of power i wish as for that passage i think its referring less to usian and muslim parents to this day tell stories of gog and magog to scare the shit out of their kids and more that scholars of the two cultures adhere more closely to the later interpretation of the roles of the charactersplacespeople of gog and magog as opposed to the somewhat more benign version from the hebrew bible thats how i read it anyway
Android,not_removed,its not the hosting just feature by feature it lacks behind say wordpresscom free version of the self hosted org
Android,not_removed,i moved to using jekyll with githubio free domain
Android,not_removed,they use the technology not the domain should have been more specific
Android,not_removed,nah that person is totally wrong as a techie with contacts to blogger team i can confirm blogger is an abandoned product new interns work on it and fuckup something about blogger functionality every once in a week also if u havent noticed blogger isnt even mentioned as their product in new site
Android,not_removed,i stand corrected thats kinda neat thanks
Android,not_removed,if you still know the icon represents instagram why does it matter i see airports with the old logo and it doesnt matter
Android,not_removed,they created google to compete with com soon everyone will be making the switch facebookgoogle youtubegoogle etc
Android,not_removed,you can buy custom tlds for your brand it costs a couple hundred thousand dollars though
Android,not_removed,yes
Android,not_removed,what are the
Android,not_removed,i miss leaks in your comment either way it doesnt make sense no one is going to stop releasing official blog posts because of leaks
Android,not_removed,obviously is there a point there
Android,not_removed,a feeding machine you might say
Android,not_removed,pleasure intensifies
Android,not_removed,just g it
Android,not_removed,google cloud is the aws competitor g suite is more like office onlineoffice
Android,not_removed,fo shizzle my google
Android,not_removed,great now im paranoid ah well hopefully they have a sense of humor
Android,not_removed,rcs bb httpsjibegooglecom
Android,not_removed,why is all of this not just in hangouts google wtf
Android,not_removed,did they just have a mistake typing jive and just ran with it what does jibe mean
Android,not_removed,word useless ass chin
Android,not_removed,and why doesnt the pixel have sms fallback smh google
Android,not_removed,hangouts is useless if you dont have a friend to talk to
Android,not_removed,sms is a universal standard feature that ships with all phones and us carriers hardly charge any money for text messages at this point so theres no real downside to using it here obviously im apps have more advanced features like stickers or whatever but while fun and gimmicky those are nonessential for quickly sendingreceiving information since sms is on all phones out of the box you dont need to figure out which service your contact wants to use or whether or not they have yours send an sms text and youre guranteed theyll receive it no matter what kind of phone or data plan they have
Android,not_removed,yeah im german but sms is dead here too im not sure why its so fricken popular in the us i couldnt give a damn far more important would be a multimessenger where i could receive messages and send messages no matter if the other person is on allo hangouts whatsapp facebook etc
Android,not_removed,in the us sms has gone from charging something like cents per message to unlimited messages are included in your plan meanwhile messaging apps eat your data sure its a tiny amount but unlimited sms has become a selling point for us carriers and they arent letting that go any time soon the rest of the world has moved on and meanwhile we still use the standard system for measurement and just recently got chip pin for debitcredit cards
Android,not_removed,at this point id rather segregate sms and other chat protocols until we finally settle on a good universal protocol allo would be no better for me if it had sms and it could even be worse i would like to see username support multidevice support and desktop support in allo though
Android,not_removed,huuuh france is sms
Android,not_removed,south américa uses whatsapp nobody uses sms dont talk if you dont know
Android,not_removed,majority of europe uses whatsapp i know people from all over europe and they all say the same thing everyone uses whatsapp this is anecdotal ofc
Android,not_removed,a stupid one apparently
Android,not_removed,i used it a few years back cant remember why i even stored using it but there were limitations that frustrated me anyway i found httptheoldreadercom once google reader went down and have found that to be the best rss reader remaining
Android,not_removed,i used it as a reader and igoogle replacement works okay as an rss aggregate but it keeps signing me out no matter what i do so its pretty awful as a start page
Android,not_removed,i think i heard about it and used it for a little but feedly somehow came on like a storm im willing to give it a try again
Android,not_removed,feedly does that
Android,not_removed,oh sorry to hear this we have multiple views available title only is the most used one
Android,not_removed,try httpswwwinoreadercom its pretty simple and does pretty much everything reader used to do
Android,not_removed,i feel you it was clean and simple i kind of like g setup it kind of mixes a bit of the twitter with a reader for news but obviously its more people focused i do think they are heading more in the direction it should have even though its more niche than they would have liked i always jump all over the place with stuff like this
Android,not_removed,i use my feedly account with greader pro and enjoy it personally i really hate the feedly ui but i do have to say their search and rssgroups features are pretty nice they also support opml export to various cloud services too
Android,not_removed,httpcommafeedcom is the perfect google reader replacement
Android,not_removed,i remember using it after the demise of greader but i cant exactly recall the reasons why i didnt stick with it
Android,not_removed,better randroid than rfashionvictims sorry that should read rapple
Android,not_removed,its literally a click away from the default view and thats still more convenient in the shirt term than learning how to use rss which was my argument
Android,not_removed,some mobile apps allow you to change the default subreddit sort
Android,not_removed,found the java developer
Android,not_removed,well because to make that mirror image they accidentally completely broke the csrf security of googlecom
Android,not_removed,that would be amazing
Android,not_removed,it used to work well because wwwmapsgooglecom redirected properly now you cant use it since google is a tld but has no maps so you have to actually type out mapsgooglecom entirely its so horrible the point is not having to type the com www is just a side effect
Android,not_removed,yeah it still lets you skip typing com
Android,not_removed,httpsnewgtldsicannorgenapplicantsglobalsupportfaqsfaqsen how do i apply for a new gtld the evaluation fee is applicants will be required to pay a deposit fee per requested application slot when registering the deposit will be credited against the evaluation fee other fees may apply depending on the specific application path see the section of the httpsnewgtldsicannorgapplicantsagb for details about the methods of payment additional fees and refund schedules
Android,not_removed,its not indicated on the linked wiki page thats just how much it costs
Android,not_removed,thats just httpbingcom
Android,not_removed,it has https
Android,not_removed,hoping to not come across as condescending here but how old are you keyword is a very old mainstream internet term before the days of hashtags you would regularly see movie trailers tv radio and print ads etc telling you what aol keyword to search to find their product online i think itll actually be a very well understood reference
Android,not_removed,as an up to date android fan the term keyword makes me think of aol
Android,not_removed,you should really use your own domain so that its easier to move away from github pages once you need more advanced hosting you can get a com for less than per year github pages works fine with custom domains you just need to configure a cname github dont have a way to configure permanent redirects so if you use one of their subdomains then its difficult to properly move your site elsewhere in the future
Android,not_removed,i tried jekyll in the past but looks like im too dumb to understand its syntax and to make me even more embarrassed i develop softwares for a living
Android,not_removed,i host my podcast on blogger like completely it seems like this might be a wise time to make a change i need to change my rss info from feedburner as well so maybe i should change the whole thing
Android,not_removed,brands have usage standards for their assets and a techfacing company like google would normally be one to adhere they expect it with their own products theres nothing you can do but its an expectation
Android,not_removed,googlegoogle
Android,not_removed,well thats pretty cheap when youre google
Android,not_removed,yeah that you have no idea what you are talking about take your pessimism elsewhere
Android,not_removed,no google cloud platform is the aws competitor
Android,not_removed,i know im just talking about the marketing effect of a type of name
Android,not_removed,that website does a bad job of explaining what rcs is i still dont understand
Android,not_removed,oh good another messaging app from google
Android,not_removed,when a sailboat turns with the wind behind it causing an accelerated movement of the boom
Android,not_removed,yeah im thinking of having my asschin surgically removed
Android,not_removed,seeing as how allo doesnt have sms integration how is it any different
Android,not_removed,i agree hangouts is not that great by itself but the google voice integration is what made it a service that i would pay for all my texts on my phone tablet and computer send and receive calls over wifi speechtotext voicemail etc
Android,not_removed,its popular in the us because plans here have had unlimited sms forever so people had no incentive to change
Android,not_removed,far more important would be a multimessenger where i could receive messages and send messages no matter if the other person is on allo hangouts whatsapp facebook etc we missed that boat itd be like saying id like one universal language to speak to anyone in the world too many multinational companies have invested way too much money to have exclusive proprietary messaging applications disa is an app thats trying but progress is slow maybe in years
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,far more important would be a multimessenger where i could receive messages and send messages no matter if the other person is on allo hangouts whatsapp facebook etc thatssms well thats the reason sms is so popular over here its effectively free on most every carrier and no matter what other chat services your friends use your message will get there
Android,not_removed,at this point id rather segregate sms and other chat protocols until we finally settle on a good universal protocol weve been in this game for years going back to aol instant messages vs icq vs irc and even further with disjointed individual bbss keep wishing for a universal protocol but its not going to happen
Android,not_removed,im from europe and i have literally zero contacts who use whatsup almost like europe isnt one homogenous country
Android,not_removed,poland havent seen a single person using whatsapp everybody uses messenger and sms
Android,not_removed,same in most south american countries
Android,not_removed,nope nearly everyone uses whatsapp but everyone uses sms sms works wether you have data or not is often faster is ubiquitous and needs no other account or setting up i use hangouts with my gf sms with everyone else because i dont want to use whatsapp friends still message me
Android,not_removed,im not associated with netvibes and dont profit from it so ive got nothing to sell that said i can create different tabs under each tab i can subscribe to different sites i dont even have to know the rss url i can just enter any popular sites name or any sites url and itll autofind all feeds posts feed comments feed etc there are widgets all feeds refresh and fetch new content in real time i can drag n drop the feeds and tabs around theres website view reader view gallery view the list goes on i had tried feedly a few times but it didnt give me as much freedom
Android,not_removed,i should try it out again like i said the only time i used feedly was right after google reader disappeared i didnt know it had the same type of view
Android,not_removed,i did the same i tried out a few and feedly was the one that stuck
Android,not_removed,fair enough
Android,not_removed,they will need to update their package naming to googlecom
Android,not_removed,well it is google
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,couldnt they just allow comgoogle and googlecom in the domain list
Android,not_removed,well thats why modern browsers have autocomplete urls type ma and press enter and youll get to mapsgooglecom
Android,not_removed,or just type map and hit enter
Android,not_removed,ah okay so expensive
Android,not_removed,yeah sure they have https but the comment said different thats what i meant
Android,not_removed,also cool the certificate authority that gives out that certificate is google inc
Android,not_removed,keyword was really just an aol thing
Android,not_removed,ask jeeves
Android,not_removed,the downside to using a custom domain with github pages is you cant take advantage of their https anymore nor substitute your own without using an intermediary like cloudflare
Android,not_removed,it is actually very simple if you use one of the templates and not try to build from scratch forkcopy the template update the config file and start writing posts in markdown that is all there is to it httpsgithubcomdaattalibeautifuljekyll
Android,not_removed,same here
Android,not_removed,if that was the intent then thats fine it makes sense my thinking is that there was an official google blog on blogger which now is being redirected to this httpsgoogleblogblogspotcom even googling google blog still gives this domain at the moment i dont think there was a professional internal company use for gmailcom unless very early beta since it was always consumer driven hence why my thinking was for domain tldr there was an official google blogger never an official google gmail
Android,not_removed,if you are serious about your podcast and blog i suggest it is better to switch to wordpress wordpress gives you lot more control than blogger i recommend self hosted wordpress blog which is not that hard at all but you need to be really careful with the wordpress host that you choose i recommend setting it up on digital ocean with serverpilot its base plan just per month only pro is i see on blogger is its on googles server so your blog will never be down even it if goes frontpage on reddit
Android,not_removed,googleyahoo aol keyword google
Android,not_removed,oh okay ill just share it with the million of people in america who have no idea google does anything besides a search engine way to have an intelligent conversation and sway someone your way dirt bag enjoy your dollar bone stock phone
Android,not_removed,so with sms you can only send texts of certain length right with mms you can also send small videos images and participate in group texts with rcs you can do all of that plus pretty much anything else you would want out of a messenger all via what we consider text imagine fb messengeresque functionality but everyone has it and its all over text no more frustration because apple and android devices dont play well because its all one unified standard via the service providers
Android,not_removed,one of the rumors that ive heard is that the application they are describing on the site is actually allo of course the updates will have to come first to bring all the features but i would be pretty surprised if google released another messaging app after all the hype and attention theyre attempting to draw for allo
Android,not_removed,lmfao what is that now eight apps
Android,not_removed,i wish people would stop saying this jibe is not another app rcs is a new protocol that can be integrated into existing apps
Android,not_removed,jibe isnt an app but a platform
Android,not_removed,you can talk to google d
Android,not_removed,you can talk with google assistant whenever you want it even replies instantly and does things for you
Android,not_removed,we have to message people on iphones more often than not and theyre all using imessage which means we have to use sms or convince them to use a messaging app thats not as good as imessage
Android,not_removed,eh i wouldnt say forever my dad still wont text because hes on some old plan that charges per text
Android,not_removed,plans here have also had unlimited sms for at least years but nobody uses sms whatsapp has completely replaced sms for years now and its great
Android,not_removed,email is universal although in some ways its becoming outdated sms used to be universal i think there is an equilibrium to reach even if there are multiple equilibriums the problem with this is tying two protocols together before we reach this equilibrium one of which might not be relevant in the future the major headache with multiple protocols in a single client is either having multiple separate conversations with the same person or having one conversation with someone over multiple protocols and not knowing how continuity is going to work on their end imessage is a stopgap solution here but it only truly works when everyone has an iphone something that is definitely not happening except in isolated circles the other major imessage feature is being able to text from your computer yay you get to use your keyboard but while youre typing long eloquent text messages your friends on their phone can barely read and respond properly lack of twoway eloquence makes this somewhat worthless once again therefore imessagelike apps are not the solution either something appneutral like rcs or a universal app that is hosted by a benevolent central company like allo maybe some time in the future definitely not facebook messenger over my dead body is what will eventually work it would be reaaaally cool if they made rcs or something like rcs advanced enough that it actually had feature parity with email and that it accepted credentials username and password instead of just phone numbers for a terminal address then we could theoretically have a single universal text protocol that you could more easily build out quality communication apps with if this protocol was even somehow pared with audio and video encoding we could even have a single holistic communication protocol or protocol set period but i figure this could be a bit off still the great advantage there is that it could be one account for everything text audio video no phone numbers no emails no sms no other bullshit necessary
Android,not_removed,well yeah its two countries eastern and western europe
Android,not_removed,httpswwwnetvibescomen for the lazy like me
Android,not_removed,hello were sorry to hear this what kind of a freedom would you like within our app or how were limiting that
Android,not_removed,i used to use netvibes a long time ago before igoogle was even a thing when they shifted their focus to business dashboards i left looking at their site it looks like they still focus on business intelligence but im glad to hear that it still has a focus on feeds
Android,not_removed,yep go ahead and try us out youll be surprised how we evolved
Android,not_removed,happy to hear that
Android,not_removed,they could but that would have spoilt the surprise so they allowed for a while if a special token was in the url
Android,not_removed,or perhaps httpsmatrixitasoftwarecom
Android,not_removed,what if mapsbingcom was his most used site that starts with ma
Android,not_removed,i use ctrl enter all the time yes modern browsers have auto complete but if its not a site ive visited but i know the url its easier to just press the two keys also i just tried it on mapsgoogle and it works on edge ie but not in chrome or firefox
Android,not_removed,relatively
Android,not_removed,petty cash for google
Android,not_removed,and its trusted by which browsers edit their ca is signed by geotrust
Android,not_removed,also users who were old enough to know about aol or read print ads are the same users using their trusty flipphone or iphone they dont even know google phones exist i feel like youre jumping to some conclusions based on who you think is old enough to know about aol lol i dont think your opinion is negative towards google its just really making some condescending assumptions about the average person wholl hear about this hell im only and in my mind keyword goes hand in hand with aol
Android,not_removed,maybe its a generational thing but keyword screams aol for anyone thats old enough to have used it sent from an android device
Android,not_removed,yeah i get where youre coming from but from that same point of view you can say a lot of names in the tech industry are arbitrary and not very self explanatory honestly the more i think about it the more google examples come to mind allo is a great recent example unless youre french or say it with the right accent youre going to think someone is telling you that google is now selling medical products chromecast sounds more like itd be a browser for your tv or something rather than a streaming device google sounds like a paid subscription service for google search at least duo implies a pair or companion is involved upon first hearing it without any other context what would someone think an ipad is or a kindle twitter instagram etc i can think of plenty of examples your example with the keyword is maybe a little different given your example of it looking like some crucial piece of information is missing but yeah i guess im trying to say that maybe names dont matter a whole lot anymore as long as people think the product is worth using its like you said anyways people will just search for google blog or google news or whatever to find it i suppose i like that they at least tried something instead of just the google blog modern branding is a weird thing now that you have me thinking about it search engines are good enough now that being self explanatory barely matters but at the same time you know its one of the things that marketers will stress out about the most haha
Android,not_removed,dogpile man cmon what is this amateur hour
Android,not_removed,yeah unfortunately this is one of their many many limitations
Android,not_removed,ohh i havent tried the templates will give it a shot then thanks
Android,not_removed,any challenges i should know about if i have to manually port a somewhat heavy preexisting blogger template to jekyll i really want to move away from using blogger and i can probably improve my webdev skills by learning how to port and serve up using jekyll
Android,not_removed,thanks i have always preferred blogger because of the way that it uses enclosure links to generate the rss feed but that was when i started hosting with wwwarchiveorg that was something like or years ago now i pay for my hosting which is also where i think ill switch my rss feed to and my podcast is more just a hobby but i just want to get ahead of any website changes not be forced into a change before i want to thanks for the advice
Android,not_removed,oh like google maps gmail google photos all with millions of active users in the us my flair is outdated i am currently using an active and a tab
Android,not_removed,the most important thing to me in a messenger service is that i dont have to talk my friends into using it the second most important thing is that i can use it from any device or browser
Android,not_removed,how would carriers charge for that at the moment it seems pretty simple per text message but if you can do all these other things i guess there must be different charges like per second of video chat per kilobyte of media transferred etc it seems like it could get complicated and costly
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,does it require a data connection big appeal of sms for me is it works over cell only my idle drain triples if i have data toggled on all day and i pay for every mb i use on project fi so many apps will sync over data in the background costing me money for no good reason
Android,not_removed,i hope they merge it into hangouts and then with allo that would be nice
Android,not_removed,they say theyre working on an app that handles sms mms and rcs why wouldnt they put sms in allo right away if this is that app
Android,not_removed,this is what i can see too allo will evolve into jibe or jibe is an update of some sort we can hope anyway
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,some old plan well when he updates his plan like the rest of the people here maybe he will text more
Android,not_removed,i havent been able to find and extension that put your feedly feeds in your extension bar conveniently i dont want to go to your web app to view my feeds i used to use an extension called rss feed reader but it doesnt have sync for free then again ive stopped following rss feeds in favour of just reading reddit
Android,not_removed,any news on the ability to disable redirection to amp websites and instead default to the regular mobile html sites i prefer to get the full mobile site when using the app on android so i can see comments at the end of articles removing amp references from the url is a pain
Android,not_removed,then why are they here
Android,not_removed,lol bing maps
Android,not_removed,what kind of advantages can a company have by buying their own tld
Android,not_removed,i have to imagine its a well placed troll line im i grew up with aol and dialup hell id be shocked if he didnt also
Android,not_removed,i think youll find its also location based in australia thats the only thing i think of when i hear the word keywords america on line
Android,not_removed,httpwwwhotbotcom
Android,not_removed,i am not familiar with the intricacies of jekyll i just use a template with no modifications
Android,not_removed,everyone knows those apps most of them are even on ios what does that have to do with no one knowing google makes phones edit i realized i said no one knows google does anything besides a search engine forgive me we all know google makes those apps even grandmothers i meant to say phones that was my mistake
Android,not_removed,finally
Android,not_removed,monthly subscription to advanced messaging for a month
Android,not_removed,because the carriers would have control and they would relish in the idea that they can have control
Android,not_removed,the apostrophe does not mean look out here comes an s nor is it ever used for plurals
Android,not_removed,i agree with your point about carriers although it only takes a few to force all the others to support it but theres no way apple would downright refuse to support a feature of the actual networks their devices are operating on carriers will want rcs to be a selling point for their plans and they will want devices to handle it
Android,not_removed,i could be wrong but i believe the idea is that its over what we consider to be text so there should be no data usage counted against your bill
Android,not_removed,with hangouts being repurposed for business use i dont really know if i would count on that coming to hangouts of course google is known to throw everyone for a loop so i suppose anything is possible
Android,not_removed,imo its not allo google is partnering with carriers and oems to offer a messaging client for android that supports sms mms and rcs and will be based on the universal profile the client will be interoperable with any rcscompliant client across any platform allo afaik wasnt developed with carriers whatsoever right it supports wayy too many features that arent in rcs i think googles new strategy smsmmsrcs client made with carriers new messenger allo googles whatsapp competitor
Android,not_removed,fingers crossed i cant go through another hype train like i did for allo
Android,not_removed,thats the best part
Android,not_removed,not yet were still gathering feedback sorry about that
Android,not_removed,someone can use some google services without using them all
Android,not_removed,million of people in america who have no idea google does anything besides a search engine what does that have to do with no one knowing google makes phones the fact that you yourself have no idea what youre talking about is pretty evident
Android,not_removed,which would guarantee that not all my friends will have it defeating the purpose
Android,not_removed,im on a grandfathered unlimited everything plan that costs per month i cant make any changes to my plan or i lose it this makes me sad face
Android,not_removed,so viber that costs a month lol
Android,not_removed,us carriers ftfy my current carrier is a local it company that also rubs their own public network for a few hundred users they dont give a fuck about control
Android,not_removed,httpsnewsroomtmobilecomnewsandblogsadvancedmessagingbloghtm it just doesnt seem like people care enough for it be a selling point so carriers have no reason to make rcs a priority
Android,not_removed,i love hangouts i dont know why everyone hates on it its fantastic but being left in the dirt
Android,not_removed,with hangouts being repurposed for business use i love how its being repurposed for businessenterprise use but has adventure time and meme emotes now ¯ ツ¯
Android,not_removed,yeah thats more likely
Android,not_removed,i dont think its allo google is partnering with carriers and oems to offer a messaging client for android that supports sms mms and rcs and will be based on the universal profile the client will be interoperable with any rcscompliant client across any platform google is partnering with carriers for allo since when maybe i just havent heard a single bit of news about that maybe its going to be an updated messenger allo supports wayyy too many features that arent in rcs
Android,not_removed,you can reach users to mistrust others you mean teach
Android,not_removed,i just edited my last post after skimming thru my comments i apologize
Android,not_removed,arguably the purpose isnt giving it to everyone for free immediately the purpose is to create a new mobile communication medium richer than sms that doesnt fall under the umbrella of data sms is something that you and all your friends have to pay for too
Android,not_removed,most people in the us dont pay extra for sms because its included with virtually every phone plan if companies try to charge for rcs it will be dead from the get go defeating the purpose
Android,not_removed,but sms is tiny bytes per message a single jpeg is at least bytes right lets not get started on rcs video calling etc isnt that why sms is pretty much always included because it costs nothing essentially i dont understand how the carriers will offer something that costs them money for free i mean if they didid be happily shocked but i mean other telcoms around the world offer free whatsapp data i dont know
Android,not_removed,but didnt it take a long time before it became a standard like that i remember that i used to have a shared sms plan with my brother and we used to have to count our texts because we were paying for a certain number per month sure its basically a given that a cellphone plan will have unlimited sms now but it wasnt always the case
Android,not_removed,im not a network tech but ive heard rcs is actually more spectrally efficient than sms and if carriers start charging for rcs people simply wont use it or turn it off hard to miss something you never had
Android,not_removed,true but i think competition and evolution of the messaging scene will prevent carriers from being able to rack up charges on rcs like they did on sms back in the day
Android,not_removed,right im no network tech eitherbut a byte is a byte jpeg is as compressed as you can get however at least on att they seem to have made no exceptions between sms and mms so maybe the additional costs have already been bundled into the texting plans hmmmmaybe rcs has a chance true but at the same time what do carriers gain if we all use the same messaging service hmmbut google is working with carriers so maybe they have some costsharing plan
Android,not_removed,carriers gain a lot more bandwidth due to rcs greater efficiency and eventually the ability to dump forever
Android,not_removed,ok right im reading up on this it isnt data savings but just bandwidth savings in terms of the cell towers
Android,not_removed,also snapdragon socs are well documented so developing for them is easier is like having an open source software vs a closed source developers will find flaws faster on the open source because they can see exactly what is happening no cves just means no one has found flaws for it not necessarily that doesnt have any
Android,not_removed,a simple google search would have helped and would have lead you to their httpsecuritysamsungmobilecom i think everything here is documented i am quite a regular in and right now the performances are equal samsung has also released kernel sources for the exynos variants so that the development is definitely there now
Android,not_removed,try searching for samsung security bulletin researcher hehhe
Android,not_removed,so far those have just been related to samsungs buggy software not the exynos soc
Android,not_removed,okidokie
Android,not_removed,why the fireworks
Android,not_removed,meh
Android,not_removed,blocks markings on the case that would lead the leaker covering their asses
Android,not_removed,meh its in a huge preproduction case also for the price and specs it has i dont care how it looks that thing is going to be a powerhouse
Android,not_removed,meh at a production prototype fair assessment
Android,not_removed,wait this was a leak why wouldnt they just take the phone out of the case than
Android,not_removed,not suremight be physically locked on there

Android,not_removed,sorry and thank you for notifying me of the rule i didnt see it in the sidebar when i searched for it
Android,not_removed,im on cricket with my att i purchased a att sim with minutes so its activated i cant update to lollipop its time ive been on kitkat forever amd want to upgrade what is the special thing i need to do to make this happen anyone got the step by step guide all the results i find arent very cut and dry
Android,not_removed,pretty sure a video like this comes out with literally every new phone these things unfortunately happen due to faulty battery charger etc quality control can only catch so much
Android,not_removed,thats ugliest case i have ever seen
Android,not_removed,really any component with most lithium battery technologies often have a small bad batch of potentially explosive batteries only seen on a mass scale qc will catch up this has even happened to apple time and time again
Android,not_removed,the chinese woman whose note caught fire was using a usb typec adapter to a microusb cable seeing as shes from china i cant help but think that the adapter wasnt to spec so not samsungs fault edit upon further reexamining the photo i link in the comments below it seems that shes using samsungs typec adapter but the microusb cable used looks very very cheap
Android,not_removed,i saw talking about this on twitter earlier theres been reports of or catching fire since launch that seems unusually high to me
Android,not_removed,i wonder if this was with stock charger
Android,not_removed,that case is like a pullover that you wear at the coldest winter night at alaska i would explode as well if i wear that pullover at the hottest summer day joke aside is there a heat controller to turn off quick charge if device gets too hot that looks scary
Android,not_removed,they probably are using faulty usb c cables
Android,not_removed,mustve been using non spec cable or charger
Android,not_removed,are both exynos and snapdragon variants catching fire i cant seem to find info on the chipsets of these exploding units
Android,not_removed,the next big fire is here
Android,not_removed,thats hot
Android,not_removed,xiaomi has some serious competition
Android,not_removed,if only samsung phones werent shitty enough already
Android,not_removed,what was the actual reasn of catchng fire by samsung note
Android,not_removed,we have the same phone case i live in the dessert still have yet to have any sort of overheating issues dont microwave your phone
Android,not_removed,duarte has shown a vision of the fate of samsung users heed his call and buy a nexus amen
Android,not_removed,quantity over quality
Android,not_removed,on this i have some grievances with qualcomm quickchargesamsung adaptive fast charging over usb typec but im hoping this was a oneoff bathtub curve failure first edit regardless of root cause samsungs pr team and news blogs will be all over this guy in seconds flat thats why you dont hear about these stories more companies rush to bury reports like this other times its the user doing something dumb off camera without more data its impossible to say
Android,not_removed,yeah exactly im glad its happened to someone else that means it wont happen to me
Android,not_removed,per the korea herald samsung suspended all shipments of the device
Android,not_removed,i only have seen the ones about samsung phones but i never really search for those so maybe those are the most frequent ones to explode or combust
Android,not_removed,this is people buying the cheapest a to c cable they possibly can not a note flaw
Android,not_removed,you should have seen it before the fire
Android,not_removed,probably the reason the phone caught fire honestly
Android,not_removed,there are reports of the note exploding while its not charging so its not just the usbc adapger
Android,not_removed,out of a possible couple million is not high
Android,not_removed,it may be high it may not we dont really know what the normal numbers are but the main thing we dont know the scenario for each of those fires if the people are being stupid and using risky chargersadaptorshave damaged the phoneetc then we cant really count those specific ones theres just too many unknowns to make any kind of judgement here
Android,not_removed,it says exactly that in the description
Android,not_removed,yes but quite possibly with cheap chinese cable
Android,not_removed,thanks paris
Android,not_removed,because this never happens to any other phone
Android,not_removed,dont you dare say anything bad about our lord and savior samsung blessings be upon them in this sub heretic
Android,not_removed,its funny you say that with a xiaomi phone because xiaomi phones have been catching fire lately however im not retarded like you and i know its not the companys fault
Android,not_removed,its almost as if every lithium ion battery is at risk of explosion especially when charged with crappy cables
Android,not_removed,the note supports usb pd which it the proper usb c power delivery method it is even faster than qc if you use a usb pd charger
Android,not_removed,hey if you have a moment im pretty close to buying a nexus but some of the reports including the videos ive seen you post are a little terrifying do you have a shortlist of recommended chargers c to c cables and c to normal usb cables
Android,not_removed,this is exactly why i turned off fast charging its a nice feature but it has alot of trade offs ie reduced battery health overheating explosions lol
Android,not_removed,ah the old
Android,not_removed,theres more samsungs sold than any other brand so if they had equal quality control youd still see more of them
Android,not_removed,i have seen a lot of xiaomi phones combust lately
Android,not_removed,note comes with the adapter
Android,not_removed,it would rather combust than live in that case
Android,not_removed,probably what samsung will tell him when he tries to get a replacement
Android,not_removed,true but if youve been to china and here in southeast asia its so easy to buy cables and adapters from a stall on the street with no guarantee of them being properly specced edit okay downvoted for stating facts come here to the philippines and you can buy a usb cable from any stall along the street that sells them will you get one that always pushes out almost never
Android,not_removed,you have any links to these reports
Android,not_removed,that we know of with this usb c cable issue it might actually be more common maybe the note is particularly susceptible
Android,not_removed,looks like it was high enough
Android,not_removed,yeah it kind of is this is unacceptable people could die because of this im so fucking sick of the apologists here phones do not need to be catching fire period
Android,not_removed,imagine if that was a car instead of a phone
Android,not_removed,looks like it was high enough
Android,not_removed,im sure the description is truthful
Android,not_removed,oneplus one doesnt use usbc micro usb is well developed and you rarely run into problems however type c is still new and there are a lot of cables out of spec that can lead to dangerous situations nathan k and benson leung usually conduct tests on usb c products giving warnings and recommendations
Android,not_removed,if you have been following some of the discussion here in randroid and on various sites and forums there have been several different issues with typec chargers and cables there is a lot of stuff out of spec right now
Android,not_removed,youre right but consider a cheap no name charger with super thin wiring or some internal design prone to shorting the mains with the dc circuit in that case if your phone doesnt catch fire id be surprised
Android,not_removed,a brand new phone though just from charging id understand if the battery had been old or if it was in a heated area or being heavily used while charging but not just on its own
Android,not_removed,so you are saying that you are a year old schoolboy by insulting people that you will never meet over internet for no reason whatsoever to raise your very very very weak selfesteem
Android,not_removed,thats great do you have a source linkcitation i can read what pdos does it support ive got a bunch of chargers id like to try on it if thats the case
Android,not_removed,yeah if you have a source for that it would be fantastic ive been terrified to use anything except the stock charger and usb cable even though i have some bensonapproved aukey usbc to usba cables and i want to buy more quick chargers
Android,not_removed,anything on bensons amazon list is ok anything usbif certified is ok my recommendations usbc charger dodocool usbpd multiport charger anker powerport with usbpd cc cable or scosche or any other usbif certified atoc cable any one on bensons list or any other usbif certified
Android,not_removed,these things happened before fast charging was even a thing
Android,not_removed,lol none of that is even true
Android,not_removed,that only shows that marketing works better than quality or price for general public marketing simply beats common sense
Android,not_removed,cool story brah
Android,not_removed,facts more like pushing out xenophobia
Android,not_removed,some koreans reported on social media that the phone explodes without charging although not sure how accurate its probably one of the reasons why samsung stopped shipments of the note not sure about all the downvotes
Android,not_removed,im kind of out of the loop but i keep seeing people mentioned the note having some usb c issue whats the problem with it
Android,not_removed,they didnt even halt sales
Android,not_removed,most fires happen because of cheap party accessories most commonly it happens in phones with cheap party batteries being used
Android,not_removed,thats less not too bad if you ask me
Android,not_removed,lol ok lets see you make one that doesnt the fact is that if you make batteries this strong and this thin theres gonna be some fires its just physics
Android,not_removed,im not an apologist but endda said that there have been reports of catching fire samsung has probably already sold a few million of them thats of all phones catching fire should it be phones catching fire yes but is easily within margin of error for quality control also dont insult me little boy it makes you look like a dick
Android,not_removed,shut up you will upset the apologist fanboys for using rational
Android,not_removed,imagine if this was
Android,not_removed,a times b equals c if c is lower than the cost of recall then we dont do them
Android,not_removed,like happens all the time hell car companies know of defects with simple cheap fixes and hide them
Android,not_removed,worldwide sales have not been halted and there was no reason given for halting shipping in that one country it could have been anything like production issues
Android,not_removed,i charged my phone with a usbc from tykomitech® which is a reputable brand sold by aliexpress i plugged it in to charge and tucked it into my blanket for the night around i woke up to a burning sensation on my forearm and my brand new note was burning up i quickly grabbed a cup of water and dropped the phone in to help it cool down thats when the charging cable sparked screen went off and the distinct smell of burning semiconductors hit me wtf amsung waterproofing my ass im never buying a shitsung ¡
Android,not_removed,with as hot as my stock charger gets i wouldnt be surprised if something did catch fire occasionally it literally burns you finger when touching it
Android,not_removed,found the sammyboi
Android,not_removed,and even reputable brands like anker are having trouble with it
Android,not_removed,actually happens quite a bit i work for a carrier store and we have at least device thats overheated per month to the extent of a burnt out charge port that was charred while i havent seen anything this bad in my years there did have a guy mistake his phone for a ham sandwich and put it in the microwave fused right to the spinning glass plate
Android,not_removed,im just saying these are all oneoff cases do the math every phone has a video or article about one or few in thousands or millions catching fire it happens for various reasons it sucks and im not refuting this guys claim but comments like whatever manufacturer sucks because of this are just fucking retarded pretty certain youre not supposed to charge any lithium battery unattended anyway especially overnight thats a bit of common sense that most people for whatever reason seem to adamantly ignore
Android,not_removed,how do we even know its a sec video after the fact this guy could have lit it on fire
Android,not_removed,no im saying that the company isnt at fault for lithium ion batteries combustion however youre simply too stupid to realize that all lithium ion batteries have the potential to catch fire this will happen with any phone
Android,not_removed,heres the test on the exynos version of note the site is in chinese
Android,not_removed,i am a very strong supporter of ankerthen again anker and aukey look like they often buy the same generic shit and put there name on it side note have you are anyone found a decent screen protector for the yet
Android,not_removed,awesome thank you type c cables seem awesome except for the part where they could easily fry everything expensive that i own thisll help a lot
Android,not_removed,i know i had a samsung omnia thats battery started to expand not explode but because fast charging deliverys higher amps to the battery this causes heat which accelerates the aging of the cell and amplifies any defects even the most minor like the seal not being adhered completely by just a hair
Android,not_removed,yea it is but what ever you say qc has a safeguard where it throttles at then throttles again at but still pushing power into a battery that rapidly from causes the battery to deteriorate quicker both because of the rapidness of it and the heat that is created ps the explosion thing was kind of a joke though explosion with this batteries is more likely due to the heat
Android,not_removed,that has no bearing on what i said i didnt say why they sold more only that more sold more defects at the same defect rate
Android,not_removed,a photo of the burnt note that i was talking about showing the usb cable adapter used make of that what you will imo the usb cable looks cheap as heck
Android,not_removed,considering you live in america based on your comment history i dont think you have any credibility in this argument at all you cant tell me what i see in our streets isnt fact and all you need to do the same for china is to look at photos and videos of shenzhen
Android,not_removed,im not saying its true but it seems ridiculous to just dismiss it
Android,not_removed,that idea just came to mind considering that its got usbc now and weve been hearing a lot about bad cables considering that we havent seen a similar amount of issues with the nexus and oneplus phones which have had usbc for a while there might be something wrong with the new note in particular
Android,not_removed,they they dont need to be making them this strong and thin or they need to use proprietary chargers that are electronically signed to the phones either way its fucking unacceptable
Android,not_removed,also dont insult me little boy it makes you look like a dick should take your own advice there mate
Android,not_removed,the horror
Android,not_removed,clever
Android,not_removed,why were they tucking it in great thing to do with a phone that gets super hot when charging
Android,not_removed,thanks i missed that description they basically did everything wrong first they used a cheap cable put phone under blanket while charging wtf then dropped it in water still connected to the charger
Android,not_removed,was the phone delicious did the ham sandwich reach full charge
Android,not_removed,wait do people normally microwave ham sandwiches
Android,not_removed,yeah true the context of your response to him matter to and i overlooked that my bad
Android,not_removed,samsung is a big fat mess
Android,not_removed,while thats true i dont see why hed do that to a new phone you were also talking as if this isnt a concerning case since other phones have caught fire when this phone has recently released
Android,not_removed,you know that fanboyism is treatable right
Android,not_removed,they cropped out what charger and i cant see if its usbpd they might have confused for usbpd and their math is off thats not a valid voltage level thats a voltage level i require more data
Android,not_removed,try out the jetech tempered glass one im using it with the spigen neo hybrid case and its been working out great its cutouts are made to be case friendly might be the best glass screen protector out in general havent seen any oil slicks or rainbow effects either without any noticeable sensitivity issues theres also a video review of it on youtube or if you want a plastic one ive heard the iq shieldskinomi matte ones are good i personally had the zagg one before the jetech tempered glass protector and it was working well
Android,not_removed,i tried a lot and hated everything even the official samsung one its either they dont stick too long at the edges or if they do tpu using the s pen leaves marks and dont bother on finding a tempered glass one its the same issue with the edge
Android,not_removed,actually fast charging uses only about its higher voltage instead of the standard usb fast charging may degrade the battery faster but theres no real studies showing one way or another
Android,not_removed,except that using fast charger or regular charge actually heats up your phone the same
Android,not_removed,gotta wonder why not use the one that comes in the box hah
Android,not_removed,i live in the us but im in hong kong right now its the same here take a look at this picture i took a couple of days ago those are hk prices is so those price tags are and of course includes tax i wouldnt trust any of them httpsiimgurcomzpvnopcjpg
Android,not_removed,ahh okay thanks yeah ive only just recently started looking the note news so i hadnt even heard about the usb c issues until now
Android,not_removed,yo anyone wanna clue him in on the chance of dying on the road or just dying in general i think he might have the most ironic heart attack ever from it so we should probably not
Android,not_removed,but the children who will think of the children
Android,not_removed,that wasnt the description for the video it was a joke p
Android,not_removed,but everything else in that description seemed ok to you lol
Android,not_removed,woosh
Android,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about lmao
Android,not_removed,tf you talking bout bro ive been with android since honeycomb
Android,not_removed,first ive ever heard of it trust me when i say you see and hear a lot of weird stuff when you work for a carrier
Android,not_removed,i hope not
Android,not_removed,someone on the oneplus sub cracked their screen so they detonated the battery to try and scam oneplus out of a new phone
Android,not_removed,to make this video no i wasnt liar
Android,not_removed,this isnt fanboyism this is reality and facts lithium ion batteries are highly flammable look it up this has happened with every single phone ever including yours
Android,not_removed,love how all of a sudden only when its defending randroids current baby the galaxy note fanboyism and insults are upvoted and completely alright
Android,not_removed,theres a longer thread where the macbook charger is used but i cant seem to find it right now
Android,not_removed,i agree i found a semi decent one it was only you get and it feels pretty nice even with the s pen but like you said the edges dont stay down
Android,not_removed,quick charging had power levels and depending on the percentage of your battery a volt option was there but i cont really fin out what it is for that being said standard phone chargers now quick charge output at or depending on your phone so both are true there is a voltage and a amperage increase that said qc does some weird things with the voltage and not the amperage so yes sure you are right and i was referring the the heat output causing issues which is normally during the charging part
Android,not_removed,what crack are you smoking dudeyour phone gets substantially hotter when fast charging the amount of articles and forum posts up that ass about it
Android,not_removed,exactly i only made my initial comment because i had already seen this photo and its very likely that this cable is very cheap i had assumed other people had seen this too but i guess i was wrong
Android,not_removed,cable length is one reason also keeping multiple chargers instead of having the one and moving it around with you that cable could well me from their previous samsung phone and not actually a problem
Android,not_removed,they do look like they can make nice drapes though
Android,not_removed,imagine if this was your child that caught fire
Android,not_removed,omg i cant even tell anymore someone tucking in their phone was believable when people can be as stupid as i was in believing that
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,exactly
Android,not_removed,sorry i thought you were the other commenter
Android,not_removed,still unnecessary to insult him just because his opinion doesnt line up with yours
Android,not_removed,always glad to see the only adequate person cheers not glad to see kids buying overpriced crap because marketing hype
Android,not_removed,thanks the macbook only does and i dont think could handle it is highly unlikely
Android,not_removed,for the meantime im yoloing it i really hate how filmtpu feels so far havent seen any scratches for the weeks ive had it i am using a case that doesnt allow the screen to touch the flat surface when faced down so theres that just gotta be careful of wiping the screen when theres dust or sand zi guess
Android,not_removed,it was my understanding that does and does and
Android,not_removed,i tested it on a few devices last month and the heat generated is the same
Android,not_removed,holy shit
Android,not_removed,hurr durr ive got nothing intelligent to say back so ill pretend my point was proven
Android,not_removed,theres no opinion on whether lithium ion batteries are prone to combustion they are
Android,not_removed,really downvotes for calling out the insults is samsung paying this sub to just forego the rules as long as it speaks positively of the note wow
Android,not_removed,heres another post where they test it with more usbc pd chargers again information is rather limited as well
Android,not_removed,yea i feel like scratchgate was over blow it really does looks like material transfer as corning said kinda like when the metal of a pan scratch on the metal of the stove its a bitch to get off but nothing an alcohol swab cant do
Android,not_removed,i was looking at the qualcomm site for the info i gave you i am searching for the pdf i was looking at and cant find it ill get back to you with that sorry qc would be better because it can adjust its voltage on the fly byi believe it was increments
Android,not_removed,okay well were are your study results do you have a graph marking the temperature of the phone at various intervals of time what method did you use to measure the temperature at which the phone reached doing charging how many phones did you actually sample did you have a control group if is so how many if you are going to come at me with tests that you conducted i want to see your results that prove that all these other tests are lies that qualcomm is lying and manufactures are lying on there faq pages i would love to see this nothing pleases me more then defrauding corporations and people
Android,not_removed,his opinion on shitty samsung phones
Android,not_removed,ok thats a twinkietotalphase youve convinced me this is the exynos variant im guessing it looks like it is using the profile i cant be sure i cant read chinese and am using google translate however is no longer a necessary usbpd profile it got dumped in favor of in im curious if it can make full use of the profile on new chargers or you said it worked with an apple charger so that suggests it can hm httpwwwgtrustedcom should have a report soon im very interested edit ps none of those usbpd supplies was power rules compliant they need to have support for all lower voltages ie so i cant tell which profile they are using
Android,not_removed,qualcomm says that their qc doesnt hurt the phones batteries at all a quick charge operates within the design parameters of batteries found in most smartphones it is just charging the battery the way it is designed to be charged device manufacturers build smartphones with a specific battery that can accept a specific level of charge the battery size and maximum current of each battery are design decisions made by the manufacturer and can vary from smartphone to smartphone tablet to tablet and so on however traditional battery charging technology does not come close to the full power requirements of todays large batteries quick charge is designed to allow device manufacturers to achieve the full rated capability of the batteries they choose while still meeting the performance and safety standards set by the battery manufacturer
Android,not_removed,what the note isnt a shitty phone if they made shitty phones why do they have the highest market share out of any cellphone maker on the planet and i was talking about his belief that samsung phones are shitty because lithium ion batteries combust
Android,not_removed,says nothing about heat in here qualcomm has talked about the phone getting hotter during qc in an faq still waiting on those test results doc
Android,not_removed,theres no evidence to support the notion that users would notice any negative effects associated with constantly using quick charge over the average life span of a smartphone which is a little over two years as long as were all still using lithiumion batteries in smartphones the potential for anything negative to happen with your battery is no different with quick charge than it is through any other charger which is to say next to zero as long as the battery isnt being abused from an android central post
Android,not_removed,still waiting for something that says anything about heat and your super scientific study
Android,not_removed,ive been waiting for you to prove your point no where does anything say that quick charge will hurt the capacity or life span of the battery
Android,not_removed,let me first say if fast charging wasnt bad for your battery then what is the point of samsung adding a switch to shut it off quick chargers can generate more heat the more power you push through a device the more stress it puts on a battery and the more heat it generates while quick charge devices are built to be safe they can still get quite hot for the last two days ive tested the motorola turbo charger on the moto x each time i used the turbo charger it got considerably hotter than it would from the normal charger while this isnt catastrophic excessive heat isnt exactly good for the longterm health of your phone either breaking the rule of law and forcing ultrafast charging adds stress even if the battery is designed for such a purpose httpbatteryuniversitycomlearnarticleultrafastchargers htc pr has also confirmed the one doesnt support qualcomms quick charge feature this could also be a feature htc chose to disable to possibly prolong the life of their nonremovable battery charging lithiumion batteries too quickly can permanently reduce the battery capacity portions of the energy storage structure are thereby destroyed and deactivated these structural changes have been visualized for the first time the fluorescence studies show that even after only a few charging cycles damage to the inner structure of the battery material is clearly evident damage which takes longer to arise during slower charging however lithium batteries degrade over time and this process is sped up at higher temperatures especially by the ambient temperature increase caused by charging not to mention actually using your device which also generates heat its one of the reasons why its beneficial to use a low amperage charger for overnight charging as faster charging causes a greater increase in battery temperature phones with qualcomm quick charge support have a special circuit in them that reduces the high voltage coming out of the charger to something that the battery can handle this generates heat inside the phone – heat that might slow down the phones cpu and gpu and that could slow down the charging process on top of that exposing a battery to excess heat is a surefire way of reducing its lifespan fast charging uses battery charging technology that charges the battery faster by increasing the charging power galaxy ta charger most of previous devices ta charger as a result when charging the galaxy by fast charging feature temperature of the charger connector part may rise during charging until about battery capacity because charging speed increases rapidly temperature is known to have a significant impact on the performance safety and cycle lifetime of lithiumion batteries from our analysis we can see that increasing the operating temperature increases the degradation rates of all components in the lib which include maximum charge storage capacity the effectiveness of the lco electrode in storing liions charge transfer rate constant heres a reddit chain about the same shit an android central discussion
Android,not_removed,atrocious well i dont see whats wrong with it seriously its got pretty useful features and is easy to use im sure huawei aims these phones to be something anyone can pick up and use it without a hassle the reason why i believe they made emui so much like ios
Android,not_removed,can you change it do you have a screenshot to share
Android,not_removed,edit due to the bad default lockscreen i use next lockscreen
Android,not_removed,a sort of control center like toggles i find them very useful when i need to access the calculator calendar camera and flashlight within seconds anyways i see on your flair you have a hows it hanging ive been considering the or honor
Android,not_removed,honor owner here hate that lockscreen
Android,not_removed,i think this is a chinese ui thing and probably due to desire to mimic ios i have a mi and its probably my only real gripe with the entire phone edit chinese ui
Android,not_removed,thanks
Android,not_removed,could use next lockscreen it gives you more options
Android,not_removed,i dont like using party lockscreens they dont always work right
Android,not_removed,you think someone with access to an unrevealed phone would record with something better than a patato
Android,not_removed,thats one beautiful device i hope the rumours about the prices are not true
Android,not_removed,so does it look like it might have better sides to grab it on now so your palm doesnt touch the screen this is the case with my edge and i hate it
Android,not_removed,i dont know if i get or like the curved screen im not talking about the edge but the screen display itself looks like it has rounded corners ala httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomflyperinccornerflyhlen
Android,not_removed,so there has been a million leaks of this phone from different sources how does that work does that mean i can buy one off some schmuck before release
Android,not_removed,i really hope the note brings back the hardware buttons on the bottom
Android,not_removed,aw man they got rid of the hardware buttons
Android,not_removed,looks like no fingerprint sensor in the back there is still hope that itll be behind the screen
Android,not_removed,poetaytoe
Android,not_removed,phones are so impressive now a days but the leaks are always shitty and blurry i smell conspiracy
Android,not_removed,ffs came here to say the same thing vertical video in terrible quality and both phones have cases on them so you cant see them properly he shouldnt have even bothered taking a video
Android,not_removed,and last more than a few secs
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,it seems to be a trend the lg also has rounded corners and from early reports most people seem to like it
Android,not_removed,isnt that a case
Android,not_removed,its there
Android,not_removed,um no its there by the rear camera
Android,not_removed,mash em boil em stick em in a stew
Android,not_removed,definitely conspiracy samsung probably releases these leaks to build up attention
Android,not_removed,sorry i meant i dont see it that clearly so i have hope it could go either way
Android,not_removed,just like the iphone leaks that was totally intentional because of the headphone jack
Android,not_removed,sarite

Android,not_removed,highly recommend switching to snapseed and vsco those will fit your needs perfectly
Android,not_removed,are you sure it is this app on the play store it has quite a good rating and not many people complaining about this
Android,not_removed,its a chinese app what did you expect even on the play store you need to research what you download highly recommended staying away from apps based out of china if for nothing else but privacy yes that includes things like es file explorer and dolphin browser
Android,not_removed,what a disgrace
Android,not_removed,yeah this seems to be happening more and more i found i had somehow acquired one of these cancerous lock screens and just uninstalled a bunch of apps until it went away
Android,not_removed,this happened to me too after just downloading the app and using it for the first time i uninstalled it right away
Android,not_removed,this bullshit happened with the photogrids app too instant uninstall
Android,not_removed,i knew there were apps out there that would pay you to view ads on your lockscreen i used to have one but you made money so slowly it was just too much of a pain to bother but i didnt know apps could do that without it being the express point of the app s photo editor doesnt sound anything like an app who should be able to do this kind of thing google really shouldnt allow this
Android,not_removed,they said in the comments that you can disable the charging screen with the ads in the app settings
Android,not_removed,snapseed is where its at
Android,not_removed,aviary is my personal favorite in conjunction with snapseed
Android,not_removed,switch to something like solid explorer its better to lose some functionality you shouldnt lose anything with solid tho it has more features than staying on an app thats hogging down your phone and probably selling your data
Android,not_removed,another for solid explorer its much better than es and it looks a million times better too
Android,not_removed,used to love that app until one day i plugged in my and got a charging notification from the app uninstall
Android,not_removed,its like these companiesdevs dont realize their app is not the only one that has those functions
Android,not_removed,saw the comment and this was part of the developers reply could you please give stars to us on google play and they seem to have no plans on making the ads less instrusive reading more replies they recommend becoming a vip as well to remove all the ads
Android,not_removed,true but strangely they didnt show up for me
Android,not_removed,ive always heard great things about solid explorer i currently have fx and i was wondering what the difference is between the two one of my complaints about fx is that its a bit of a pain with zip files you have to copypaste the files to a unzipped folder unless im doing it wrong
Android,not_removed,yeah its pretty disgusting you should be a vip not to get ads please rate us stars yeah no
Android,not_removed,may be region based
Android,not_removed,it is perfectly acceptable to ask for vip to remove ads it is a complete horseshit to show intrusive ads and ads when app is not running so screw them
Android,not_removed,probably
Android,not_removed,where are you located
Android,not_removed,i agree but what is disgusting is that they want stars for their free version because their paid version doesnt have intrusive ads if anything this free version should be removed from the store at no point should any app be allowed to inject a new lock screen or ads on top of your existing lock screen without prior permission
Android,not_removed,yeah screwing with unrelated parts of your phone like changing your lockscreen or showing ads when not using the app are completely unacceptable
Android,not_removed,poland but my account is set to uk since it was created while i was there i get access to uk only apps such as bbc iplayer edit proof of comments for people who are doubting this post httpiimgurcomsjqyotcpng thought the screenshot would be enough to be honest
Android,not_removed,man i really hate it when people just throw around the term circlejerk because they dont agree with the preferences of others
Android,not_removed,having never heard of it a quick wikipedia read tells me that its patented thus companies have to pay the patent holder licensing fees its difficult to manufacture so as with most things in business it comes down to money
Android,not_removed,igzo and ips refer to different things you can have an igzo ips panel igzo is the semiconductor used in the backplane ips is the display technology
Android,not_removed,most high end phone tft screens are ltps its a superior technology to igzo
Android,not_removed,i think the xperia premium might have had one because the only panel that i know of was
Android,not_removed,the next step for lcds is quantum dot displays
Android,not_removed,i thought apple was doing igzo any chance the pixel phone will have it
Android,not_removed,cost
Android,not_removed,it is a circlejerk you cant deny it people act like its the end all of display technology i personally would love it if htc released a flagship with an oled display
Android,not_removed,this is basically the main reasonings lower yield rates compared to traditional ips displays and having to license the technology is the major barrier from it being used a lot also ips displays have a better viewing angle and better color reproduction
Android,not_removed,sharp is the one making them if i recall correctly
Android,not_removed,tft technology also requires a license so does ips technology it doesnt stop you from making your own you can always do your own rd and call it something else patents only apply to domestic competitors
Android,not_removed,traditional
Android,not_removed,and btw oled is the future the idea of using filters over a backlight seems downright arcane individually lit pixel technology like oled is what the majority of displays will be like in the future
Android,not_removed,til well apparently its only superior in cost
Android,not_removed,this was after the and the just ips
Android,not_removed,that has nothing to do with the lcd thats just the backlight
Android,not_removed,thats not a criclejerk thats called preference this is the exact same problem you had on your last post regarding oled screens and thats the reason everyone on that thread shat on you apparently you learnt nothing there
Android,not_removed,i mean i understand the the advantages of oled but there are also disadvantages that people simply refuse to admit here yes color accuracy isnt that much of an issue anymore but please dont be in denial about burnin its is a fact it happens on every single oled display yet somehow whenever theres talk about burn in all i see are people claiming that theyve owned every single galaxy device since the galaxy s yet some how have never even had a single pixel of burn in moreover the people who actually have burn in are simply downvoted to the bottom even worse are the same people who try to invalidate other peoples burn in issues by making false blanket statements that new oleds dont have an issue of burn in anymore even in response to someones burn in issues
Android,not_removed,well thats cause compared to plenty of lcds it is latest oled displays are perfectly accurate brighter than most lcds they have infinite contrast the best sunlight contrast and readability more efficient than lcd every generation sees huge gains over the last i think of all the things to circle jerk over this was a fine one to pick
Android,not_removed,you still need ips or tn or va display technology igzo is just the backplane semiconductor your igzo display can still be ips the issue here is that ltps used in phones is arguably better
Android,not_removed,they are but the patent owner is japan science and technology agency jst sharp and samsung both have license agreements
Android,not_removed,lol are you suggesting as a cost effective way around a patent to develop an alternative from scratch
Android,not_removed,i dont know what youre saying most laptops with igzo displays are ips panels you still need a display technology regardless of what your backplane is with lcd your choices are still ips va and tn
Android,not_removed,even some oled display use filters though samsung style of oled would have awful fields at huge sizes so they use filters instead
Android,not_removed,oled is the present not the future
Android,not_removed,inferior in cost superior in energy efficiency
Android,not_removed,posted apr
Android,not_removed,not its not the backlight changes to a blue light but the rest if the tech is different
Android,not_removed,the thing is that we have trillions and trillions of pixels on oled screens everywhere the variance of oled lifetime even between identical models is just huge its crazy people here would just assume the manufacturing process ends up producing the exact same screen a billion times and then make generalisations based on their couple of devices
Android,not_removed,everyone knows they burn in you can still have a year old phone without it though the reason people get annoyed by the burn in argument is because in reality its not an issue samsung have used them since the start and are praised every year despite this weakness in the tech its virtually irrelevant
Android,not_removed,ive seen horrific burn in on display units in stores however after owning different devices with oled none of them have burn in same thing with my plasma though there is definitely temporary image retention there
Android,not_removed,it is cynical to accuse people of being in denial of or actively lying about their burn in experiences not only is burn in subjective to ones use of the phone some people may use their phone in a way that lends itself to easily viewable burn in but the visibility of burn in is subjective in other words im sure some people just doesnt have the visual acuity or perceptiveness to see its not a circlejerk but the reality that peoples experiences with burn in are very real and very different and frankly the technology has gotten to a point where its below enough of a population threshold that the technology is viable in the market
Android,not_removed,brighter i just dont get this part of the reason i bought the is because of the insane praise it got and found myself disappointed by its brightness where are these amoled panels with insane brightness i know the can become bright outdoors on autobrightness but i use my phone of the time indoors thats when i want extra brightness and the was one of the dimmest phones ive ever used
Android,not_removed,ah thanks for that clarification
Android,not_removed,yes lg use filters over a white led for their oled tvs its a compromise for now but ultimately they will all be working towards individually lit subpixels
Android,not_removed,well apple will be using it next year the two biggest phones on the market will use it and be praised for the best brightnest displays available a alternative to lcd that is seemingly better in every way sounds like the future to me
Android,not_removed,thats just the lcd youd save more by letting through more light
Android,not_removed,if you read it says these panels will be available in
Android,not_removed,my point exactly
Android,not_removed,i dont know what to tell you but it is statistically one of the brightest displays helped further by low reflectivity and high contrast the note can reach nits given the right conditions sure you dont have a fake p
Android,not_removed,its still individually lit whole pixels it just doesnt use the sub pixel method atm could be a while before it happens as well hasnt hurt them much potentially a bit less efficient still the best tv ive seen
Android,not_removed,two brightest phones they use lcds
Android,not_removed,reading is something i didnt do in this case well derp
Android,not_removed,in the right conditions pretty sure thats the issue right there it can only cross the nits barrier when the majority of pixels are black that doesnt happen often in most conditions theyre simply dimmer and on any nonsamsung phone theyre dimmer than a good ips period
Android,not_removed,outdoors not indoors ive never used the note but the indoors on manual brightness just isnt that bright
Android,not_removed,will im talking about the future oled is already praised as best and that will continue as more and more companies move to it and it improves which is not happening at the same speed with lcd being relatively stagnant samsung doubled their oled shipments in as it gains popularity with other oems oled is the future on both mobile and tv with lg forecasting tripled sales in for oled tvs
Android,not_removed,display mate said the brightness on the homescreen is just basically garbage worth swapping for an ips so i can get that worse power usage and no blacks or sunlight visibility
Android,not_removed,it can reach well over nits indoors thats as bright or brighter than the iphone
Android,not_removed,leds are the future oled is just a stopgap
Android,not_removed,never said any of that
Android,not_removed,thats just not true on manual it reaches you can look it up on auto outdoors in sunlight it can reach around
Android,not_removed,oled is still led ill assume u mean lcd using your logic lcd is just a stop gap to what is afterwards unless lcd tech has something up its sleeve it will be eclipsed and replaced by oled
Android,not_removed,in most conditions theyre simply dimmer not true and on any nonsamsung phone theyre dimmer than a good ips period yh moto z only gets to nits
Android,not_removed,from display mate the highest non auto brightness they recorded was nits with auto that rises to over nits none of that accounts for higher contrast and low reflectivity that improve image clarity further
Android,not_removed,i meant led oled is organic led
Android,not_removed,again never said any of the gotta ditch my amoled because ips is brighter stuff mi gets to nits without software mods like overdrive
Android,not_removed,and the rest of my comment
Android,not_removed,its only
Android,not_removed,so
Android,not_removed,lcds are easier to make bright at lower resolutions
Android,not_removed,apocalypse no electricity no phone no apocalypse survival apps
Android,not_removed,my huge offline porno collection and solar panel will let me live like a king exactly like the south park ep where the internet was cut off
Android,not_removed,gasoline generator charging cell phone for as long as you can siphon gas and even w no coverage if you and others have a mesh network app like firechat you can still talk same w apps that dont require internet connection
Android,not_removed,they make solar powered cell phone chargers and kinetic powered chargers and theres always generators
Android,not_removed,well apocalypse is world ending phenomenon where nobody survives but still if the gasoline generator was in a emp blast zone then it is not usable or that most gas stations need electricity to start the pumps
Android,not_removed,solar panels
Android,not_removed,modern expensive generators come with surge protection which could negate the pulse and if the gen is turned off in a faraday cage and unplugged youve got a good chance it will survive unscathed if it was in a blast zone though youre probably looking at a melted hunk of metal as most earth based emps are related to wmds
Android,not_removed,still all are dead
Android,not_removed,i feel like i saw the exact same headline a week ago on a different site
Android,not_removed,what about the play
Android,not_removed,rip my
Android,not_removed,im starting wonder if my x is ever gonna get android n i just wanna watch videos dang it
Android,not_removed,i got it on my moto plus and so far its good
Android,not_removed,so how do you make your phone in india i bought my phone overseas and had an overseas sim ive just switched to an indian sim and checked for updates but nothing i know sometimes the update isnt immediate but im just curious what makes the phone in a certain place internet connection sim manufacturing etc
Android,not_removed,the soak test was about a month ago
Android,not_removed,i think thats more like the moto so it will probably be updated with it
Android,not_removed,could flash a rom but to be honest it is a dollar phone at launch so it does get what you pay for but nougat would be preferred
Android,not_removed,i just wanna watch videos dang it huh you need nougat for that
Android,not_removed,does the phone handle all the new features well and hows the battery life so far
Android,not_removed,you will have to flash india specific firmware from xda although that may mess up lte reception in us if you incase live there
Android,not_removed,no nougat for
Android,not_removed,yes the moto x as well as some other qhd phones stutter on playback on android m its a known issue and is supposedly fixed in android n
Android,not_removed,interested to i should be getting the plus shipped next week also notice any improvements with the overheating issue
Android,not_removed,aw well thats a bummer lenovo with their update by promise guess ill just have to wait like everyone else
Android,not_removed,there is region specific firmware so just changing region on vpn wont do it i suppose
Android,not_removed,if you bought it from india no need to flashvpn you will get the update if not bought from india region specific firmware is necessary

Android,not_removed,google safe browsing recently detected phishing on nope not going there user name deleted reported to mods
Android,not_removed,google chrome detects this a phishing website
Android,not_removed,they totally left out remixos player running android and including full google play services
Android,not_removed,uninstall the app many problems fixed
Android,not_removed,i figured this out by longpressing the notification which asked me if i wanted to hide notifications from facebook i force closed fb which vanished the notification and it hasnt returned since
Android,not_removed,solution download the beta version of the app off i would honestly just switch to facebook on chrome with notifications enabled either that or switch to swipe for facebook
Android,not_removed,why does facebook have chrome cast integration
Android,not_removed,oh my god thank you
Android,not_removed,i uninstalled the fb app a while ago and switched to the mobile web version i was recently thinking about giving it another try because maybe its gotten better glad i read this article first
Android,not_removed,use httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomnamfbwrapperhlen instead of the official app its so much better in every way
Android,not_removed,weird is it a setting in the fb app i dont see it and i have both chromecasts and i have fb installed
Android,not_removed,i posted about this issue last week and it got deleted since it was a tech support post anyway what i did was long press the notification and block all notifications from facebook
Android,not_removed,tldr uninstall the app and drop your phone in liquid nitrogen to flush out facebooks toxic remnants then bury the shattered corpse of your phone a fathom deep with a sign to warn future generations away and next time httpsfdroidorgrepositorybrowsefdfilterfacebookfdidorgindywidualnifblite
Android,not_removed,people still have the facebook app installed man i went through that huge facebook drains your battery lets uninstall phase never looked back
Android,not_removed,sigh facebook
Android,not_removed,also es file explorer on android tv is an issue with overlaying notifications when unwanted
Android,not_removed,been living in mfacebookcom for quite a while loving every second where my battery doesnt turn to shit
Android,not_removed,how to get longer battery life lower ram usage lower idle drain smoother performance in one simple step zuckerberg hates him
Android,not_removed,mbasicfacebookcom allows me to message via chrome like it is
Android,not_removed,yup and install swipe does everything the facebook app does plus more minus all the bloat and annoyance of facebook official app
Android,not_removed,and what do you suggest we replace it with all other fb apps are shit
Android,not_removed,lol i dont have friends anyway so i dont install facebook dont even know how it looks these days install allo and talk to google
Android,not_removed,how to replace facebook with an open source alternative fb whatsapp etc got there first how to dethrone them
Android,not_removed,i cant live without the features of the full blown app
Android,not_removed,deactivate facebook even more problems fixed
Android,not_removed,never have it installed in the first place ftw
Android,not_removed,it comes back next time you launch the app
Android,not_removed,chrome website with notifications enabled used to work really nice until they blocked access to the messages
Android,not_removed,thanks really wish i had looked at the comments before looking at the article there were way too many words for this
Android,not_removed,messenger lite and disable all permissions works i tried it a while back but there was no option to upload multiple photos at once right or video
Android,not_removed,videos i used it with a livestream the other day just because i could from my ipad where it works fine without weird notifications it wouldve been super handy when the debates were being streamed on fb for anyone who didnt have cable im thinking itll be good for stuff like that
Android,not_removed,theyre trying to become a mainstream video channel twitter has been streaming nfl games facebook has been streaming concacaf soccer games among other things
Android,not_removed,i dont like how swipe requires the facebook platform app permission only thing preventing me from using it i get the necessity of the permission for notifications and proper api use but its disappointing nonetheless edit im thinking of a different app entirely
Android,not_removed,it has gotten better apps have bugs and this subreddit has a strong confirmation bias for any negative news about the fb app when this is into the stable version you should consider giving it a try
Android,not_removed,it does have way more features than the web version and the overall user experience is nicer if you are if have a recent phone however it does drain battery
Android,not_removed,just are like the minority dude
Android,not_removed,its unclear to me why you would swear away an app when its experiencing buggy behavior and suggest that as a solution months later without having reevaluated it
Android,not_removed,swipe too
Android,not_removed,but the mobile web doesnt support messages i need to constantly switch chrome to non mobile identification whenever i need to read a message and thats annoying because now it has started redirecting me to the full site
Android,not_removed,i noticed negligible battery life difference between when i used the regular app and when i used tinfoil which is basically just mfacebookcom both in total battery lifescreen on time and in battery used by the app
Android,not_removed,doesnt affect battery life
Android,not_removed,minus a ton of the things the facebook app does and slower with a worse ui but yeah
Android,not_removed,use mfacebookcom does everything the mobile app does but doesnt track you preload videos or drain your battery for messaging install facebook messenger lite
Android,not_removed,ive been currently using metal pro for the last few months after hearing how bad the facebook app apparently is on battery life seems to be a decent enough replacement so far
Android,not_removed,i rarely use fb but when i do tinfoil
Android,not_removed,i used the mobile website and switched to swipe when they removed the ability to send messages from the mobile site i installed messenger lite and it seems to works fine with only a few minor bugs and the mobile site even sends notification through chrome so i almost never use swipe now
Android,not_removed,facebook lite works great for me and hasnt been a significant battery drain you have to get the apk yourself from apkmirror or wherever though
Android,not_removed,httpsmbasicfacebookcom
Android,not_removed,ive used the app several times since and it has not returned
Android,not_removed,for me it came back everytime i reconnected to my wifi which makes sense because i have chromecasts in my wifi too i just blocked all notifications from fb lol
Android,not_removed,you can download facebook messenger lite and disable all permissions works great for me
Android,not_removed,keep a tab open in desktop mode and you can message that way
Android,not_removed,rsavedyouaclick
Android,not_removed,think you replied to the wrong person
Android,not_removed,fair enough
Android,not_removed,i mean you could stream the debates from practically anywhere google play had a whole section for apps to stream the debate from it was absurd
Android,not_removed,thats very true i just ignore all of those because i just do not care about that im just here to stalk all the awkward people from high school
Android,not_removed,why is that disappointing
Android,not_removed,i believe there are similar open source wrappers out there if that sounds better
Android,not_removed,im not sure what you mean about this facebook platform app permission for all intents and purposes swipe has just about as much access to your own facebook as any browser out there which means it has none in fact it doesnt even use any of facebooks apis unlike some wrappers all that make swipe run are just some really clever workarounds which is for example what allows it to get images for notifications and have a functional widget while no other wrapper can
Android,not_removed,ive just downloaded swype for facebook what have i been doing all these years
Android,not_removed,amen to that been running swipe for a long time now and i dont miss the official facebook app at all
Android,not_removed,everyone seems to love this but it was so achingly slow that i just had to uninstall it
Android,not_removed,switched to swipe and never looked back got it on my wife phone too its awesome
Android,not_removed,if you switch to swipe and ignore the official does it still drain resources
Android,not_removed,httpsmbasicfacebookcom
Android,not_removed,should try disa for facebook messages
Android,not_removed,if you think that they dont track you through their website ive got bad news for you
Android,not_removed,or for a single website with news feed messaging try mbasicfacebookcom cc
Android,not_removed,fbml is okay until you wanna send gifs or anything other than text and likes the official fbm doesnt show up in my battery usable screen unless group chat is heavy though
Android,not_removed,which messenger lite app do you use i see several
Android,not_removed,if you still want a mobile website that can do messaging try mbasicfacebookcom
Android,not_removed,lucky you maybe it has something to do with having wifi or bluetooth turned on as well i always have both on
Android,not_removed,yea that third one was on multiple facebook live streams twitter and youtube and youtube does of course already have casting abilities it wasnt the best example my point was just that when its working properly the ability to cast from the app could be useful
Android,not_removed,because i have platform apps disabled it prevents people from sending you stupid invitations to games
Android,not_removed,i just downloaded it and youre correct im confusing your app with someone elses i modified my post to dispel any false information ill give it a spin
Android,not_removed,yeahusing a mobile wrapper is typically about slower than the normal app
Android,not_removed,and its missing features and the ui really is not great
Android,not_removed,i always had issues trying to tag more than one friend in something and found the ui not very intuitive in some areas
Android,not_removed,its worth every penny swipe is awesome not to mention the features are great
Android,not_removed,nah
Android,not_removed,a good work around is the app httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomchimborihermitcrabhlen it creates webwrapper apps for any service currently using it for amazon google and cl notifications work keeps activity out of history none of your browsing in a hermit app will be in your chrome history from the devs description no history tracking hermit does not save browsing history use hermit confidently for private browsing ad blocker no plugins required regularlyupdated block list no subscription fees no root required popup blocker do not track setting location permission asked every time no background location no background access to photos videos or files
Android,not_removed,oh sweet thanks
Android,not_removed,im using the httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomfacebookmlitehlfr but it may not be available for you i cant install it from the playstore is a link to get it on apkmirror
Android,not_removed,thanks i didnt know that a friend recently showed me that you can also use the regular m version and use the request desktop site feature on chrome and then facebook will not force you to install the app
Android,not_removed,i think it comes back ifwhen you watch a video they added cast support but i guess they havent completely figured it all out works wonderfully on ios ipad though i casted a facebook live stream the other day just because i could
Android,not_removed,i always have both on as well
Android,not_removed,honestly i barely even use the platform but the actual spam notifications im getting from chrome mobilefacebook no other site actually uses this afaik is making me thinking about blocking them so and so updated their status woo
Android,not_removed,i see i usually just block each app from sending me requests
Android,not_removed,thanks for suggesting hermit i never knew something like this existed but now im definitely checking it out how is it on permissions it wants lots of access i presume for interacting with the websites does it keep its nose out of your business they prevent fb or websites from tracking you but does hermit track anything
Android,not_removed,thank you
Android,not_removed,the description is pretty big on privacy but there is a certain amount of blind faith you need to put in the developer since those are just words there is a thread about the recent amp webpage update on the front of randroid where the dev is answering questions try him there
Android,not_removed,i always wonder about apps that supposedly enhance or provide secure connections i did find that other thread though thanks ill be reading through it soon

Android,not_removed,i ordered a robin this morning my timing is hilarious
Android,not_removed,while we have stopped selling robin and all accessories through our official channels we are still dedicated to supporting all of you we will continue to fulfill warranties for more months and as promised we will continue to provide software updates and security patches through february
Android,not_removed,well hey well still be here and if you want to read a little more
Android,not_removed,i really enjoy my robin but the writing was on the wall for months theyve shipped less than units going by play store installs for their nextbit apps
Android,not_removed,ironically the only thing i feel like is lacking on the robin is the leds this may be a match made in heaven
Android,not_removed,damn was really hoping for another phone
Android,not_removed,razer today in a stunning move has announced plans to enter the mobile phone market a spokesperson from razer had the following to say leds when asked to elaborate the razer spokesperson stated hundreds of leds thousands green everywhere
Android,not_removed,can you at least tell us what the battery thing was that you were working on
Android,not_removed,it really is a shame i would have loved to see a phone from this company
Android,not_removed,bought a pebble because they made make awesome smartwatches gets bought by fitbit bought a nextbit robin because its a cheap powerful beautiful smartphone gets bought by razor what the hell is going on with my purchase decision s
Android,not_removed,nextbit robin with nokia lights when
Android,not_removed,i would buy the fuck out of a razer phone solid black metal body with nothing but a green razer logo on the backso sexy
Android,not_removed,as a recent owner and user of robin im sad now
Android,not_removed,i fucking love the look of the next bit robin its such a pretty phone
Android,not_removed,had this phone for months one of the best phones you can buy for the price
Android,not_removed,was anyone really surprised i mean they have been lacking in hardware updates for too long now and zero announcements of any kind outside of software and maybe deals here and there over robin meh
Android,not_removed,isnt this smartphone strongly dependent on cloud services all those functions are going to be shut down
Android,not_removed,so n is coming chances it gets o
Android,not_removed,its a shame it was carrier data plans holding this cool phone back
Android,not_removed,i bought a razer mouse years ago and it was complete trash this is the second or third big acquisition by them that ive seen in the past year so they must be doing something right have razer products improved or is it just a lot of people buying mediocre products because of good marketing
Android,not_removed,now we can have razer cell phones that die in months to go along with our mice keyboards and headsets that die in months
Android,not_removed,cant wait for that robin chroma
Android,not_removed,im thinking rgb smartphones
Android,not_removed,theyre gonna make scooters now aw
Android,not_removed,ngage
Android,not_removed,so nextbit is getting rgb pcmr watercooled wait thats corsair not razer
Android,not_removed,i hope razer will let nextbit phones keep their aesthethics i just purchased a new phone but if i were to buy a phone now id seriously consider nextbit robin simply on aesthetics alone it looks stunning
Android,not_removed,cant wait for the nextbit chroma with rgb flash i will finally get proper white balance in my mancave or at an edm concert
Android,not_removed,id probably buy a razer phone as long as it has maximum rgb
Android,not_removed,chroma phone
Android,not_removed,so the next version is getting a slide out fullsize mechanical keyboard with led backlit keys
Android,not_removed,before yall run out to buy your robins before razer blesses us with the robin chroma just a little
Android,not_removed,god fucking dammit first pebble now nextbit whats next blackphone being bought by google i shouldnt give them any ideas
Android,not_removed,so were getting phones from razer now that are expensive at fuck at doesnt last long
Android,not_removed,razer omg chroma triple display cellphone guise hype traaaaain
Android,not_removed,i just wish the robin got its cdma version out i really wanted to use one
Android,not_removed,thats sad i really hoped for a badass
Android,not_removed,please let them make a slider phone with gamepad controls
Android,not_removed,my initial reaction was disappointment but this is probably the best chance nextbit had for really taking off i imagine this made some people some money too which is welldeserved
Android,not_removed,sucks because i was so damn ready to get onebeing on verizon it felt too good to be trueand then it actually turned out to be just that😔
Android,not_removed,is there a specific reason nextbit has been sold to razer is there anything we can be looking forward to after the buy by razer what does the team look forward to with this move unextbitkhang
Android,not_removed,incredible journeyd
Android,not_removed,so what exactly does this mean for a potential buyer
Android,not_removed,great all i wanted was a bigger phone with the same design i loved the design because the market has gotten so boring now well get a robin chroma for
Android,not_removed,i wonder how much razer will go after gamers with their new phone i for one would be interested to a phone with pc game streaming capabilities
Android,not_removed,they should make the back panel an led array where you can cycle through all million colour options or make patterns as you can with the keyboard lol
Android,not_removed,if razer can buy a phone start up why cant they remake the razer polo shirts
Android,not_removed,i will never again buy or even be tempted by a phone with sharp corners they are a huge pain in your trouser pocket
Android,not_removed,to be honest all i thought of was the motorola razr before clicking
Android,not_removed,pretty obvious this would happen with those insane sales on great hardware
Android,not_removed,shocker s
Android,not_removed,aw shit i was kinda banking on some sort of a robin successor announcement shame really
Android,not_removed,i wondered when razer would do this but damn nextbit is an amazing phone i hope they become better in the future
Android,not_removed,realistically this is the best thing that could have happened you dont really get small oems with this kind of product at least not for very long the margins are too tight and the bulk buying power and financial hedging needed to be competitive are just not realistic for small firms the supply and distribution networks are enormously difficult to build too being bought by a supportive larger firm with clout to take the company to the next level as an internal team obviously but still respect autonomy is the best a company and its investors can hope for its sort of like oneplus except they were never a fully separate company but oneplus succeeds because it behaves like a small company acts autonomously yet has a big daddy behind it allowing them to play with the big boys i frequently invest in small tech companies and as sad as it may seem positive takeovers are often hoped for above smalltime success there are unicorns out there but most of the time youre just happy to have your racehorse looked after at a great stable
Android,not_removed,i appreciate the early adopters who took a chance on it but the chance of some start up building a phone is so slim there are so many big companies that are bearing breaking even on it and some start up thinks theyre going to muscle in it just doesnt make sense
Android,not_removed,can you see it a razer android phone though i could see them doing a vr headset for it as competition to samsung
Android,not_removed,tactile keyboards on phones
Android,not_removed,honestly i did not even know about this phone but seeing it now i would have bought one if it was allowed onto googlefi
Android,not_removed,rgb phones incoming
Android,not_removed,time for the gamer phones regardless good to see nextbit picked up by a big company
Android,not_removed,ive owned few razer products none of them worked well swore them off completely hope the phone wont follow the same pattern that i had
Android,not_removed,i really liked the idea of the robin its sad to see it go still im more intrigued by razers place in this i know they have a smart watch and a fit bit competitor so maybe theyre moving into mobile electronics with this
Android,not_removed,i knew they wouldnt last i mean cloud storage come on right when phones received onboard it was dead
Android,not_removed,hmmm the robin comes with a year warranty but in the article it states that razor agreed to maintain a month warranty on hardware how can they legally do that for someone who bought the phone within the past months
Android,not_removed,serious question being all plastic does this not make it feel super cheap
Android,not_removed,posting this from a robin right now rip in peace
Android,not_removed,i should grab one as a beater
Android,not_removed,im hype for a razer android phone tbh
Android,not_removed,lol one phone and dead thats what happens when you create a whole company to produce a worse nexus with the structural integrity of a graham cracker
Android,not_removed,so what will happen to the cloud storage i just ordered one like last week sorry if someone asked im on mobile so i am having issues searching
Android,not_removed,i like how a lot of people buying mediocre products because of good marketing
Android,not_removed,i knew it this has always been their goal make a phone with some lame software gimmicks build hype wait for a bigger company to bail you out
Android,not_removed,that phone is crap made of cheap plastic and overpriced
Android,not_removed,fuck idk how to feel about this
Android,not_removed,i bought this phone and man is it disappointing really no surprise that they went under i wanted a smaller handset and i really should have just gone with a sony compact
Android,not_removed,i am ready for rgb frame for my phone
Android,not_removed,i bought it like shortly after the kickstarter was funded it has since had battery issues and any time i engage them on social media to ask questions its been more of them congratulating others on getting the phone and marketing here and there this is something i figured either them selling or just abandoning the phone altogether with silence it should have been a warning when the phone went from to almost on amazon edit i cant recommend this phone anymore this is disappointing
Android,not_removed,im still salty they cancelled the verizon version of nextbit
Android,not_removed,i hope theres only bright green phones in the future
Android,not_removed,im so surprised s
Android,not_removed,rip everyone who thought this cardboard ass phone was a good idea from the start
Android,not_removed,dont know why you guys make fun of razer when it comes to hardware they make the best windows laptops comparable in build quality to apple i think razer is more than capable of making a great smartphone
Android,not_removed,im offended
Android,not_removed,time to make a phone w rgb leds i can totally see razer doing this
Android,not_removed,all i can thing of when i hear this name is the guy cracking one in half with ease
Android,not_removed,what a surprise s
Android,not_removed,all employees were joining razer to work on future mobile products as part of a new unit at the company which historically has focused on pc games reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Android,not_removed,nextbit phones will break in months now
Android,not_removed,ugly and unsupported this was a cool idea but it didnt have enough same goes for zenphones chiaomis maybe next time
Android,not_removed,i got one on sunday rooted it flashed lineage os not a single bit of regret besides the fact that there will be no successor
Android,not_removed,thanks ill be here to support you as best i can
Android,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better ive been using a second hand robin for a few months now and its a great phone for the price also if you have the teal and white model get used to people asking about it its the only phone ive owned that people routinely ask about because of the designcolors
Android,not_removed,thats nothing i ordered a moto g and motorola got bought by lenovo before i got it now this thing in two months after i got the phone at least both phones seem to have good dev support in case things go bad i still have my trust in nextbit and their separation from razer though
Android,not_removed,i got my pebble the week before they announced bankruptcy there are issues with my watch and i cant use the warranty but it isnt the worst thing in the world
Android,not_removed,i bought mine about a week ago feel you brother
Android,not_removed,naked two of us i bought mine for my gf
Android,not_removed,im ordering mine soon too from a third party seller though so i should be okay
Android,not_removed,such a love hate relationship with that phone that mainly ended in hate
Android,not_removed,cancelled my order last week i got lucky
Android,not_removed,for the price i got an with much better specs item item
Android,not_removed,return it
Android,not_removed,nice flair
Android,not_removed,i cant be the only one impressed that theyve supported updates to the robin in a timely manner and plan on following through with years of software updatessupport i mean not even google does this anymore right
Android,not_removed,as a robin owner im a little bit sad about this news i really liked the idea behind the company and the phone itself fulfilling warranty for months and keeping up the promise with updates is a very good move for the people who supported you and liked your idea of smartphone the sad part is that we wont have a robin successor this is what makes me a little bit sad
Android,not_removed,does this mean android version updates until or just security patches
Android,not_removed,i just bought a robin for my mom for christmas i hope razer lives up to their promises of course the upside is that you are now part of a game hardware company and if you make something that looks like the xperia play but with updated hardware i will give you all my money
Android,not_removed,hey khang any chance this means youll be able to take advantage of razers retail channels the robin successor deserves to be on store shelves and also needs to come out soon
Android,not_removed,interesting so what does this mean for the unique cloud storage thing you integrated into the system how long will that be available to users
Android,not_removed,im scared this means youll adopt razers shitty hardcore gamer aesthetic with ugly ass edges and green everywhere
Android,not_removed,well shit can you post an official way to flash custom roms onto this thing
Android,not_removed,i was really really into the nextbit robinbut a bend test video it snapped in half scared me from it since i know i have been a bit clumsy with previous phones please guys if you continue on the smartphone department please try your best to work on a solid structure and if it manages to be a budget phone that will be a plus p i will keep a close eyes on your next projects and best of luck with razer
Android,not_removed,please release a new robin with updated specs the side fingerprint reader and updates are really really attractive
Android,not_removed,will it be able run androids os in the future
Android,not_removed,i bought a robin for my wife a few months ago and we have loved it well done
Android,not_removed,aw dang was planning on buying a robin soon
Android,not_removed,any chances for a phone this year i will be looking for a replacement at the end of the year
Android,not_removed,nextbit do you have any future plan to sell in other countries like brazil razer has an online store here
Android,not_removed,so do you think i have any reason not to grab one of your phones
Android,not_removed,yeah i cant point to why exactly but the whole package made for my favorite phone released with the gen processors it probably has something to do with design software device efficiency and a great fingerprint reader but the support was great and the dev community was active so that was awesome too if it had more than just an average camera id definitely still be using it i hope razer lets them keep doing what theyre doing for the most part
Android,not_removed,you will get another phone but with rgb lighting
Android,not_removed,wellyou never know what the future holds
Android,not_removed,same unique design and decent specs
Android,not_removed,and theyre going to be yuge
Android,not_removed,were looking at different software optimizations to increase usage of the phone under typical scenarios
Android,not_removed,from nextbits blog post it said they were going to be an independent division under razer likely theyll keep the nextbit name for its next phone and will still echo the nextbit philosophy
Android,not_removed,can you buy an amd chip they could use an investor
Android,not_removed,such is the life of a tech hipster
Android,not_removed,sane problem here
Android,not_removed,idk but dont buy anything else ever lol
Android,not_removed,since its razer it will be called the new robin and after the robin is released the robin will be called robin
Android,not_removed,thanks ill tell the product guys to get on that asap
Android,not_removed,and plenty of rgb leds on it
Android,not_removed,why the logo the razer logo sucks its like the symbol of over the top gaming products
Android,not_removed,a green razer logo on the back cringe also taking in account the quality of razer peripherals the phone wouldnt last more than a year
Android,not_removed,i like the look of razer products except for the green
Android,not_removed,that sounds disgusting
Android,not_removed,chance of dying within months chance of being indestructible thats my experience with razer
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,as someone who has used razer products since their first couple years in business i wish i could say this ive always used razer products mice headphones mouse surfaces and laptops however ive had some issues with them the past couple of years my first copperhead mouse lasted me several years before getting a deathadder that first deathadder mouse lasted me years then i got another deathadder after the first one broke from years of use that deathadder had some obvious upgrades however the left click started acting up after only months their warranty support was a joke i ended up just paying out of pocket for a third one i also got one of their headsets i forget the name of the headset but it broke months later along with the deathadder mouse to skip some more details this is my experience with razer products razer copperhead razer deathadder years and my current one has lasted nearly years razer headset forgot the name lasted months before the attached mic stopped working and left ear went out razer tiamat headset months before left ear stopped working razer blade close friend had one lasted months before it stopped working razer refused to honor warranty my point is that im cautious about razer especially after my experience with them their quality seems to go up and down for their cheaper products like mice and keyboards their high end hardware while it is a great product ive had a close friend who had a terrible experience with it while the idea of a razer phone really interests me i would be cautious about buying one especially if not were a high tier price
Android,not_removed,the black htc one was one of the sexiest phones ever theyd just need to copy that and theyre golden
Android,not_removed,it really is one of a kind in a market full of shitty designs
Android,not_removed,feels good in the hand too
Android,not_removed,people are mostly surprised that its razer there doesnt appear to be a lot of overlap in their audiences
Android,not_removed,i knew that it was inevitable but im glad that the company was successful enough to be bought up at all lots of startups go out of business entirely so to be bought up at all means that they were successful i get the feeling that it was too small and had too few resources to meet all of the goals that it set up for itself so its acquisition by razer is like a doubleedged sword it finally has the resources that a small tech company selling to a large audience needs but theres no assurance that nextbit will remain an entirely autonomous entity within the company it sucks that it couldnt survive and thrive on its own but it was also a bit naive to assume that it could have to begin with im sure that nextbits endgoal was to eventually be acquired by a larger company its just surprising that that company ended up being razer i only hope that razer wasnt a last resort for them
Android,not_removed,bend test fail by next bit robin wtf were they thinking will only using plastic
Android,not_removed,strongly i have all that disabled on mine its a neat concept but its far from a selling point
Android,not_removed,i rarely use it its not like dropbox its pretty limited i got it because it was cheap and has the bands for the current price its really hard to pass up
Android,not_removed,pretty good chancesfingers crossed
Android,not_removed,howso i have completely unlimited everything with no data caps at tmobile what is holding back my robin besides the device itself
Android,not_removed,no if unlimited plans were the norm this phone would never need to exist because google apple samsung etc would all be doing intelligent cloud syncing this phone failed because it used a gimmick that no one was asking for
Android,not_removed,i bought a razer mouse years ago and its still kicking
Android,not_removed,kids like those led lights they partner with microsoft for store front sales too
Android,not_removed,other razer
Android,not_removed,just minus the and water cooling and its razer
Android,not_removed,i just thought the specs didnt justify the price tag im sorry the product failed but i can certainly see why
Android,not_removed,same thing happened to the btw
Android,not_removed,im thinking they offered them a big pile of money
Android,not_removed,razers leds are the tackiest ones though
Android,not_removed,pebble stopped honouring warranty once they sold to fitbit likely the same way this works
Android,not_removed,worse then a how so genuinely curious i think the nextbit is better
Android,not_removed,integrating cloud storage on a system level unlike never before and present it at an appealing price devilish
Android,not_removed,it started at dollars and dropped all the way to you cant have phones for free buddy
Android,not_removed,feelgood
Android,not_removed,be salty to vzw
Android,not_removed,a lot of people hate their customer service and their products just dont last
Android,not_removed,its not even accurate like how do you fuck that up
Android,not_removed,does android pay work on lineage rather interested in using it as my bank deemed me not cool enough to get a contactless card
Android,not_removed,how did you do it when i tried to flash it twrp wasnt able to find the rom file or opengapps kept saying available
Android,not_removed,the successor will be a razer phone by the nextbit team
Android,not_removed,razer is getting into the mobile industry thats awesome you guys are getting some good backing congrats
Android,not_removed,i appreciate the continued support man certainly not knocking anything i primarily bought it cause it seems like an excellent phone just quite amusingly coincidental from my perspective
Android,not_removed,does this mean my week old robin will only have months of warranty
Android,not_removed,what do you think they plan to do will the robin still support the cloud will razer produce some phones and keep the team i hope so
Android,not_removed,whats the eta on android n i bought my nextbit robin with a promise it would be available end of
Android,not_removed,its unfortunate to hear if things change in a negative way especially if that means no robin any idea when nougat will officially get rolled out i opted into the beta program get the emails but the forum doesnt recognize my google info will robin get android o
Android,not_removed,i was thinking if getting a nextbit do you think thats still a good idea or are you guys closing down shop
Android,not_removed,will you be adding cherry mx brown keys to the next phone
Android,not_removed,i went for midnightthe white and mint just didnt really click for me yet i love seafoam green guitars go figure if mintnight was readily available though that wouldve been my goto
Android,not_removed,hows the battery performance
Android,not_removed,next time buy a samsung so they get bought by some other company
Android,not_removed,i bet you also got a pebble
Android,not_removed,your comment is the first ive heard about this ive had pebbles since the beginning but i guess i dont keep up with their news now im in a spiral of panicked research all the alternatives are garbage
Android,not_removed,i had no idea they went bankrupt
Android,not_removed,heh a year of support is more than you get for most android phones on the market even the dollar phones only get two years
Android,not_removed,not sure where youre based but the mi is a full £ more for me
Android,not_removed,i might have to get a black and green dbrand skin going for that signature razer look
Android,not_removed,plan in an acquisition everything is exciting and a great fit in a few weeksmonths see how many layoffs there are and how many updates still go out im not predicting the future just saying that they have absolutely no reason to generate bad pr by saying f you guys were shutting it the hell down
Android,not_removed,i cant be the only one impressed that theyve supported updates to the robin in a timely manner it helps when you only have one device to support and stick very close to stock in terms of ui and plan on following through with years of software updatessupport never trust an oem on things like this regardless of their past record a plan is not a promise and they might change priorities within the next years
Android,not_removed,what google had supported all their devices for years
Android,not_removed,where did you get years from
Android,not_removed,are you even aware that robin is sitting on marshmallow with september security patch last heard nougat was supposed to be out in now its not even on the horizon update for this phone has pretty much ceased for months
Android,not_removed,talk is cheap
Android,not_removed,google does year iirc
Android,not_removed,dont crythe future is bright for us
Android,not_removed,join us over at rpebble why dont you
Android,not_removed,to be fair they didnt really build anything sustainable essentially they see the potential for expansion much greater with a company who has greater assets
Android,not_removed,it means both were already working on know weve got to get our stable build out fast
Android,not_removed,i hadnt thought of this and here i am waiting for someone to make a gamepad moto mod that i could use with my z play i would buy a new xperia playlike device in a heartbeat no matter who makes it and lo and behold a game hardware company buys a phone company now you got me excited to see what comes of this
Android,not_removed,yea hopefully razer makes a phone and a damn good vr headset out of it similar to googles daydream
Android,not_removed,come to think of it p
Android,not_removed,different strokes for different folks 😄
Android,not_removed,maybe u forgot the razer laptop its freaking awesome
Android,not_removed,while i agree the rgb trend is a bit over the toprazer has one the best looking laptops next to the dell xps
Android,not_removed,dont forget falling apart in weeks
Android,not_removed,i think razer is the only company specifically targeting the gamer crowd that doesnt have a fugly design i like the look of the rgb keyboard they managed to avoid making it look like garbage
Android,not_removed,yeah check xda or our community forums for roms and methods
Android,not_removed,woot let me know if you have any questions or issues and ill do my best to help
Android,not_removed,theres always a chance but we havent determined the direction were going in yet as we still are focused on making robin perform better and adding features to it
Android,not_removed,cant wait to pay extra for that
Android,not_removed,i actually think that isnt a bad idea instead of a small notification light the entire rightor left side of the phone is a lighting panel it can be set to do things like countdown like a loading bar an improved torch a brighter notification light it can be used as a lightbar to show how much battery is left would i buy a rgb phone god no but it isnt the worst idea in an area of devices that are nearly identical
Android,not_removed,nexbits cloud logo razers snake orgy logo would be the biggest downgrade from any smartphone this year
Android,not_removed,ngl id gladly take that
Android,not_removed,and actual build quality
Android,not_removed,hopefully razer doesnt interfere too much and we dont end up with another lenovorola
Android,not_removed,well the phone is the robin so the razor robin because the razor nextbit sounds terrible
Android,not_removed,loltbh i don´t want to be a hipster it just seems the most innovative tech is the least appreciated
Android,not_removed,robin sounds peaceful and harmless a razer phone would be called something like soulsquelching decapitatr
Android,not_removed,please dont make the phone scream
Android,not_removed,in mint doh
Android,not_removed,just minus off that green logo ill take a nice subdued or maybe an rgb i could live with that but not green anything but being forced green actually no rgb thatll kill the battery no logo at all just all black metal construction with ridiculous specs sd card reader espresso machine gift card printer also a camera with a display on the front for the ultimate in vr experience and flip out screens to really get my game on when i play mario run k thanks
Android,not_removed,tell the product guys that other people are tired of metal phones and still think soft touch plastic is the best material
Android,not_removed,dammit uafghanninja see what youve done
Android,not_removed,keep the plastic though the design is unique and thats why that phone is awesome keep designing something unique and youll always be appreciated for it im actually looking to get rid of my please dont bootloop in favor of a robin to test out the waters keep up the good work
Android,not_removed,the phone industry is fierce as you probably know razer absolutely has to have a quality product wit flagship specs if they want their image to project on this market and btw fast os updates and at least an option to have stockish android would be nice
Android,not_removed,if theres no green logo an etched silvergray would be dope
Android,not_removed,from a gamer that has used many products razer is one of the very few companies that keeps my attention and business i have had a sabertooth controller since it hit the market and when the wildcat was released for xbox one i grabbed it without second thought two months in and its better than the sabertooth and miles ahead of all other controllers for xbox ive used if your not a serious or competitive gamer then stick with the afterglow controllers and madcatz peripherals if you want high quality of recommend razer first for all categories then official controllers and turtle beach audio but personally razer has yet to do anything that annoys me other than their april fools products being ridiculously fake
Android,not_removed,well i hate it because of personal experience well my girlfriends personal experience she bought a razerblade for dollars from razer and the keycap fell out so she sent it in and had it fixed with warranty then the fan had issues so they swapped out her ssds then she sent it in and they swapped the fan but they returned it with missing screws when they returned it it was out of the year warranty and told her to repair it by sighing up for more warranty and thats my story why i hate razer similar thing happened to a friend with a razerblade
Android,not_removed,really cringe its not like its a bad logo people who arent into gaming wouldnt recognize it i think that aesthetic would be great like the
Android,not_removed,thats interesting i have owned multiple razer peripherals and they havent broken on the other hand i have had steelseries mice and a steel series headset break and have had hyperx cloud headsets break writing this on my razerblade which is working just fine i associate razer with good build quality
Android,not_removed,razer is eager to break into any market they can and apparently have the cash to do so theyve been making wearables for a while now no idea if they sell at all and had a first foray into android with the android tvbased razer forge which basically failed they also acquired thx last year and ouya in
Android,not_removed,getting acquired is not necessarily a successful exit monetarily for its founders and early employees which hold shares that are typically lower in payout priority than creditors and venture capitalists
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,im assuming you dont play many fps or rts the sealclear coatwhatever it was on mine completely wore off the finger pads and the left click popped up and had times the travel distance it should
Android,not_removed,so most likely people would have to go through their credit card warranty system if a problem arises
Android,not_removed,and still its shite pronouce with french accent
Android,not_removed,inc
Android,not_removed,could this buyout help bring the robin to cdma specifically sprint now that nexus is dead i cant wait to see what your next gen phone offers
Android,not_removed,im salty to both i hate verizon but am disappoint they cancelled the phone
Android,not_removed,products as in mice and keyboards right because i never heard a complaint about their laptops not lasting cause you know theyre well built
Android,not_removed,you should look into other banks
Android,not_removed,i dont think banking apps and definitely not android pay work on rooted apps
Android,not_removed,you might be able to load the rom and opengapps zips on a flash drive and use a usb c to female a cable called otg in the past with micro usb twrp should see the flash drive then
Android,not_removed,hopefully but that depends on how much independence they will preserve
Android,not_removed,thanks i think the whole team is pretty stoked
Android,not_removed,razer like razer of the lets put the most obnoxious leds we can find on everything within out reach fame because im not sure how i feel about a super stealth gamerz xxx ulra led phone
Android,not_removed,cannot wait for my first rgb phone
Android,not_removed,rgb leds in every phone all over the place
Android,not_removed,i havent read of these phones before could you explain why you think they are awesome
Android,not_removed,well still support robin through february so that would mean security updates and possibly os updates
Android,not_removed,what is or isnt a good idea isnt for me to determine for you 🤣 this phone is still getting a ton of support is inexpensive and still turns heads you can weigh that in your decision making
Android,not_removed,right now were still focused on robin future products and services are still unclear
Android,not_removed,seafoam green you arent a real guitarist if seafoam green andor sonic blue arent a favorite color
Android,not_removed,im just assuming youre talking about seafoam green strats which are seriously the only thing i like that color on and holy hell do i love that color on a strat
Android,not_removed,mediocre at best but it charges fast and im in my car a lot so it rarely drops below if you are a heavy user you will likely need to charge it at some point throughout the day
Android,not_removed,dude my moto x pure just got the september security update wft lenovo this is supposed to be your flagship device where the hell are those updates you promised
Android,not_removed,galaxy actually looks good so far so 🤔 not too cheap though
Android,not_removed,nah not a fan of those
Android,not_removed,you have a point atleast a phone it will forever live with nougat at this step the will receive nougat when trump leaves the presidency
Android,not_removed,got it off aliexpress for the model cost me cad which was about american
Android,not_removed,isnt there a company that dissembles and repaints phone and laptops
Android,not_removed,you have been banned from rpebble
Android,not_removed,httpsourincrediblejourneytumblrcom
Android,not_removed,who cares about google support as long as lineage supports us were golden
Android,not_removed,the robin came out in feb and their official statement said software support until feb
Android,not_removed,i was not i saw news that there was a beta and they were working with the paranoid android team to optimize things i wrongly assumed that they had continued support and nougat was released on the robin looks like the actual details are a lot more lackluster especially if theyre still on the september security patch
Android,not_removed,robin with rgb leds all over confirmed
Android,not_removed,thats what motorola said when lenovo bought them
Android,not_removed,indeed boys it is indeed and girlz
Android,not_removed,to be fair every company says that right after theyve been bought
Android,not_removed,best of luck
Android,not_removed,pebbles story is worse than this imho warranty shut down and no more updates
Android,not_removed,the official statement has such a weird wording does this mean there will be no robin
Android,not_removed,there are already phones out there with a psp like form factor and a gamepad for the bezels the only issue is that its chinese for the life of me i cant remember what it was called
Android,not_removed,sorta razer would put leds on top of leds if they could please dont do that i seriously considered a robin when shopping and part of it was it looked a bit different without trying too hard
Android,not_removed,yeah razer blade laptops are always headturners the prettiest nonmac design on the market imo
Android,not_removed,i guess fugly design is subjective but i think everything apart from there laptops look horrible
Android,not_removed,i actually prefer httpwwwroccatorg stuff when it comes to design
Android,not_removed,steelseries and cooler master have nice keyboards with understated design even corsair is less gamer aesthetic than razer
Android,not_removed,theres hopefully going to be a httpswwwindiegogocomprojectsedgesuperchargeyournotificationscomingsoon which does just that
Android,not_removed,perhaps have it be green for battery life then every now and then switch to blue for temperature like degrees per led and turquoise or summit for precipitation chance thatd be a talking point at least maybe led patterns for contacts so if you work at starbucks a you could set a green white alternating pattern for messages and calls from your manager first common brand that popped into my head
Android,not_removed,nobody remembers had an xperia u and the led was pretty dope especially when rooted there was an app which allowed for any color instead of the pre chosen ones by sony
Android,not_removed,the samsung edge kinda does this but ive only seen limited functionality for it you can set colours for contacts and the side changes that colour if they calltext
Android,not_removed,so like sonys old light bar but with more cool shit involved id be down
Android,not_removed,snake orgy i will never look at the razer logo the same way
Android,not_removed,they had bad build quality
Android,not_removed,introducing the r λ z ξ r lancehead an all new r λ z ξ r cell phone featuring our allnew snakeos powered by android specs our all new chroma rear snake logo an all new gaming grade and last but not least rgb lights
Android,not_removed,nextbrazer
Android,not_removed,or palmwebos am i the only one who loved those phones and was disappointed they didnt do well
Android,not_removed,well they actually have a pretty consistent naming scheme mice deadly snakes mats deadly insects keyboards deadly spiders audio deadly seathings console deadly cats so nextbite soulsquelching decapitatr chroma sounds pretty plausible
Android,not_removed,thats more gskills thing razer is just coocoo for bright rgb
Android,not_removed,yoouuu got it p
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,appreciate that ill pass it along
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,unfortunate theyre blades look amazing but going to china really fucked things up i still have an year old death adder and year old naga my friends keyboard is or now and i dont hear their latest products lasting more than a year or two now
Android,not_removed,as a logo itself its a terrible edgy tribal logo and its association with the average cheap plastic crap the company produces would hurt sales
Android,not_removed,razer products seem to either break down immediately or last forever with little room in between well assuming internet stories are representative of reality of course i use a razer headset mouse and keyboard and they have all been excellent additions to my setup for years a lot of other people i know have had razer accessories that break when breathed on though
Android,not_removed,i had a orochi that would randomly cause the mouse to jump around the screen started the rma process and forgot about the email for the return shipment confirmation started it up again a year later and they were still willing to return it got the model back and i cant be happier i also have a chroma death adder and chroma kraken both great and around with no signs of wear after a year i did have a deaths talked that wouldnt turn on with my desktop worked on my bros just fine for some reason he is still using it
Android,not_removed,im the proud owner of the black widow ultimate and naga both chroma yeah come at me and they still run wonderfully after two years but dae le razer le sux and for le plebs
Android,not_removed,i had a controller and after half a year of light usage im a pc gamer so i only use it for a handful of games the stick centering was really off and the buttons started to stick
Android,not_removed,i completely forgot that they bought ouya my kickstarter edition is tucked away in my closet with two controllers gathering dust damn that thing sucked
Android,not_removed,on pc i dont ive only put around hours into csgo with this mouse plus another hours into other games so in that sense the mouse hasnt been through a lot
Android,not_removed,well were not exactly sitting on our asses doing nothing were still dreaming big dreams
Android,not_removed,the person you replied to is a netbit employee
Android,not_removed,nah its more that i got my card before they rolled out contactless ones and im too lazy to request a new one
Android,not_removed,what is your stance on rgb and led as design element
Android,not_removed,does this mean that new phones will come with dolby
Android,not_removed,im less worried about silly leds than i am about having a phone thats built to fall apart after a year
Android,not_removed,if they can make a good phone with the aesthetics of the blade prostealth then i might be sold thats some sexy hardware i do agree that their peripherals are pretty gaudy
Android,not_removed,well razer blade has a pretty restrained design it has led keyboard sure but you can simply turn it off or program all keys to white though i must say im not a fan of black matte colour theyre using for most of their devices i would prefer something white or stainless steel but its just a preference
Android,not_removed,are you crazy who wouldnt want a phone made of leds and cheap electronics
Android,not_removed,didnt they make that atrocious smart watch some time ago as well
Android,not_removed,people here love to hate on razer but their products have mid apple level build quality and actually look good you dont like the logo you can turn it off or just cover it with a black sticker who gives a fuck what their products names are i mean is it really worse than rphone or razer andromeda as i said earlier this month i would buy my razer blade stealth even if it was called sir fluffington computing terminal x about leds you know you can customize them right they dont have to be on lgbt mode all the time i fucking love them i spent hours when i first bought a razer product made typing gaming media and look how cool my keyboard is god im so lonely modes and never looked back only product i can think of that youre right about is the led mouse pad thats just stupid
Android,not_removed,they dont have ridiculous names like that though they just call it chroma
Android,not_removed,they make good laptops and theyre pretty sleek looking nice and understated albeit maybe a bit overpriced if they make a smartphone in the same veins it could turn out pretty good
Android,not_removed,then dont buy it plenty of options out there for you im sure there is demand for a phone like that
Android,not_removed,very similar hardware to the nexus at a much lower price neat cloud storage stuff a bloatfree rom and you can root and flash to your hearts content without voiding the warranty i havent actually got it yet though so i cant say for sure
Android,not_removed,i have one its actually really fast and responsive the cloud storage im sure is cool but i dont use it for the price i couldnt be happier with the phone
Android,not_removed,imo front facing speakers near stock experience unique design unlocked sim were worthwhile at this price point
Android,not_removed,i was very close to buying one but then i saw the bend test video on youtube it is the worst bend test i have ever seen the phone has no internal metal frame its all plastic and bends like a toothpick i keep my phone in my back pant pocket and often sit on it so this was an absolute dealbreaker for me its sad because i absolutely love everything else about the phone especially the design edit heres the vid
Android,not_removed,i feel like the idea wasis brilliant i was just unfortunate that the model i got had poor quality components i cant say for certain but i believe it was a oneoff bad model i mean plenty of other people have been happy with theirs the wifi speeds on my model were inadequate same wifi network same distance from the router my computer registered mbps my robin registered mbps
Android,not_removed,will the current warranty remain or change when razor takes over
Android,not_removed,telecasters for me love it
Android,not_removed,how can you say a phone that we have no concrete information about looks good
Android,not_removed,ah mine cost £ or around cad
Android,not_removed,isnt that rfitbit now
Android,not_removed,im sad for this
Android,not_removed,not just leds green leds
Android,not_removed,itd be called the robin
Android,not_removed,razer phoenix chroma
Android,not_removed,twice the price of its competitors dies in six months sucks while its alive the razer combo but at least it has flashing lights
Android,not_removed,and shit quality control out are defective
Android,not_removed,my moto z play is pretty damn awesome
Android,not_removed,the only i can get is in resident evil
Android,not_removed,appreciate it
Android,not_removed,same here the only thing that kept me from a robin was the battery is my new minimum nowadays
Android,not_removed,razer blade looks pretty good
Android,not_removed,i dont really know is how you can think their keyboards or mice are ugly their keyboards are black with the same layout as everything else the leds are incredibly configurable and they got a decent selection of their proprietary switches if youre a hardcore mechanical user i can understand complaining but the majority of users arent their mice are nice great ergonomics and fairly sturdy they do have a qc problem occasionally but with the exception of one mouse out of the ive bought they have lasted through years of use and again they offer them in enough configurations with wildly configurable led profiles go make it fit whatever you want
Android,not_removed,yeah their laptops are pretty nice other than the razer logo on the lid some of their mice look alright i have the epic naga chroma which is basically the only wireless mouse with the thumb pad i could find no one else seems to make one
Android,not_removed,the phone was made out of plastic and can easily break this is not a phone you would buy for durability
Android,not_removed,would buy does it even support crysis
Android,not_removed,id fucking kill for an rgb notification light
Android,not_removed,you joke but the logo being used as a notification light could work nicely
Android,not_removed,next brazzers
Android,not_removed,chroma android phone id dig that
Android,not_removed,so instead of one android rgb notification led the entire edge of the phone will be an rgb light strip the phone will pulsate blue all the way around when you get a facebook message yellow for snapchat
Android,not_removed,there should be a standard rgb notification led on the front and then an rgb light in the razer logo on the back i dont know if that would be difficult for them to do but it would look badass as fuck
Android,not_removed,this things going to just be a small metal business card black on one side screen no bezzles on the other oled display gsync nvidia tegra pa on board get them on it
Android,not_removed,better than the inevitable boot loop
Android,not_removed,so a triskele with snakes that isnt really tribal at all is edgy and tribal plus razer actually makes some decent stuff they certainly have quality control issues but they make solid products that usually last a decent amount of time guess well just have to disagree
Android,not_removed,the reason you dont see inbetween reviews are because people dont feel motivated enough to share their stories there is selection bias as work here
Android,not_removed,bros been using every iteration of the naga since the first one all of them started having button double clicking problems i personally however have only encountered problems with my lachesis and mamba is still going strong though
Android,not_removed,have had my copperhead for years now i clean it regularly and it still runs absolutely perfect
Android,not_removed,had great potential but the design team dropped the ball weirdly enough the nintendo switch joycon dock controller looks a lot like the ouya controller
Android,not_removed,i hope that big dream includes a bigger phone with the same design whatever you guys do please dont change the design of your product
Android,not_removed,i know i can be salty at both i was about to buy their phone but verizon sucks and they cancelled their phone
Android,not_removed,seems a little easier than getting a new phone hombre
Android,not_removed,yeah buying a new phone is way easier
Android,not_removed,rgb and led as design elements dependsif it kills your battery then im against it
Android,not_removed,sony liked it in the xperia u
Android,not_removed,or please connect to razer synapse to adjust volume
Android,not_removed,you would look like a man child with a razer phone
Android,not_removed,razers target audience for aesthetics is yr old boys
Android,not_removed,im not sure i would ever go back to a non backlit keyboard again however when your fucking mouse pad is glowing different colors and the rearedges of your monitor are putting out more light than the screen something is wrong
Android,not_removed,theyve never made a smartwatch they made a classy looking smartband though
Android,not_removed,they make a mouse called deathadder their product catalog reads like a metalocalypse setlist
Android,not_removed,also its pretty as fuck
Android,not_removed,any thoughts a few months in i kinda wanna get one still
Android,not_removed,our warranty for unlocked bootloader remains but it hardware warranty has been changed to last until july
Android,not_removed,i had a seafoam green tele that i miss dearly ive been looking for the exact one and have yet to find it it was bought years ago then sold years ago by a roommate who needed money while i was away for basic training one day ill find it
Android,not_removed,only if you float there on a river of tears
Android,not_removed,why not red leds everyone knows red leds are for performance
Android,not_removed,you do know what rgb means right
Android,not_removed,i thought it would be chromatic leds
Android,not_removed,rmedleds
Android,not_removed,green rgb leds confirmed
Android,not_removed,and if you want more colours you gotta pay extra
Android,not_removed,chroma leds
Android,not_removed,nah itll be called the new robin
Android,not_removed,not necessarily my first razer product was a deathadder mouse i bought in its more comfortable for me than any other mouse in its price range and has the same feature set as its peers it did stereotypically go wrong after months with a broken middleclick button of all things razers design language is horrible and their qc is hugely questionable but it doesnt mean their products are eternally horrid i spent two weeks hunting down anything that felt as good as the deathadder for a replacement i ended up buying the new deathadder elite
Android,not_removed,bought a razer copperhead anarchy red on woot for loved it used it for about years its what sold me on the razer naga epic for iforgotmylogininfotowootandtheystoppedputtingitintheemail six years later still going strong though i never use the wireless function
Android,not_removed,im typing this on my blackwidow they die every years or so but razer has always surprisingly allowed me to rma them for free
Android,not_removed,nah mate i had a razer diamond back that kept trucking for years before i finally replaced it with a deathadder chroma best mice ive ever used
Android,not_removed,never really understood this sentiment bought a razer naga that molten edition broke down after years and with broke down i mean that the right mouse button sometimes double clicks at will got a new one while i use the old one for traveling pretty solid imo
Android,not_removed,same here i much prefer lenovos stance on sd card slots anyway as much as i admired the first two moto xs under googles ownership i never could own one due to the lack of an sd card slot
Android,not_removed,my moto x is just about perfect if only theyd actually honor their claim of two years of updates
Android,not_removed,i just wish wed get nougat already
Android,not_removed,also i never owned one because i had never heard of you i now did and wouls buy right away it all looks perfect but im really not into the razer stuff can i read somewhere more about what this means to nextbit will your next phone be a gaming phone with sweet ass leds that breaks in months just personal experience with razer
Android,not_removed,stock android and rapid update i would be all over your devices
Android,not_removed,most phones have an rgb notification light
Android,not_removed,rip in peace galaxy nexus i loved that led
Android,not_removed,my mi max has an led that can do rgb is this not a standard feature on all android phones
Android,not_removed,cough cough
Android,not_removed,now with porn bloatware
Android,not_removed,i dont mean that its a bad thing ill be shopping for a razer blackwidow chroma keyboard in the near future but they are known for gratuitous led lighting which is a feature not a bug for you and me razertier led lighting for ringingvarious other functions and mkbhd approved dopeness would make for a cool gimmick that id strongly consider as far as the gskill bit look at their keyboards or more extravagantly designed lines of ripjaws memory heatsinks
Android,not_removed,probably something like that
Android,not_removed,some polycarbonate plastic like on samsungs covers and whatnot would be good this stuff he was able to bend with little force and even ripped through it
Android,not_removed,i hope that big dream includes a bigger smaller phone with the same design ftfy p
Android,not_removed,but its not nextbits fault verizon was the one that canceled it why are you salty towards nextbit
Android,not_removed,theres also the matter of me not wanting downtime while i fix the buggered sensors and baseband on this phone id rather upgrade then fix the to replace my dads aging moto g
Android,not_removed,correct answer
Android,not_removed,tronphone 😍😍😍
Android,not_removed,mechanical touch screen keyboard is the way to go i was sceptical but after buying the phone with butterfly© mechanical® floating switches im never going
Android,not_removed,and two fold out screens
Android,not_removed,razer synapse is unable to login at this moment try again later
Android,not_removed,yeah dude i cant possibly be using the tech i want to use if usabascotauce finds it manchildworthy
Android,not_removed,their laptops basically look like black macbooks putting aside the logo they seem quite tasteful
Android,not_removed,til i am a year old boy i have the blackwidow keyboard and the naga mouse
Android,not_removed,other than the bezels i think the razer blade is quite nice
Android,not_removed,and priced for adults with a mortgage 😂
Android,not_removed,i know wherevl all my keys are its not like im hunt and pecking if i had my way keys wouldnt even be labeled
Android,not_removed,yes razer is famous for their classy designs
Android,not_removed,also the mint colour really isnt for me and im happy with my own phone but for us eu folk pretty cheap as well
Android,not_removed,i honestly think its ugly as fuck
Android,not_removed,im definitely liking it and the nougat upgrade improved overall smoothness and battery life quite a bit that being said battery life does still leave a little to be desired and youll definitely want a case judging by jerryrigeverythings durability test
Android,not_removed,man that sucks i wish you the best of luck in finding it
Android,not_removed,of the owners who turned down almost a quarter billion from citizen watches
Android,not_removed,but green means go and red means stop
Android,not_removed,red leds for higher clock speed green for less power consumption blue for lower cooling temperatures thats science
Android,not_removed,red leds fast green leds power efficient blue leds coolquiet
Android,not_removed,not to mention it makes things httpswwwredditcomrthreetimesfaster
Android,not_removed,razer bought their assets only green leds allowed
Android,not_removed,obviously razer leds can only be green
Android,not_removed,im liking raven
Android,not_removed,robin u
Android,not_removed,broken middle click always happens on my deathadders
Android,not_removed,razer copperhead anarchy red who the fuck names these things
Android,not_removed,i just replaced my naga epic with the naga hex strictly because i decided i wanted to upgrade the original naga epic is easily one of the best products razer has made imo got it on sale for about instead of the whopping or so it was going for about years ago and it still works like new although the numbers on the side buttons have worn off since i used the hell out of it amazing mouse
Android,not_removed,pretty sure moto pure was made under google
Android,not_removed,in fairness the moto x play had an sd slot
Android,not_removed,very few have a true rgb light most of them are simply solid colors
Android,not_removed,not really no
Android,not_removed,some devices ditched them which i dont agree with the notification led is a brilliant thing no one noticed over the years though because samsung still has the led
Android,not_removed,rgb back 🍆💦💦
Android,not_removed,gotta be stattrak
Android,not_removed,gold plated usb cable for faster charging speeds
Android,not_removed,like phones dont already get stolen enough
Android,not_removed,thats just like my opinion man
Android,not_removed,i moved from a macbook pro to a razer stealth other than the logo whose led can be turned off its a very well designed understated laptop very happy with it so far
Android,not_removed,agreed the rbs is probably the sexiest thing ive ever owned if i could get it in black id easily recommend it over a samegen xps
Android,not_removed,you just have the taste and class of one
Android,not_removed,i know wherevl all my keys are k
Android,not_removed,just because their logo isnt an apple doesnt make their design any less classier i routinely take my razer blade laptop with me on business trips and meetings
Android,not_removed,wow at that price if it shipped to canada id definitely get one
Android,not_removed,i wish i could buy it but no different then my nexus what a shame loved the different look they were going for
Android,not_removed,i really appreciate the looks its finally something different in the wade of all black squares with goldmetal or silvermetal backs
Android,not_removed,its almost like taste is subjective
Android,not_removed,its a really sharp distinctive device in person the pictures dont do it justice people notice it because it doesnt blend in like most other roundy rectangles ive had a surprising amount of people ask me about a cheap phone i picked up for a year waiting for the next pixel or or something higher end
Android,not_removed,they didnt turn it down citizen never officially offered it called off the whole thing during due diligence if i recall
Android,not_removed,nah red wunz go fastah
Android,not_removed,nah green is efficient red is fast blue is cool
Android,not_removed,httpiimgurcomuhvckjpg
Android,not_removed,just like with hdds
Android,not_removed,have you tried literally punching the button i got about two months extra out of it by doing that also fixed an unresponsive button on a mechanical razer keyboard by hammering it really hard repeatedly
Android,not_removed,my question would be do they fire him as soon as he turns or do they wait a bit
Android,not_removed,doesnt matter year olds buy them and spam the internet that theyre the best
Android,not_removed,yeah it may have been i kind of stopped keeping up with moto news shortly after i switched over to sony during the year of the original moto x
Android,not_removed,rgb slide out keyboard
Android,not_removed,just put a screen on both sides
Android,not_removed,httpwwwpenzatraderuphonevertuvertusignaturegoldjpg
Android,not_removed,i get that but it just sounds silly to me that some would put some dude on the bus might think im childish over better functionality although im sure lots of people do
Android,not_removed,if i could get it in black isnt it only available in black
Android,not_removed,i love their mice i probably should try a different brand but ive had such good luck with them
Android,not_removed,ironically was typing that on my phone that is where i have no fucking clue where my keys are because i type by muscle memory and its also a lot harder to feel when youve made a typo pretty funny though
Android,not_removed,thats like the one restrained thing they make though and even then the font on the keyboard is horrific
Android,not_removed,nobodys assuming the prevalence of an apple denotes good design but razers general visual aesthetic is not what id call classy i dont think anyone can deny that the apple watch just as an example looks heaps better than the razer nabu watch
Android,not_removed,indeed i feel crazy when everyone loves the galaxy series and i think theyre pretty bad big rounded corners and all that ugh
Android,not_removed,i got one for my dad and i as much as i liked it in pictures i love it in person it feels so much better than my nexus it has some quirks that im not too keen on lack of usb otg was a big one though maybe that has been resolved by now but overall its a really fantastic phone
Android,not_removed,the dark version is fine i liked that i just didnt like the other ones specially the whitegreen it just look so cheap and fragile
Android,not_removed,thats why i said i honestly think its just my opinion
Android,not_removed,we waaaaaaagh now
Android,not_removed,youre thinking of yellow
Android,not_removed,huh that does kinds seem to help thanks
Android,not_removed,rgb slide out mechanical keyboard
Android,not_removed,a real yes please
Android,not_removed,why does that company still exist
Android,not_removed,fashion over function tis life
Android,not_removed,no shame man the deathadder is one of my favorite mice ever
Android,not_removed,yeah i dont ever look at my keyboard to type either but its nice to have some light to get your hands if the room is dark maybe not so necessary on a big chunky mechanical board where the keys stick out inches but on a laptop with chicklets its pretty handy
Android,not_removed,they actually changed the font about a year ago unless youre talking about their updated font but it seems inoffensive to me
Android,not_removed,even though i think youre being sarcastic i do cover the logo with a matte black skin from dbrand not because im ashamed of opening it up in front of other colleagues but because the backlight can get distracting when the lights are down during meetings
Android,not_removed,well thats because it is was it always was a budget phone on amazon rn trying to get a following for its cloud stuff and different looks
Android,not_removed,im da biggest im da boss
Android,not_removed,da httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainredonesgofaster and me waaaaagh disagree hyoomie
Android,not_removed,yellow would be a galaxy note
Android,not_removed,lol lgsending out review units months later
Android,not_removed,how did you contact them
Android,not_removed,nope htc u ultra is
Android,not_removed,so does this mean an international version of exynos could be used in usa thats pretty hype
Android,not_removed,how come they cant just give the people that chooseforced to be on verizon the snapdragon phone and let the rest of us that arent stuck with cdma get the exynos phone
Android,not_removed,so they have it but its still not good enough for their flagship devices so they buy chips from someone else why bother developing this then or at least why bother announcing it hey everybody we made a new chip thats less useful than the chip we already have yay i guess
Android,not_removed,it already can be on every non cdma carrier
Android,not_removed,they have issues with lte licensing in the us its much easier and cheaper to launch snapdragon devices because of this
Android,not_removed,it will be it takes time to develop these things into flagshipquality components
Android,not_removed,their mobile division is not the same as their processor division they sell exynos chips to other oems and make a lot of money doing it just like with their displays also i dont see how the chip is less useful just because its not as powerful as their more expensive top of the line soc
Android,not_removed,afaik exynos version does not support usa lte bands are you saying it already does
Android,not_removed,i kind of wish we could move past lte anyway it just irks me to hear it advertised as when it isnt
Android,not_removed,who besides meizu buys exynos chips
Android,not_removed,i used a exynos on att and had lte check httpwwwwillmyphoneworknet for instance the is the intl and it works on gsm lte networks or at least some of the bands
Android,not_removed,wait what is a marketing term lte is a technology lte almost always qualifies as but doesnt mean its using lte technology i think youre confusing it with hspa
Android,not_removed,i can get mbps down on lte as opposed to on hspa if lte isnt then what is
Android,not_removed,i hope more and more companies will because of qualcomms terrible efficiency and performance lately
Android,not_removed,lte isnt only lte advanced is
Android,not_removed,until you i had never heard the term hspa so no your assumption is incorrect is a link to a pdf document published by the international telecommunications union itu while it does state that the term is not defined it also expressly states that lte winmax and hspa are all evolved technologies it also states that the target for the next generation is megabit while mobile and gigabit while stationary thats about times fast as the speeds quoted earlier in the thread
Android,not_removed,because true is supposed to be able to maintain those kinds of speeds while still being able to change cells lte cant do that it cant maintain that data rate while moving there are other conditions such as being fully ip based instead of circuit switched data network vs phone network etc
Android,not_removed,there is a second protocol that meets the standard but the name is escaping me at the moment being awake for hours now is gumming up the works
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,last i checked megabit is less than the megabit specified in the document i linked
Android,not_removed,this was years ago and mbps still isnt bad
Android,not_removed,it was also probably under optimal conditions not across a busy network
Android,not_removed,and here i am on wind in toronto lucky to get half a megabit during peak hours runs on aws bands and
Android,not_removed,so wind is broken
Android,not_removed,its a massive scam thats all there is to it if its not vaporware its an attempt to scam the indian government out of money probably just vaporware though
Android,not_removed,theres a shitload of threads and articles about it did you bother doing any research at all
Android,not_removed,scam probably multiple scams at once
Android,not_removed,it is an identity theft scam
Android,not_removed,i read that as vaporwave and thought holy shit there is an android smartphone with a vaporwave aesthetic i gotta check this out
Android,not_removed,whats vaporware
Android,not_removed,yeah agree with you there its not vaporware just a heavily subsidised device by the government at least that is what it is supposed to be but there is kickback iirc there is a subsidy per device or something and the company wants enough money to subsidize phone per human on earth or something so it could be much more expensive before the subsidy than
Android,not_removed,s m a r t p h o n e
Android,not_removed,a big ol vaporwave
Android,not_removed,a n d r o i d
Android,not_removed,for comparison should do in half an hour i think
Android,not_removed,is it symbolic that the motorola logo gets punched out and replaced by a lenovo one
Android,not_removed,the lenovo at the end its the end of an era for sure
Android,not_removed,the sound doesnt happen on an actual boot right
Android,not_removed,damn thats a really cool boot animation i want it
Android,not_removed,considering lenovo just laid off like out of of motos remaining workforce goodbye moto seems more appropriate
Android,not_removed,more like goodbye moto
Android,not_removed,so lenovo is giving moto an uppercut
Android,not_removed,thanks lenovo for completely destroying what was left of motorola im in the market for a new pc laptop to replace the mac i dont like anymore and lenovo will not be an option ill be considering
Android,not_removed,wth did i just watched in all seriousness though remove lenovo branding at the end cause now theres two different brands on one phone
Android,not_removed,fuck lenovo
Android,not_removed,reminiscent of the x
Android,not_removed,ayyyyyy lmao
Android,not_removed,the fuck
Android,not_removed,
Android,not_removed,yep its almost definitely an injoke like the zombie grunting disgustedly at the lenovo logo on the moto z commercial oh i get it moto zombie commercial
Android,not_removed,hi folks we took an already shit warranty department trashed it further and laid off plenty of people in chicago only leaving a guy to turn on and off the lights in the office thanks google
Android,not_removed,and the subtle chinese accent on the hello moto this shit actually gave me goosebumps
Android,not_removed,please nothing compared to the holiday boot animation released on the original moto g
Android,not_removed,moto is still so far ahead of the pack on ux they do very few things but they get them all right down to small details like this
Android,not_removed,better than the moto x pure animation
Android,not_removed,ayyyyyy lmao lmoto
Android,not_removed,howd you get
Android,not_removed,it does not sound like a chinese accent more like a french one
Android,not_removed,omg that was from the googlerolas animation team they were lead by former pixar animators their spotlight stories were beautiful hope we see them again for daydream
Android,not_removed,a google company feelsbadman
Android,not_removed,damn that looks slick ive never even owned a motorola device moto x style was so close but even this makes me sad that google sold them off
Android,not_removed,was in gen moto x too
Android,not_removed,first gen motogoogle products were the best after than the wheels started to fall off although i did like the size of the gen moto x
Android,not_removed,bought this phone for cyber monday and the holiday animation was such a treat it wasnt perfect but it felt very innovative and was the perfect form factor
Android,not_removed,the youtube progress spinner us exactly the same size of that center part on my phone thought it was part of the animation
Android,not_removed,except motorola is basically gone all the developers that worked on the motorola ux we love so much were fired in lenovos first round of layoffs and now everythings just getting copied with nothing really new to continue on motorolas great innovation without getting too obtuse if motorola was still under google wed probably be seeing even more impressive lightweight improvements to aosp that we dont get anywhere else for example moto display is amazing and nobody does it better what else doesnt exist yet that might have been
Android,not_removed,thats something that i miss from the og moto x we got the fun little ar spotlight stories and the various seasonal boot animations
Android,not_removed,i agree only thing i dont like in this one is that it says lenovo
Android,not_removed,hey i still like the x pure stitch animation i think its pretty nice
Android,not_removed,ayyyyyy lmao lmoto lnovo
Android,not_removed,your imōto is a shit
Android,not_removed,i probably have to change that sorry i was on but now im on but alpha cheers
Android,not_removed,nah frenchies would say ello moto because the h is slient in french
Android,not_removed,what exactly has lenovo done wrong with moto what the hell have they copied from other oems the z line is excellent and its a natural evolution of motorolas project ara every single moto feature has been left untouched or improved moto phones are still the best version of aosp there is i mean its sad people were laid off but lenovo hasnt done anything wrong youre just blaming them for your unsustained idea that for some reason google ownership not intervention just ownership would have been better
Android,not_removed,yep those came from an animation group lead by former bigtime pixar animators under motorola atap they gave an amazing authentic feel to motorola while it lasted theyre under google now
Android,not_removed,can i get a link to i might root edit
Android,not_removed,this is refreshing you remind me of myself in my vehement defense oh motorola even under lenovo ownership but i see the old vestiges of moto fading away under lenovo they havent screwed with the moto design yet and im happy about that i hope it continues but the firing of the developers leads me to believe that theyre removing those that would actually speak out and try to disrupt any major changes that lenovo no doubt would love to do my biggest complaint with lenovos ownership so far isnt software its hardware theyve dismantled something moto got right just even perfected before sale the simplicity and smart segmentation of the market while making broad compatibility paramount heres how lenovo fucked up the last round of googleled moto phones three moto x style play force focusing on performance battery life or durability respectively one moto g one moto e the first lineup of lenovoled phones three droid z locked to verizon and a timed exclusive why the fuck would you kill hype for the broader market three moto z unlocked but gsm only and more expensive already overpriced compared to last year screwing over nonverizon customers while reducing compatibility and choice if you have sprint or usc you could have a moto x but not a moto z three moto g why a and plus and the play is just the by a different name one moto e upcoming unannounced moto m heres what i would do if i were lenovo one droid z force lock it to verizon go ahead and make it a timed exclusive if you really need to to rub verizons dick hard enough to satisfy contracts two moto z style and play unlocked for all carriers priced affordably like the moto x and upsell the hell out of the mods one moto g the plus one moto e can the moto m it has no segment and cannibalizes the e there i made lenovos supply chain way simpler made everyone that wanted a true sequel to the x happy still maintained the successful g and e lines and still rubbed verizons dick why did they have to literally add distinct models overprice the flagship and alienate current customers to what end they need to attract more people and gimping what was already offered is a shit start to that i wouldve bought a moto z play but not at that price and without total carrier portability stop giving verizon such ludicrous advantages price fairly bring back broad compatibility and take my money otherwise watch your revenues shrink and blame the market for being imbeciles instead of your own strategy that has already failed the vibe family
Android,not_removed,isnt moto maker basically dead on the firstgen lenovorola phones
Android,not_removed,be careful is a alpha all works perfectly but we dont have a camera working yet its the unique problem here
Android,not_removed,isnt going to come out soon also

Android,not_removed,im really looking forward to hearing more about the soc im guessing the first iteration isnt going to be a rival to the sd chips but hopefully they will make a competitive product and sold in the us
Android,not_removed,at the price theyre gonna be selling the mi at this aint bad at all the cpu is inline with the snapdragon and helio but the gpu trounces both
Android,not_removed,any competition to qualcomm in mobile is welcome any competition to intel in pcs is welcome
Android,not_removed,great to see another player in the mobile cpu market yet revealing benchmarks without without showing the power consumption is useless there are many chips already which are faster than an sd im looking forward to benchmarks plus the which uses the new chip is announced for about euro whereas the redmi note with a sd costs about euro
Android,not_removed,wonder where they got the baseband which from the slide looks to be integrated
Android,not_removed,could be big in a few years huawei has their own soc xiaomi has their soc this could push qc to finally be competitive i think google will come out with a soc eventually
Android,not_removed,can anyone tell me what does this mean for the future of community developed firmware for xiaomi devices
Android,not_removed,with this ends the support for future community developmets rip
Android,not_removed,great to see this xiaomi is the best bang for buck
Android,not_removed,its insane to see some company doing rd and making processor inhouse with low margins in profit now i am actually thinking one point of companies like apple and samsung overcharging for their product getting stricked out
Android,not_removed,it is said that mi only available for china mobile network
Android,not_removed,yet another irrelevant soc from a developers standpoint ohh well
Android,not_removed,so it uses pinecone processor
Android,not_removed,surge is a pretty nice name ngl
Android,not_removed,your turn google
Android,not_removed,but why they basically just killed off rom development for this phone
Android,not_removed,seems like the price sensitive times of introducing new smartphones to the masses are over even china is sick of qualcomms crap now and wats better stuff
Android,not_removed,they should fire the namer asap
Android,not_removed,let us see what xiaomi has got for the competition hope it would be as good as qualcomm performance wise
Android,not_removed,cmon nvidia
Android,not_removed,i wonder if its a real inhouse chip or a rebrand of a mediatek the problem with all these nonqualcomm chips is their modems are not highend
Android,not_removed,first gen is china mobile only no wcdma either
Android,not_removed,more like a
Android,not_removed,sounds like a great value chip how many shader cores is it are there any benchmarks yet edit found some benchmarks note its likely the mi are nonfinal firmware gfxbench car chase manhattan manhattan manhattan trex mi fps fps fps fps fps z play fps fps fps fps fps
Android,not_removed,is the mediateks version of the ive been looking at phones with their processors and trying to figure out if the phones with a were overpriced
Android,not_removed,intel tried getting into mobile market but failed they are still trying one last time though qualcomm is slowly entering into pc market they just announced collaboration with windows and all native apps will now work with arm based processors first market will be tabletsurface book like devices which will migrate to notebookpc market later also in last intels investors call they mentioned that intel will focus more on data center applications only since they see decline in pc market so its a good chance for qualcomm to enter that market amd is really trying hard to enter pc market ryzen showing some potential but with less than market share its really difficult for them to win intel is crushing them amd might also have some mobile platform by timeframe but i dont know how seriously market will take them
Android,not_removed,i think the will have better build quality though and that is more expensive than difference of price in chips
Android,not_removed,that will be the biggest concern big reason why mtk chipsets get worse battery life is their modems are garbage compared to qualcomm
Android,not_removed,yup theyve been working on it so hopefully pixel else pixel should have something inhouse
Android,not_removed,it means its over for any phone based on these chips they already do a shitty job of gpl compliance with qualcomm helping them by themselves theyll just violate the gpl left right and center theres a good chance that they wont use these chips for international sales though selling a product directly into western markets that violates the gpl is just asking for a lawsuit
Android,not_removed,i love the xiaomi phones ive owned and run miui but i agree they release source for their sd chips but change fingerprint sensors and other hardware and never release source for it
Android,not_removed,they may have this as their cheap option and sell sd versions of their phones as the more expensive higher end option
Android,not_removed,we dont know this yet
Android,not_removed,if only they release sources like they have to so that developers can build roms
Android,not_removed,also makes you question what htc did with the ridiculous margins on the desire series and the which sold very well besides their money
Android,not_removed,they dont really overcharge anything imo it was noted before that samsungs processor division still has to go through a bidding process to get their processors in their own phones the had the exynos processor because the qualcomm one at the time was so bad they couldnt justify to use it even in their cdma models so it wasnt really a cost thing before also samsung and apple have a level of refinement that demand the higher price both of their flagship phones have killer design with thin bodies and excellent colors materials and finish i really dont think there are a lot of companies that use series aluminum in their phones they both have excellent hardware and especially in the camera department they have excellent software to match its amazing how much phone you get for now but the extra that the likes of samsung and apple charge goes towards going above and beyond in hardware
Android,not_removed,volume makes up for margins
Android,not_removed,youre totally correct its really why when people say this oem overcharges its a clear sign they dont get how business works they charge that much so they can do rd secure huge volumes of components etc
Android,not_removed,do xioami phones in china release with qualcomm chips
Android,not_removed,i like the name if the high end is like or smth just easier to indentify whats high specs and low specs because normal people dont know anything about cpus
Android,not_removed,as opposed to american intelligence agencies
Android,not_removed,kinda true because is based on so more powerefficient while this xiaomis chip is based on same as but performancewise it might be more like a than multicore benchmark scores are more than not sure about singlecore scores edit singlecore score is less in xiaomis chip compared to a
Android,not_removed,i meant purely performance wise
Android,not_removed,quad
Android,not_removed,im a bit surprised that they went with the this really seems like what the was designed for maybe it was just too short a notice for xiaomi to incorporate it into their chip although the is already in active use elsewhere
Android,not_removed,intel is crushing them just wait until march the eternal btfo of intel is about to commence
Android,not_removed,yup theyve been working on it so hopefully pixel else pixel should have something inhouse while google might make a soc one day there have been no public indications of them working on an arm mips or soc for phones yet the three architectures that android currently supports there are substantial portions of phone chips namely the cellular radios that they do not yet have the required ip or design teams for all their recent semiconductor announcements and purchases have been related to their server team for openpower and riscv and have been primarily about pushing advancements upstream rather than actually developing chips inhouse
Android,not_removed,we really dont know that i would be extremely surprised if the pixel had a google soc
Android,not_removed,thank youi dont know about where you live but in indiaespecially in ncrpeople prefer xiaomis devices due to the fact that the modding community is huge for their best selling devices if they launch based device a lot of people are gonna drift away from their devices
Android,not_removed,we dont know this yet they to httpswwwxdadeveloperscomxiaomifinallyreleaseskernelsources their to release the source code for phones with qualcomm snapdragon chips which qualcomm makes incredibly easy for their mediatek phones the source code is almost nonexistent their refusal to comply with the license that they agreed to and have to agree to in order to distribute android is not a technical issue its a corporate culture issue
Android,not_removed,this is randroid were on get used to premature overreaction
Android,not_removed,redmi note has many custom roms recently they have released source code for all their devices a bit late release but they have released the sources
Android,not_removed,so roughly the same performance as a but less efficient its a good step but it shows that manufacturing an inhouse processor isnt easy heres hoping surge or or whatever its called the one with the cores and process comes out soon thats the one to really look out for edit heres the rumor the second chipset is the pinecone which seems to be a high end processor that would probably take on competitors this chipset also includes cores cores clocked at and cores clocked at the gpu on this chipset is the mali which is clocked at however this processor would not be out till the fourth quarter of this year
Android,not_removed,is built on lp with high leakage while this one is built on a way newer process hpc the power consumtion of the cpu part will probably be similar to mtk helio cores ie way less than cores
Android,not_removed,i couldnt find an official source to comfirm but benchmarks do look like a
Android,not_removed,agreed although the was announced a bit later than the edit was announced late may was announced late october
Android,not_removed,seems like was in design from a long time that might also explain
Android,not_removed,btfo in the consumer pc market or datacenter
Android,not_removed,people in india buy it for the stellar pricing modding will not be more than of over all buyers
Android,not_removed,and in the case of the mipad years granted it was tegrapowered but other tablets with the chips were not stuck with without sources
Android,not_removed,its prematurely based on xiaomis behaviour during the entire companys existence this time will be different get out of here
Android,not_removed,except when they fucking switched the fingerprints sensor halfway through production and never released sources for the newer goodix variants newer cyanogenmodlineageos based roms dont have working fingerprint sensors theres a patch somewhere for this if you dig through pages of an xda thread and i believe you also need to flash a custom kernel
Android,not_removed,a bit late months is not a bit late its very very late
Android,not_removed,except that they releases are shit for example for the mi pad they released completely broken sources after a year now they refuse to do a correct release stating that they code works it does not same shit with other devices too
Android,not_removed,and yet the firmware for your baseband processor is closed source and must be approved by the fcc what makes you think there arent back doors in there
Android,not_removed,xiaomi has nothing to do with the chinese government either
Android,not_removed,yeah in house chips are difficult to do well ive recently been very surprised by the standard that huawei is getting from their kirin chips the is a beast
Android,not_removed,what are the odds the pinecone is an intel nm and not samsung
Android,not_removed,here you go mentioned in slide image
Android,not_removed,from planning to production in months according to the tweet
Android,not_removed,both hopefully naples will bring a lot to server chips and data centers
Android,not_removed,well i was just telling you what i have observed the situation may be way different
Android,not_removed,says the sony owner
Android,not_removed,the exynos socs too although samsung has been practicing with midend chips for years prior to the
Android,not_removed,pretty much intel nm is expensive to contract out samsungglofo nm and tsmc nm are substantially cheaper
Android,not_removed,that third party was rumored to be lg instead of xiaomi which really makes more sense im sure lg has the resources for it and after getting screwed out of the this year im sure they wont want the same shit to happen again
Android,not_removed,expensive intel modems i dont think so only intel ip and whatever arm bothered to port over to the intel process is allowed here after acquiring infineon intel seems to have stepped up their baseband game they have managed to design the modem dsp themselves instead of relying on mediocre ceva ip like the others do
Android,not_removed,thanks for that all the links i saw earlier didnt have the full set of slides
Android,not_removed,whats on march
Android,not_removed,says the sony owner sony releases their kernel sources as they are legally required to builds public aosp code bases for their phones and even contributes upstream yeah theyre having trouble with figuring out how to attract purchases despite some fantastic improvements to their line as of late but in terms of calling companies out for failing to comply with the they have more standing than almost anyone
Android,not_removed,says the sony owner
Android,not_removed,plus with the kind of value for money that xiaomi offers they want the stuff done for the lowest rates
Android,not_removed,as someone who knows next to nothing about this shit this comment thread is fascinating now i want to know more about processors and their manufacturer in methods although i should probably start with how they work seeing as i want to get into computer science
Android,not_removed,the release of ryzen
Android,not_removed,their problem to me is like htcs problem they just dont stand out samsung has the benefit of usually having the best in class specs betting their screen and exynos will be the best again this year while lg usually isnt afraid to push boundaries sony designs are the same year after year which would not be a bad thing if the design is good imho its not
Android,not_removed,is their aosp for their phones still terribly broken however i remember at one point it didnt include camera support at all and ril was broken for some device however that was pretty quickly fixed
Android,not_removed,i own a sony i was somehow brought into multiple private developer chats including jerpelea himself trust me when i say that the majority of your first paragraph is moot its pr so that people who dont own a sony andor dont know much about the project can praise the company
Android,not_removed,i embrace the shittyness of the company if i get a chance to badmouth it you better believe shade will be thrown
Android,not_removed,this might be a good start on the fab side
Android,not_removed,even though ryzen performance and price is good its hard for them to get market share unfortunately just having a better product doesnt mean you will win execution matters more these days which intel is winning
Android,not_removed,why again this year for display there is no doubt about it but the was definitely better than the exynos
Android,not_removed,its pretty much the case now lots of stuff is broken on aosp also drm keys are bitch if you want to unlock bootloader
Android,not_removed,thanks a lot
Android,not_removed,apples to oranges i agree that the will likely be better but we are in randroid and theres no way we will get to use the
Android,not_removed,i imagine the xperia xz performance will have the best phone screen this year
Android,not_removed,no not apples to oranges the previous comment said class leading soc the class in this case is smartphone and not android smartphone
Android,not_removed,we will see i would bet on the iphone when its released since apple had that crown for the last years
Android,not_removed,i strongly disagree if we are talking about class then we should be talking about only the socs that go into android phones since the will never be used in an android device its irrelevant
Android,not_removed,no android smartphones is not what classleading means if he meant that he should have said best soc in any android phone if you restrict classleading to certain brands then it could also mean best soc in the class galaxy devices

Android,not_removed,disappointing that it behaves almost identically to marshmallow was to be expected with miui though hopefully by the time the update is released to everyone theyll implement more of nougats features on the other hand this is pretty quick for such a cheap phone and with such a deeply customized skin and it seems to be running very nicely even in alpha also has qualcomm mpdecision whatever that is
Android,not_removed,as long as bgcngm gets the blobs and things he needs im happy is already my daily driver on my mi and its amazing
Android,not_removed,glad to see this coming my main complaint with miui is the notification shade its awfully implemented with two fingers required to expand notifications and it also uses the app icon for things like facebook messenger and twitter rather than the users profile picture if they can fix that up theyll be on a winner
Android,not_removed,did you say global was there global before
Android,not_removed,so like that time they updated miui to marshmallow but userfacing features like now on tap came later
Android,not_removed,at least you can flash
Android,not_removed,i cant get myself to use miui until notification behavior is like stock two fingers to swipe down makes no sense at all
Android,not_removed,hows the camera and how does it compare to on miui
Android,not_removed,im on and its fantastic i havent moved over to yet because i dont see the point when its still using the marshmallow kernel
Android,not_removed,i just ordered my cant wait to install cm im so excited for this phone to replace my iphone
Android,not_removed,the semiofficial version in xda
Android,not_removed,i cant wait for video recording to be fixed i use it quite often is fantastic though so no complaints oh yeah and whatsapp notifications are still screwy with nougat on every phone so i guess i have to wait for whatsapp to fix that from their end
Android,not_removed,there are other small issues that xiaomi somehow refuses to correct i cant print a file from my phone neither can i use the lastpass keyboard to enter password on the browser these unnecessary edits can really be frustrating at times and why should one keep vertical moving windows like thy have i can barely see two applications at a time even apple has ensures one can see a lot more apps at the same time on the screen for multi tasking windows
Android,not_removed,there has been a global rom for the for a long time if thats what youre talking about
Android,not_removed,most likely yeah some marshmallow features were never implemented though such as the permissions manager they still use the miui one that came out a few years back
Android,not_removed,with crappy camera and potentially no android pay with other hiccups to be expected would be nice if xiaomi put a little attention to the market outside china
Android,not_removed,camera is worse than on miui but good enough for me everything else is amazing and much better than miui
Android,not_removed,what makes you choose instead of
Android,not_removed,id recommend getting until becomes a bit more stable e also cameranextmod is the best nonmiui camera in my experience
Android,not_removed,its unofficial now
Android,not_removed,just use another camera and video recording works what about whatsapp we use it a lot at work and i havent noticed any problems
Android,not_removed,swiping away notifications from the lockscreen only works with the default lockscreen though it doesnt work on any other themes ive never cared much about the need for a two finger swipe to expand notifications though it doesnt bother me in the slightest
Android,not_removed,wat no print on mm im sure most wont care but once you try it can never go back
Android,not_removed,wow i have been using miui eu roms is there any difference
Android,not_removed,using miui based on marshmallow it seems to use the marshmallow permission manager instead of the old miui one you can say doze was not implemented either but miui has had that kind of optimization for years and it works better imo
Android,not_removed,nah they use both the permission managers stock one is present in marshmallow
Android,not_removed,alright thanks my should be arriving soon and camera quality is the one thing making me unsure about using cm any chance you could share a couple of sample shots
Android,not_removed,everything else in my experience with cm or any nonstock rom really the audio quality is total garbage compared to miui
Android,not_removed,custom rom nicer design ois cheaper basically identical specs i like the more than the and ill probably replace it in a year or so so id rather save the cost of the and just get a
Android,not_removed,not him but i choose over because no gorilla glass not so good looking design and i can get the pro version for the same price of gb version also it already has official
Android,not_removed,okay thank you i will do that
Android,not_removed,yeah flashed it anyway seems stable enough hopefully not long it will be official
Android,not_removed,with multiple incoming messages you only get to see the latest one per chat in notifications checked in the rom and a friends pixel apparently its a problem with whatsapp not being fully compatible with new apis or something
Android,not_removed,i feel like almost all themes are garbage anyway even if they look nice its fucked somewhere like some odd lockscreen animations or something i feel like themes were working much better in the much earlier versions of miui
Android,not_removed,im not sure check out rxiaomi and the wiki
Android,not_removed,doze was definitely there because its required to be i seem to be wrong about the permission manager though
Android,not_removed,apply for the unlock permission beforehand if you want to flash custom roms
Android,not_removed,i havent experienced any problems with audio video recording doesnt work with stock camera yet but everything else is working very good
Android,not_removed,yeah thinking of cm and camera too but no gorilla glass maybe i just snag pro thanks
Android,not_removed,oh okey yeah i noticed that didnt remember that it used to be different
Android,not_removed,i do pretty much agree with you but thats why i use the customize theme function so i can pick the parts of various themes that work best currently im using the android n theme with the default lockscreen no miui icons because im using nova launcher
Android,not_removed,i didnt have problems either but headphone sound quality was total shit compared to miui even after using various sound mods thats the biggest reason why i went back to miui which has the best sound quality compared to any rom ive ever tried
Android,not_removed,yeah seems like some newer xiaomi phones are not coming with gorilla glass where it should have dont forget to apply for unlock permission early
Android,not_removed,i use bluetooth only no difference there at least
Android,not_removed,could you elaborate on this at all or is it really that simple like what was worse exactly because im getting a redmi note soon and am curious
Android,not_removed,basically everything youll be using a different device so im not sure how your experience will be but less bass lower volume much less clarity etc with that being said miui is only better after you turn on the sound enhancer features
Android,not_removed,alright then ill see how i go thanks
Android,not_removed,i didnt notice those differences on the note when i used it he might have way better headphones than i do though
Android,not_removed,see this is the type of stuff that could open vr outside of its current niche imagine something like partnerings with nat geo or planet earth iii in a few years thatd be mind blowing
Android,not_removed,somehow i thought they meant geocities and ask jeeves when they said ancient sites
Android,not_removed,breathtakingly realistic if our expectations for computer generated graphics were based in the early
Android,not_removed,ive done one of these vr archeology experiments irl seonjeongneung in seoul and they are completely fantastic and i had the bizarre experience of finding vr better than reality in vr when you looked at things the english language audio guide would tell you what it was there were people conducting a ceremony with a voiceover telling you what things were downside was that it was ugly as hell but overruled by the fact that you could fly in reality the trees were pretty it was hot as hell i had to walk uphill there were no signs or labels explaining anything i couldnt fly into the sky to get a better view ive done the vr videogames and been megaunimpressed but archaeological sites make so much sense for vr i hope someone does an underwater shipwreck one
Android,not_removed,how is it worth
Android,not_removed,fuck i just bought planet earth in better return it and wait for the vr edition
Android,not_removed,haha im glad im not the only one
Android,not_removed,time to do some altavista searches
Android,not_removed,holy shit me too i was actually kind of disappointed when they meant buildings hows it going fellow nerds
Android,not_removed,this was my first thought as well
Android,not_removed,excite
Android,not_removed,going onsite spending there a month taking pictures of the environment but not the object and the coming back and buying some basic model of whatever is not there anymore
Android,not_removed,well its aud not usd so its more like usd i believe
Android,not_removed,i miss allthewebcom their searches actually gave me relevent results too bad yahoo bought them out
Android,not_removed,im only somewhat ashamed to admit that i used to use altavista video searches for porn when i was a teenager of years of course
Android,not_removed,or digg up hotbot or excite or lykos
Android,not_removed,is the country india
Android,not_removed,bare in mind that the graphics look like they were rendered on my pentium
Android,not_removed,me cries for his dollar
Android,not_removed,i remember learning about html frames and going crazy by having a search box that searched on all those websites and displayed the results in separate frames
Android,not_removed,i used to use hotbot all the time because it made me feel like a rebel against google i also used to use excites free dialup internet but id directconnect so i didnt have the stupid ads slowing me down heh
