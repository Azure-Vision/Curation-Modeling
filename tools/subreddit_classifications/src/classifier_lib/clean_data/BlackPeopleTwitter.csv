BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hello fellow whitey lets take over this thread just like we took over the land of our loser opponents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats some rredpill negging shit not saying ive never done it in some capacity i dont do it if my girl is happy i only humble stuck up women who need a reality check
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this supposed to be funny what is this subreddit just a circlejerk of fucking idiots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course its a fat white chick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so im going to guess youre white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,typical beta i would beat her

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my parents live in a real nice area i was visiting them last week and a redneck drove by flicking me off for no reason sometimes white people will drive by giving angry looks i get the same result from rednecks driving my car its just a middle class infiniti are these white people racistwho knows they could be having a bad day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair they were probably being obnoxiously loud
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most white people are racist deep down so dont feel too bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but black people cant swim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its funny because theyre still less likely to get shot by the weird white kid than each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you also tired of having no father
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this entire sub is a bunch of white guys who caption photos with their idea of how black people talk im not big on getting offended by things i see on the internet but it really has become one of the most thoughtless subs around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how to spot a white guy on rblackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this post alone shows me that a majority of rblackpeopletwitter are actually white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly you just confused me even more
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he relate to something so relatable so hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,single moms treating their sons like shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you customize your appearance based on what you want to view yourself as single bitter white women want to be a sassy bitch who is worldly and jaded in an intellectual and endearing way and for some reason this haircut called a bob is the haircut adopted by the whole group of catty retards probably because it is easy to maintain and is expected to be dyed which easily covers the greys they earned by suffocating on dick in a cracker barrel bathroom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more white person gets shot by a cop no one cares black kid pulls gun on black cop gets shot by black cop and blacks burn down their own neighborhood and attack whites for being white milwaukee you people in this sub are so racist against white people it is just funny how hypocritical you all are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the reason this happens is because white people dont act like their whole race is under attack whenever something happens to a white person whilr blacks burn down neighborhoods because a black kid pulls a gun on a black cop and gets shot for it and blame white people for it maybe if blacks didnt act like they all were under attack then maybe they would be treated as individuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does a brotha not named bill clinton have to do to get some pssy in this house

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you fucking kidding me she has a dress up to her neck and youre still sexualizing her tf the first thing i thought when i saw this was wow what a strong woman to have been working in a typically male career at that time my first feeling was admiration yet you manage to discredit her and basically make a mockery of her great hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ok i try to stay outta this shite but whats wrong with saying all lives matter just an honest question
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think thats this whole subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i swear to you im not making this up im black btw and most black people i know dont even call white people white people we call them white niggas i only say white people around other white people and my parents but when im around my friends i say white niggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,european here so definitely not someone who sees things first hand only youtubereddit what is that issue you claim they are bringing up all i see is the disgusting vocal minority who act like animals what does blm say to these videos
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats why they are white lives matter now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,another high quality reply oh how i love those
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its pronounced nykas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because this sub isnt really about black twitter lol they here for the memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,perfect and accurate response just as much as white lives matter no more no less 😅😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uses nigga so you must be black and not some year old white kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,only we can say that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,s h i t p o s t
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know this is not a serious thread but i think blm isnt as helpful for that cause as all lives matter blm assumes an us and them dichotomy that is to say those peoples lives matter just like our lives matter its true but it kinda accepts and maybe propagates a distinction between blacks and whites in a way stop killing people you fucks does not i think modern feminism sometimes suffers in the same way if one constantly makes every issue about gender and goes so far as to try to lift one gender to the exclusion of another it inadvertently reinforces peoples view of division based on gender lines instead of erasing those lines and enforcing the idea we are all equal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,highkey envious when matt hit but i was happy for him at the same time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,might be the point but it is not the message they send blm is a gate group funded by george soros hell look at the idiot running on the football in a monkey mask guess what he was black if blm has to create a false narrative to get their point across then they have no credibility whatsoever glad i could inform ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats interesting funny enough i asked some of my girl friends just now and they said they wouldnt be happy if their man openly espoused being honey for another women they obviously know and accept that men are going to check women out be horny and think about other women but openly saying it in front of them they said it would upset them so its interesting that in your experience a lot of women do this id be curious to hear from other fellow female redditors and see if they do this ive never done this before that i can recall if i think a guy is sexy as hell and im getting all tingly down there i would keep it to myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not as dark as the skin of those nigerians who sold you to us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im just in here before this thread gets locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white women dont u be forgettin at least this last one is more a shawty than the other vanilla faces
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im saying based on their actions intentionally instilling fear in others they are asking for it dont try to relate this to victim blaming for rape cases you sick fuck that is exactly the logic people who say they were asking for it use replace fear with sexual desire and that is exactly their argument i dont think anyone is asking to be raped but if you wear a clown suit at night trying to get a reaction maybe its a little bit your fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ntentionally instilling fear in someone means you deserve to get retaliated against by said person so your saying that people can put down black riots by force if it makes them scared that doesnt make sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also because clowns dont have guns and dont drop it when the police tell them to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get down girl go head get down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for correcting the record
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just like the police on an unarmed black man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kind of ironic that hes running against the only person whos just as bad as him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dam you havent seen then warning extremely nsfl shows two beheadings one chainsaw one slow knife
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,with all the shit going down black people should know better than to leave their house and cops should know better too right right

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she has made mistake after mistake she is corrupt and a symbol of everything that is wrong with our politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meanwhile the black person is confused its like an endangered lion getting killed by a dentist you respond rip cecil the lion and a dog sympathizer says all animals matter then you say but what about cecil and they respond there are homeless dogs white people will tear up over this analogy but roll their eyes at actual brown and black humans dying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get a fat girl ask her what she wants idk buy her a salad results in months

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what if the bullshit i see is black victimization and black lives matter funded by george soros a literal nazi who is banned from countries for crimes against humanity and currency speculation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think there is any evidence i see programs like affirmative action in place against white people i see schools prioritizing skin color over merit i see people hiring based on diversity instead of merit i see the news talk about white privileged and white guilt while popular leftist figures demonize white people i see white people dragged out of their cars and brutally beaten just on the assumption that they voted trump i see obamas office staff was chosen by citibank who wanted no white men thanks to wikileaks i see popular feminists saying white people are obligated to not breed with other white people because caucasians are a race to be made extinct then i walk outside in baltimore maryland mostly black area and since im someone who passes for both white and asian the difference between someone who sees me as white and someone who sees me as asian is night and day now i dont think im some victim but im targeted as a white person in the city for being white frequently homeless people accost me i was forced to carry a tazer since i commute to college since thugs would harass me and one thing i noticed that was particularly interesting was people come up to me and ask me for a dollar or for change way more than normal especially before i started working out then you have groups like blm which is globalists manipulating black people to consolidate their vote white creating racial division intentionally there is a reason blms biggest funder is a fucking nazi because he wants a race war now i dont pretend to fully understand his intentions but im not going to ever see blm as anything but a terrorist outfit until they do anything but terrorize rioting destroying public property blockades in the streets chanting what do we want dead cops and disallowing white people to get to their classes at several universities they have no interest in legislation because there is no legislation to be passed to protect black people further because they are not oppressed i am kind i treat everyone nicely i am a good person i have intellectual conversations with people of all races and by the way many many black people feel the same way as me and they are victims of actual racism and persecution because they are called oreo and uncle tom for going against a hate movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious social media posts made by black people so glad we got that report link

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you dont give a fuck yet youre making multiple comments about it bpt frequently reaches the front page almost every day so to assume the same exact people are the ones commenting on a daily basis and that its the same group who hates kanye yet liked him the next day is erroneous to say the least i guarantee nobody who actually liked kanye to begin with ever hated on him for what he said because they would be the people who would have actually listened to what he said instead of just read a headline that says i dont vote but if i did i would have voted trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i give my seat to the elderly and handicapped they cant help it pregnant women time to pretend to be sleeping im not here to help you deal with your life choices

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey sorry for the off topic comment but id like to get this cleared up i posted this httpsimgurcomamkqemj earlier and it got removed for not being bpt when i sent a message to the mods asking why it was removed mod mglnn replied that it was because bardock obama posted it when i asked why that mattered considering his name wasnt in the screencap he simply replied latino i asked why this mattered at all when half the people on here are white and how a post of hilarys delete your account tweet hadnt been removed despite being against the rules on political content he just muted me so that i couldnt contact mods for hours i dont really care about the post being deleted but this seems like some bullshit behavior on behalf of this mod if it matters at all the post had upvotes so it seemed to be fitting right into bpt before being removed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sum seriously its gotten to the point that sum equals someone its just that difficult to spell out the word well when our society has turned into a bunch of illiterate dumbasses we will know at least one reason why and yes that pun was intended

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but like it is a shitty neighborhood tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,was he wrong tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i live in his neighborhood hes not wrong it is a shithole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when does calling something for what it is correlate to hate and division cant fix a problem unless you identify it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we all know chicago is a shit hole stop hating on trump and get on the train change is coming are you going to be left at the station
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair his neighborhood probably is a shit hole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe he shouldnt live in a shit hole truth hurts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe his neighborhood is a shit hole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,really you dont think it has anything to do with the main stream media at all or the dnc pied piper strategy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good hard truth dude acknowledge the problem then you can start fixing it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,figures that hes also a white guy ouch racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt seem so bad kinda seems like he actually wants to help black people hm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh so its in disputing his birth certificate which has now been proven to be false you think is the entire reason for the state of disarray right now also by calling him orange arent you making some kind of thinly veiled racebaiting commentary yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of the crimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry he has a different opinion to yours was he being racist no rude and blunt definitely thats how he rolls and has rolled since before hes not a gentle likeable snowflake like obama people typically love trump or hate him thats the type of person he is trump is a guy whose biggest contribution to the black community is not banning minorities at his golf club in palm beach in again your opinion and a misguided one at that the year when you couldnt insult any black people for anything without being called racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blatantly racist comments have nothing to do with equality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,which has zero affect on black youths today
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,next there will be people in here defending chicago and how its not so bad either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is it possible his neighborhood was a shithole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes been helping for years the media just doesnt report on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im saying slavery doesnt have any effects on black people not succeeding and should not be used as a cruch plus bpt is mostly ran by white teens anyways s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait so the inner cities and black projects around the country dont actually need help then which is it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyody hates fatties even fatties hate themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so your saying over the last years black people havent learned to read because of slavery
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not the one who is downgrading the value of black people you are i know plenty of successful black people they would never use slavery as an excuse for their lack of succeeding especially with the advantages black people have today compared to their past theres no reason anyone cannot succeed ah the blame white people for everything narrative never gets old i didnt know the walking down the street and getting pulled into a police car rate was so high i didnt read the story of the groups of white people rioting and burning black neighborhoods either i wouldnt discredit the tremendous efforts of those that have made black areas and schools better high and mighty lol because ive personally seen the success of those that work hard i just know they can do great things like all races unlike you why do you have such a bad opinion of black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jesus christ thats racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not doubting you because i dont really gaf either way but hat part of atlanta is fine no really just ask the people who live there asking people if their neighborhood is shit is going to get you the same replies as people who bought a product which turned out to be shit but they dont want to look stupid i could literally walk up to a group in the middle of torturing someone on the sidewalk and ask them yo you think this place is a shithole nah brudda this place is the greatest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean like when he won the rainbowpush coalition award for his contributions to black communities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how has anything he has said or done actually shown he wants to divide the country its all you liberals saying hes hurting your feelings and if you say its cause of the wall let me remind you thats for illegal immigration want to come legally no problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice talking points relevant but i understand youre still hurting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do you know hes racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wheres my vitriol the only vitriol i see is from you also why am i filth i just see that a sheriff has concluded the birth certificate fake and thought it important to point out given it was the crux of the argument i was countering
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice divisive language
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to stop an american city from being a warzone absolutely if theyre going to act like animals treat them like animals chicago is a disgrace
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol is this a joke lucky its not kid string you up so fuckin fast
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump speaks the truth though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,waaaa he called my city fit what it is waaa

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go figure vouching for personal accountability is very unpopular on a forum full of democrats
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anybody wanna join our plug and play some music httpsplugdjbpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you see it that way im voted in a way that lets me sleep at night if you dont have a solution id suggest you keep your criticisms sealed behind your ballwashers

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,africa is a continent dominated by packs of children following around year old white chicks apparently

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meanwhile obama spends his last days in office fucking up the country so trump looks like he did it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uh yea she was its was directed at black urban youths and was said to justify the strikes law
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,waternelondrea cant get any jobs though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol you tried
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if asian countries were being flooded by people from all over the world i doubt youd be advocating for their replacement know youll never be able to hear this but the current trend of mass immigration is replacing only one race of peopleyour people will no longer have a homeland every other race will continue to have their own homelands youve been led to believe that being white has no meaningful significance im begging you to reconsider that you might be wrong the survival of your people literally depend on it the information is out there its not hard to find youve been conditioned your entire life to associate anything pro white to be evil its false love of your own does not mean hate of others youre wrong about only stupid people care about this this is no longer about blind fear of the other this is about the survival of our own look up greg johnson hes smarter than you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thatheppened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean back when black people were bought and sold guys got black lives matter as his name and gloats about a win by default back when black people were slaves yeah savage

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hi oldyellow thanks for submitting to rblackpeopletwitter however your submission has been removed this action was taken because it has nothing to do with black people being hilarious on social media or the humor associated with it if you disagree with this action you can please include a link to your post so that we can see it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we shouldnt be encouraging this sorry i hate fascism neonazis and the altright as much as anyone else but trying to encourage a large uncontrollable number of people to punch others in the face will quickly spiral out of control
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets go race war
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good thing niggers already do the knock out challenge
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,punching nazis would be alright but knowing certain liberals that means everyone who didnt vote for hillary so it wouldnt be ok
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so much for when they go low we go high did they even go low no youre just attacking an old man for having wrinkly skin wonder if youd still be commenting on his neck skin if he was black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe you can find some more autistic kids to kidnap
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its very concerning how many here are seriously advocating assault im not sympathizing for anyone who doesnt accept equality but attacking another human unprovoked is never okay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the guy promoting criminal behavior is pretending to be morally superior cute
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black youth advocating violence you dont say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol what a stupid fucking strawman feel free to call nazi shitheads or whatever dont endorse violence especially dont endorse violence based on political beliefs when a rather dangerous man is in the white house

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah fuck them war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength diversity is unity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre too fueled on hatred to take the big picture i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nazis started as a reaction to something else just like everything else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who do you think pushed that communism who do you think pushed for communism in soviet russia who were the bolsheviks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tfw when the nazi shoots you because he values the second amendment and you didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nazi doesnt mean nazi anymore it just means nondemocrat voter

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its because youre allowed to be a bigot and make fun of white people which is fine imo but you cant make fun of black people or trans people or the mods will swoop down and call you a racist and ban you lmao the people on this sub think black people are oh so delicate and we cant say anything negative about their poor little souls
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its about time we had a black man on money
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats the point buddy your citizenship isnt american and were gonna deport you hopefully well get a chance to rough you up first
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hope trump deports that low iq negro

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is shit now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,put michelle on food stamps
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get ready for the well then she shouldnt have sent them replies this sub is full of disrespectful pricks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the tea in question was purchased by the british who wanted a monopoly on the tea trade the people who participated in the tea party were in effect destroying the property of their oppressor to send them a message the rioting you are equating it to is a fallacy destroying random property because of mob mentality is not at all the same thing as what happened in they are effectively destroying random peoples property but i suppose we could give them a pass because racism or whatever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people in did it so we can criticize it today brb off to go buy some slaves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rnotreallyblackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god this sub has gone to shit lately
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae wink
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont bring logic and facts in to this discussion s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unsubbed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bye deshawndra 🖐
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,xddd umad bro trolololo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what sub is this again i have to make sure i dont come back here overly sensitive twats rinning all over this place
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i doubt good ole mlk would have good things to say about the degeneracy of black culture lol go ahead punch a nazi get yourselves killed during a felonious assault and then chimp out about how racist all us white people are seriously you all need a reality check ask yourselves and be honest if all blacks left america would the country be better off worse off or stay the same our crime rates would drop astronomically wed save trillions not having to incarcerate your men and put your women on welfare i mean shit youre of the population and commit over half of all violent crime how do you justify that its disgraceful
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those are some nice strawmen youve got there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,apparently it is the place was made as a place for memes about black culture not as a reddit conduit for actual black twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not just those users a nonnegligible amount of active users here including mods feel this sub is supposed to be about memes and memes only
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpsiimgurcomaaogyp
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did the tea party post comments get disabled was it because people were ingaging in an actual discourse instead of just being a minstrel show
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree with you but the mods havent been clear with what they want with the sub i say this being an exmod myself the general consensus however is that the sub is supposed to be handled like a default sub so youre going to see lowest common denominator behavior here and according to some mods it was created not as a mirror of actual black twitter but more like a meme sub that just happened to pick black lingo as its desired coat of paint
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because black men notoriously beat women and become absentee fathers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they are though didnt you see the womans march looked like a poster for weight watchers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall really hurt out here hahahahahha i honestly had not seen how hurt yalls was yall out here marvin room on repeat hurt lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i still cant get over the fact that black people call each other nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my favorite part about the nazis rise to power was when the far left refused to compromise work with the moderate left because they were corporate shills counterrevolutionaries they also viewed hitlers antiestablishment rhetoric as potentially benefecial and his chance to alienate as a opportunity to motivate their cause now who does all that sound like to me kinda like the person who wrote this tweet lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah youre damn right im a white moderate thats why you didnt catch me calling cam newton a house slave like this sub when he critisized kaeperbick or john lewis a uncle tom like sandersforpresident did when he endorsed hillary its why you didnt catch me telling a veteran to go lose his legs again when he critisized protesting the anthem its why i wasnt stupid enough to vote party or write in bernie on election day all yall college liberal radicals black white gated community grown middleclass raised aint never hustle a day in their life motha fuckas can suck my dick yall motha fuckas so caught up in critisizing privelage that you dont realize that youre the most privelaged fucking group here thats why compromise moderation is so foreign to your bitch asses because you always got what you wanted when you wanted it demand politics must be the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there seems to be a correlation between obesity and radical political opinions in general just look at all those fat feminists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course also a correlation between fat women and people who hate men fat people are just born radicals no matter what side theyre on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just didnt occur to me since im not fat bearded or white dont really have a problem with feminists either just saying that it seems like a lot of the radical ones are overweight
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all yall neo nazis and white supremacists can go jump off a cliff unless you renounce your loser ideology youll be worthless your entire life you are not preserving white pride there is no white genocide and history will prove you wrong over and over again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you forgot your people on that list you know black folks is racist as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this isnt the kid the actual kid looked older judging from his instagram picturesim not condoning it just saying he looked like a swagfag pretty boy instead of a kid who sits around playing call of duty all day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whoever that kid was he had to be the luckiest mother fucker on the planet hitting that shit on the daily for like months yeah shes not a dime piece but her body was rocking but best of all she had experience think how much better of a lay she would be than the first girl your average grader would hook up with probably another grader with zero idea what shes doing this teacher probably just laid him on his back and made him a man the only thing shes guilty of is ruining sex for this kid for the rest of his life even if he never saw her again hed still be jerking it to her years from now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,number is actually black people aka savages

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,better never have a daughter dude you gonna change your mind real quick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ohh ok so since jokes happen both ways its acceptable got it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well that is just a terrible attitude to have about a social issue imo i was simply pointing out that it is a double standard that i dont agree with and i dont think people should make jokes about rape or anything of that nature because people go through it people can say whatever they want though just as i have the right to disagree with them such as in this case
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i was just pointing out that i didnt think this subreddit was an appropriate place to talk about issues like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look fam you think that you would be happy but let me break down what being a victim of female on male rape is like i will be describing this is the happy state of mind that you think you would be imagine you have sex with this hot ass teacher you finally get to cum and it is the best experience in your life you hit it raw and you feel like you drained your balls out you are in the bliss filled state of mind where your brain is full of oxytocins then a few days pass and your teacher tells you that she is pregnant what you say not realizing how much damage both of your actions have caused she is keeping the baby she goes to jail and grandmother takes custody of the baby while the mother in away the grandmother hits you for child support and it is granted httpsenwikipediaorgwikihermesmannvseyer you have to pay child support for your baby that you dont have custody for for the next years your parents have to take care of the child support once you turn you are incharge of paying for it you struggle to find a job that pays enough for you and the child support you now owe backed child support and the law is coming after you do to too many missed payments you are now sent to jail httpwwwnolocomlegalencyclopediajailtimeunpaidchildsupporthtml you finally get out of jail and now you are looking for a job you realize people dont really want to hire people who have been jailed you realize that the job market is at a difficult time you realize that you still owe a lot in child support the law is coming back for you you go to jail for owed child support you get out and realized that there is no way that you will be able to pay the child support you realize that you will be headed back to jail for the third time do to owed child support your rapist is now out of jail and she is sent home where she can spend time with your child you try to appeal for custody but do to your criminal record and economic status you are not granted any form of custody you go to jail again for unpaid child support your rapist gets to sleep at night in a comfortable bed next to your son while you spend your time in a jail cell i bet youre so happy you fucked that teacher back in grade

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are only three types the gangsta this guy listens to nothing but rap the kind that is soo loud and vibrates his shitty car soo much thats its unintelligible he leaves it on while he refuels at the gas station not to annoy everyone but to ensure that everyone knows how hard he is he calls everyone niggah regardless of their skin color he tries to freestyle but every line is about fucking dime piece white girls even though he only bangs fat ugly white girls he carries a pistol on him but he cant hit anything because he holds it sideways and never practices at the range the victim this guy honestly has no idea why hes been arrested soo many times he knows that smoking weed is illegal but thought it would be okay to walk into with a blunt behind his ear he doesnt understand why the cops had to beat him again last time he didnt even run as far as he normally does when they chase him he tells you hes constantly getting pulled over for driving while black but doesnt mention the fact that his registration and inspection are expired his tail lights are busted and hes actually a terrible driver the athlete this man has one goal and one goal only to make it pro it doesnt even matter which sport thats why hes on the basketball team the football team and the track team if he knew how to swim hed be on the swim team as well his gpa is a solid the bare minimum to participate in athletics but hes not worried his coach wont let it get any lower he is a star player after all you never see him wearing anything other than sweat pants its a miracle to see him at all outside of the gym he can be found chilling in the dining hall for several hours everyday though

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i still aint clear on how she can have a girl deepthroat her that math aint add up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes she refers to them as votes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,superpredators lets just agree that every candidate is shit just leave it as that theyre all fucking vomit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats that i dont speak welfare

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga thats a sticker you know you can peel those off right and whats with that pussypass shit tf outta here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats who im talking bout mate you paying attention you might be to young for these references ask your daddy bout super predators and the devastation of the black family oh wait

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahaha have you met hillary clinton shes as much an old white neoconservative scumbag as anybody who am i kidding ill see you in syria when its time to fight her war with iran and russia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i remember my first repost oh wait i dont do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah man at least for years so i can finish reading them emails

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah it wont be boring she will make conflict with russia keep that head in the dirt its done you well so far
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what always baffles and wows me is how much more physically capable men can be than women like some events the gold winning woman wouldnt even qualify for the mens race also wasnt there a data is beautiful post showing that most men are stronger than almost all women its not even a gender war thing to me i am just so curious how our species got here with such a big difference the only thing more amazing is how greatly any human can improve with just a month of training i think i could ourtrun or out fight any other girl in my office right now assuming we both havent trained but give her a month of training only days and she can flatten me any time obviously this is only talking about averages and between any given two people and there are many things that women are better at than men society also plays a role in women underachieving men in athletics and sports but i think there is no denying the natural physical capability differences between our genders and those really catch my curiosity on a scientific level edited a letter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont forget the shit shes done in the past friends shes pandering as usual and only cares about herself and the people funding her you got to think about how trump has made his life much worse by running shes a career politician whos some how beyond rich which is something you cant do unless your a crook no one called trump a racist once he wanted to help america though and break this corrupt system he was all kinds of things hillarys going to do what big corporations have paid her to do which is not good for the american people vote trump for a shot at something getting better millions of people sat in prison for insane amounts of time because of her crime bill but somehow shes above the law martha stewart went to jail for lying to the fbi once hillarys done that times check it out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rofl i bet all this kid did was reinforce her worst fears and now she can double down on her trump support cause she was right all along dumbass kid

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can someone explain this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,umm no freakin way they two candidates couldnt be more opposite one the right you have a loudmouth bigot who hates everything that isnt a straight white male with an inheritance on the left you have a hero who has shown time and time again that she has what it takes to be a fair and honest candidate for the people thats you the people not just the white ones shes kind compassionate and hasnt got an ounce of hate in her heart aside from that of drumf but who in there right mind wouldnt lel so if you see this post and think yeah theyre both the same but on different sides then youre dead freakin wrong we are making herstory this year real change real equality equal outcome for everyone not just rich white straight males vote for someone with standards someone with a heart a true american hero vote hillary clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think if anyone has made a deal with the devil its probably hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont care for the opinions of inbred drumfers take that mess up out of here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spiritcooking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did you just assume its gender cos we both know itll take off another mask and be a british reptilian spy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go vote superpredatortwitter you owe it to the dems for saving you from segregation also owe it to the clintons for the mass incarceration you must vote democrat for years at least almost like enslaved to vote democrats
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you gotta admit even donald is more attractive than hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,watch out for that spirit cooking hillary does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democrats are just using them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man wtf
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people acting like black people cant be supportive and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh boy i cant wait for this thread to e locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,always a house cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i was surprised that as a black person at least half my black friends are voting trump people i never expected whatever hillary did she seems to be making more and more black people suspicious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol na everwheres lolol spread the word
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aint gon catch my black ass there fuck this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,worse than that he just handed over even more overt surveillance state powers to trump by allowing warrantless data sharing from the nsa to basically everyone in government
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the last thing obama and the democrats would want is for there to be any visible problem with the transition of power but trumps going to blame the transition of power for the next years i can guarantee it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about civil rights leader attacks presidentelect and no one expects him to respond
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when did the holi become an entire weekend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama said trump would never be a president and look and that now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course its real everyone but racists respect and love mlk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump responded to a senator who was a civil right leader after that same civil rights talked shit about donald trump but idiots on this sub just want any reason to support their bias against trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump attacks civil rights leader responds after civil rights leader attacks him also when did mlk day become mlk weekend is mlk day a spoiled suburban teenage girl who eventually insists on a whole birthday week not to mention is he supposed to be immune from the results of his words and actions just because of this holiday is mlk month going to be like the purge where everyone who has protested racism gets to say whatever they want for the entirety of mlk season and nobody can call them out on it until the end of mlk year
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall niggas expect trump not to respond to shit talking because the shit talker use to be a civil right leader lil yall are a bunch of puppets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow how are you blaming obamas nsa on trump dudes not in office yet are you really that ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,civil rights leader attacks trump during martin luther king weekend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama in bullet from god
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes popped off on numerous countries via drone strikes for years obviously killing numerous amounts of civilians thanks obama 😘
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets just ignore the fact that lewis attacked trump first remember kids facts are meaningless when they dont fit the narrative trump has done questionable things but this is fucking stupid and is just circlejerking at this point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your civil rights leaders are morons
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so how is trump contradicting mlks vision there are hundreds of examples right would you please share say one or two of the most egregious examples
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn didnt know black people were immune to criticism on mlk weekend when the hell was this even a thing wish a got the memo wouldve phoned it in at work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,perhaps thats a fucking terrible reason to do any of this regardless because those laws are still in effect for any would be dictator to take advantage of after the fact even if that were true which fisa denying something yeah right even if it were true its creating a dangerous and permanent weapon to deal with a temporary problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not an argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yay more obama worship because hes immune to criticism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since your a poster to enough trump spam ill just assume youre running around looking for a political argument so you can call someone racist or fascist you people are just as bad as the donald assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not every protrump comment you see is a brigade
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama didnt have a congressman straight up say he was an illegitimate president days before he took office everyone was too busy slobbering all over his cock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this narrative that trump attacked him is getting old the guy calls him illegitimate and refuses to go to the inauguration without trump ever mentioning him trump defends himself and all of the sudden its trump attacks civil rights icon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seriously fuck yall if lewis didnt start no shit wouldnt be no shit race baitin motherfuckers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the road to hell is paved with good intentions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe trump supporters browse the front page like everybody else show me a shred of evidence this is a brigade
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no he got elected because people are tired of the politically correct walking on eggshells bullshit weve been putting up with for decades if someone acts like a bitch i want my leader to call them out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a reminder yeah right i bet he beats off to his agencies ability to do wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,almost all of this is torn straight from fake rpolitics headlines good job believing the lies youre fed hope you enjoy the next years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,u mad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this post was bad and you should feel bad op lewis is a moron and just because you hate trump doesnt make lewis some kind of civil rights leader
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sometimes i just go to thedonald and down vote everything im petty like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,weekend you get a day not a weekend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my ass hes gonna be the next black president will be viewed as one of those racists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being sued is not the same as being guilty try again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not a fan of trump but john lewis attacked him first
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go right ahead then and burn shit down expose yourselves for the animals you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump attacks trump attacks that motherfucker said trumps presidency is illegitimate that he does not recognize him as the president trump didnt attack shit he hit back and will always hit back one of the main reasons we elected him tired of pussies in office
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats only really if youre convinced that stop and frisk is an explicitly racist policy i dont know enough about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats retarded just because obama didnt say anything back doesnt mean future presidents cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what racist comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,does being a civil rights leader make you immune to any criticism the banter between lewis and trump has absolutely nothing to do with race or civil rights just another example of democrats being incapable of nonemotional arguments and im gay so if anybody disagrees with me theyre homophobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess so tattoos are harmless but shooting each other kid napping a disabled kid and rioting and destroying property constantly because innocent trayvon was shot because he charged a cop and beat him up yeah i guess we are crazy though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,martin luther king didnt write his own speeches either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,monster he killed commies dude they arent human
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who said anything about me the fuck are you even talking about bro lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is mlk month going to happen in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,settling on such a suit also doesnt mean that there was racial discrimination just sayin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hear ya mr squirtle just sick of the way things are presented in the media
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,saying something on twitter seriously takes seconds to do its not like hes spending all day planning his tweets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we simply see things differently i believe you are determined to see racism in everything some of the things youve said are outright false even
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what so if i had a business somewhere and had a sign that said no blacks allowed to pander to racist white people that wouldnt be racist which is besides the point anyway seeing stop and frisk and his birther bullshit had nothing to do with his business
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meh seemed like john lewis started it but whatever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,attacks points out facts regarding the above average state and national criminality and poverty rate of the congressional district over which the congressman who is protesting his legitimacy as presidents elect repressents without any alluding to race at all same same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you people 🙄😔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black kids shoot just as much its just that white people actually go to school and thats where the stereotype comes from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you think that most of anything politicians put on social media is written by them the fact that they let it go up is all you really need
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where the fuck this bitch learn to meme like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres a reason nixon pardoned the draft dodgers man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for sharing those links i gave em a good look i am not in favor of a police state or of big government in general in particular the war on drugs has been a major offender in strangling freedom and creating criminals in the us that being said the issue that comes up here is whether or not youre assuming something is racist simply based on the current realities as opposed to some utopian vison after all isnt it possible that in nyc blacks and latinos perhaps owing to the history of racism and discrimination actually do commit the lions share of crime and that they do deserve to be stopped and frisked more often simply as a matter of circumstance the date is pretty clear black males commit an overwhelmingly disproportionate percentage of the murders in the us if this is true you would generally expect to see them discriminated against in the eyes of law enforcement a parallel example is crime rate between the sexes men are incarcerated far more often than women and commit far more violent crime would that mean that our justice system is misandrist or that its simply dealing with the reality of the situation of course in that last example the primary cause would be biology instead of culture an error i see in our popular culture again and again is the pattern of identify some disparity income incarceration etc assume that the issue is simply a matter of bigotrydiscrimination signal your virtues as a warrior for social justice and condemn in broad strokes the group that you proclaim to be the bigots its like people are just insisting that there must be no difference in reality between any group vs another sort of like pretending that the world must conform to your perfect ideological vision and if it doesnt then there must be something wrong with the data or some evil is being done to some poor victim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,smoothing doesnt work bashing does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its obama who is fucking everything up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the democrats level of delusion has reached insanely new heights
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the liberal mindset
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reread my comment you sound confused
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not sure what you mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah both comments that arent completely shitting on trump are definitely td brigading
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what do you not understand theres thousand subs on thedonald you think its out of the realm of possibility different users happened upon this post which is on the front page of rall youre right terrific detective work i browse there regularly and have never seen this sub mentioned let alone a specific post actually linked to do you even know what a brigade is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kinda like the stereotype that black kids are dumb gangbangers who harm innocents in drive by shootings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its almost as though i dislike both of them and am not blindly loyal to one of our two parties
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,her frame of reference is not in this reality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mlk many of his supporters at protests were black kids which means they werent going to school checkmate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah judging by your responses in this thread you are indeed triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shhhh you arent supposed to post things that are logical in liberaldemocratic subsi mean on liberal reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair lewis came at trump first
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,typical liberal bullshit implying someone is gay or racist because they dont agree with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a controversial shitpost there are just outright a lot of trump supporters on reddit protrump comments in any thread outside thedonald doesnt equal a brigade like i said never seen any mention of this sub show me a shred of evidence of brigading
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was citing an article that said of women crossing the border illegally were sexually assaulted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you retarded he tried talking shit its just too bad he ended up looking dumb for doing so but sure hes just so classy and cool as he signs one last order further expanding the power of domestic surveillance days before changeover
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit i worked today can i bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uhmm okay im not sure you responded to the right comment if you did respond to the right comment your response is a logical fallacy known as a
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obamas a little too busy rushing laws into place to erode your civil liberties more and increase domestic spying to take pot shots at trump but thats a little harder to tweet isnt it trump is awful obama is also awful just more popular and way better at hiding it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre right and thats your opinion if you dont like it obama is more of a passive aggressive back handed snake
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems accurate though source not a libtard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so if he states something related to race thats a fact then its racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because its summer time and you can party and bbq all weekend its fuckin jan no one wants to party and bbq
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im the one triggered eh so stereotypes against whites are cool and funny but if you switch it around the person has to be racist or butthurt gotchu
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the civil rights leader attacked him first get it straight
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i really just think the sudden wave of antiobama stuff is obnoxious partly because a nobody had this much bad shit about him at least not nearly as much as before since maybe the past month but mostly because b theyre never issues particular to his administration just to the war on terror if you think any of this kind of shit is going to end on the without some kind of major uproar or people not resorting to terrorism i think your mistaken mass surveillance and drone strikes are tools of our current wave of warfare if you think theyll end with obama or trump or whoever is next your head is up your ass farther than anything umglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is such the fucking opposite of how shit is going down no matter what the hell trump does obama tries to be as divisive for the country as possible and he tries to make things as rough as possible for the transition ie the sanctions on russia the antiisrael resolution his claim that trump won solely because the election was hacked etc and lewis yes he was a civil rights leader in the but he attacked trump and his presidency and trump had a right to defend himself no mattered who said it and since lewis decided to spew his garbage on mlk weekend trump had a right to deliver his defense on mlk weekend it doesnt matter who the hell lewis is if he says some bullshit he has it coming to get called out for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey agnostic liberal here the dnc does need to do some soul searching because telling wallstreet to cut it out aint getting the fucking job done and they sabotaged a man who genuinely gave a shit about the working people because its their job to need grassroots movements from taking over even now they would rather continue losing as they fight sanders tooth and nail than turn on their corporate masters its why theyve been focusing on identity polythene so much because it allows them the illusion of giving a fuck while not actually doing anything meaningful for the vanishing middle class the democrats dont give a single fuck about you or me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i never really understood this part so can someone explain hes saying that mostmany illegal immigrants coming from mexico are bringing drugs crime and are rapists iv read that article zannyth mentioned as well as others which say of women coming over the border are sexually assaulted but there still seems to be a lot of back and forth about this statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being a civil rights leader does not make you immune to criticism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have no idea what youre asking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whyd you just link a video proving my point in a tone that indicated you were arguing with me he seems on the ball about illegal immigration issues cheers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama ruined that smooth transition when he blamed russia for hacking the election
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ok so i commented on someones comment from another thread and got sidetracked i was wrong you cannot read properly you are also wrong you dumbfuck bet you talk this kind of shit in real life keyboard warrior
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uh not how that works kill yourself please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ushookone just one of the worst kinds of people oh but who are we kidding you wouldnt care if your mother took her own life the inconsiderate bitch probably eats meat so her death would probably save hundreds of animals worlds better off without trash like her and me right

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and of course the lmao at the end of the joke because nothing says you got jokes like you laughing at your own
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all black maybach but im not a racist was your sergeant dating hov
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lowkey means under the radar or in such a way that you wont alert other people to the fact that something is happening the alternate meaning is that youre embarrassed to be white on bpt and need to throw in some good buzzwords to hide that fact fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rwhitepeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably gonna need a back up guy or maybe a whole team he constantly spews idiotic bullshit cant stand his coon ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey everybody hes black and from the south so he absolutely is an expert and knows every single person south of the mason dixon line we apparently need go no further for an absolute truth about racism in the south btw im asian so ill do your math homework for you once im done with my cold fusion research and designing a universal theory to fix the whole physics issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he said lol you wild wyd tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the little fella probably would have gotten employed too for not having an intimidating name or something like that 🙄
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow youre a thristy hoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah black women have always been good a track
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except shes said that she is disappointed and has lost hope for america is that seriously someone you want in office someone who is ashamed of their country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats fine youre allowed to have your personal feelings and ideas but the majority of americans would likely not vote in a political dynasty as proven by this past election especially not the wife of the president who has presided over one of the most turbulent times and has created the worst race relations in modern history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ahh there it is good old fashioned name calling the trademark of a leftist whos run out of cogent arguments yes obama has caused serious damage to american race relations when he was elected many reported racial unity to be at an all time high now were on the verge of race riots because of obama and the lefts divisiveness and race baiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you realize that this sub just as racist at times right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no homo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah calling like it is as long as his voice is the only one he deleted my post actually hilarious anything that doesnt agree with him he just removes it lmaaaaooooo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate these stupid maps there are plenty of conservatives that live in those blue states and plenty of liberals that live in red states i live in new orleans of us voted hillary but fuck me cause i live in louisiana no fuck you for being a simpleminded idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe she wanted a man who would help her raise their kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama has called his wife michael whens the last time you heard a man calls his wife by the male version of the name i really dont care if the first lady is really a man but it opens up the can of worms on what else they could be lying about i expect downvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think calling michelle obama manly makes someone a racist you can criticize a black person for something without being a racist people like you take the teeth out of the term racist if im a racist for calling black woman manly what the fuck is a kkk member am i as bad as that person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit like this is why trump won calling half of the us not america just shows how intolerant and stupid the left can be people are fed up with being shit on for their opinions and pushing this narrative of only acknowledging blue states as part of the us is dumb we have a united in our name for a reason imbeciles
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do you guys think you have a chance with girls who reply like this they obviously dont like you so just move on would you really be happy dating someone who is nean to you and ignoring you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone believes it but theyre racist if they say it theres a reason the belligerent black woman stereotype exists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,could it be because unlike all women whiteblackpacific islanderasian their shoulders are head widths wide instead of or that they both stand heads tall instead of heads which is standard for all women blackwhiteasianpacific islander no its obviously just racists s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre a great couple im happy for her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well they have no futures so
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol then leave bitch dont cry about shit only to continue living like you always have
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well maybe if yall didnt lock all of them up for petty shit all the time theyd be around american justice system is fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unfortunately there arent stats that can support it but my personal experience has been that black women are a lot easier to set off as far as the stats go though the deadbeat dad stereotype doesnt apply equally black children are more than more likely to be raised by a single mom than white children its a problem across the board but its definitely more prevalent in demographic than all the others
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am hear on comments to understand what the fuck this clown is even saying thank you for clarifying this murky picture of a perspective that i have no will to fully understand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the problem is what an absolute spit in the face to your ancestors also mixed kids have major identity issues stick to your own kind imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course they exist but we arent talking about crazy where talking attitude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pages no make your point with a simple click link source or bye yet another sign that racist thoughts come in part from willfully ignorant mental laziness
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get the humor its just a guy wearing hoop earrings can someone explain

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the same reason plenty of republicans still will vote for trump when both of them are god awful candidates they believe they are picking the lesser of two evils shame this is what our election process has become but hillary is still worse shes basically pushing for saul alinkys view of what american should be
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then you need way more than a something like that in the picture

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i get more props for stunts than bruce willis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what are you talking about she feels like she deserves love regardless of her weight whereas she refuses to love someone solely because of their weight thats the definition of hypocrisy and your example is not analogous at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,abortion african american holocaust
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what he was describing was partial birth abortion instead
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when the topic is the emails that pertain to national security and classified information and youre trying to bring up a joke to a friend about sexual assault against women

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bill clinton is a rapist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao well it can look like one talk like one and act like one but it isnt one sorry if your fantasy are you like attractive heshes then more power to you but that kinda suspect that you dont want the real authentic thing im telling you i wouldnt idk how that hard to understand with the plastic surgeon that have out here now it hard to tell but if you find out and you continue down that road then youre definitely suspect as hell lol nice try falling back on the youre not comfortable with your sexualality jab it not going to work here partner i find people like you very hypocritical because if a women said she wasnt into girls no one would questions that but since im a guy and i say im not into that heshe bs somehow im not comfortable with my sexualality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just remember when you talk with your friends about grinding up on drunk women in the club it is sexual assault because you literally press your cock against their vaginas and they let you do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,too bad this wasnt handled better its a topic that resonates with the africanamerican community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and black people are voting for the candidate responsible for naming them superpredators and causing the unfair treatment in court literally reaponsible wrote and passed the law it like they love jail or something love subjugation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah literally nobody related to this fucked interns in the oval office and gave them a pearl necklace with his semen literally nobody then lied to the world live on tv that he didnt right this sub is cancer but thug cancer its much worse and when you kill the cancer cells with chemotherapy youre labeled a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,has everyone forgotten the sexual allegations to bill clinton allegations on an incompetent man who likes to talk vs proof time and time again of corruption and deceitfulness evil hilary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more than but lets say for a moment that youre right and only of the nation infact support him that utterly negates any argument that any support of him is the result of brigaders btw you should probably use a throwaway before lying about politics on reddit your creepy as fuck post history kind of discredits it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whatever you say man considering the fucked up things youve posted about before youre in no position to judge you should really start seeking psychiatric treatment before you act on that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people should really stick to posting black comments on twitter they know fuck all about almost everything of substance which is why they burn and loot their own neighborhoods shoot their people and blame everyone else but themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nignogs dont know how to look outside the box
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree with you but playing devils advocate here what if a beautiful man hating that hes beautiful because idk maybe life is complicated as a beautiful person is not allowed to be not attracted to beautiful women does he have to become unbeautiful to get the women he wants
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the founder of oculus tried to make it a thing us trump supporters who enjoy thedonald refused to be paid to support our candidate we shut it down as soon as it started we believed the only donations should be given directly to the trump administration oh and the nimble america thing it was going to be for paid adverts not for paid shills please do not confuse us trump supporters with the illegalhttpwwwfecgovpagesbrochuresnoticesshtml act of paying influencers who do not disclose so many americans are discontent with how disconnected our politicians are with the average worker and increasingly those who cant find work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,repost
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you have no idea how much time i have spent explaining this to people i have stayed up latei have typed for hoursi am getting pretty tired of all this i dont have the time effort or energy to do peoples research for them anymore if you want the answer to these questions then go find them yourself it is all public and at this point you dont even need to go digging through the emails yourself you can simply google it ill post a link of the google search for you the only one im going to give you directly is a pretty damning one anyway i am so tired of doing this for people so im not going to put any more effort into this do your own research or dont i dont care anymore remain willfully ignorant of wikileaks revelations i dont care anymore too tired of proving people wrongdo whatever you want
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,serious q just so i know and hopefully it makes it clear for others just got removed im assuming repost because i think ive seen a similar version but on a different meme so does that still count as a repost

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a prochoice site for percent of the users here quit circlejerkin and put your dicks away you hypebeasts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is possibly the worst argument that is widely peddled on reddit its like saying dont like isis go over to the middle east and fight them or else you dont really care do you its the worst way to argue about a contentious issue and its just terrible that people still spread this crap around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre a rich white male for the rest of us voting is pretty much impossible if you can manage to become a registered voter you still have the armed nra nutjobs camped out at polling places and your mailbox to intimidate you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hivemind is strong in this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but we cant have arguments that show prolife people sticking to their beliefs and being good humans how can we possibly brush off their arguments without attempt at debate if we dont paint them as evil people who dont actually care about children
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well he could be gay there are plenty of reasons beyond being a paedo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i cant imagine too many people in rblackpeopletwitter would be pro forced labour
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly whenever i see a political post its almost always mglln it gets kind of drawn out i just want some dank posts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit president and hoe ass first woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youd ever been around or talked to a bunch of prolife fools youd realize that they are a huge adopting demographic and foster parenting among that group is on the rise recently but as a mod of a sub called rwhitearecriminals i imagine you have a hard time with reality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but everyone here is white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope i seriously feel like black people only like him because hes black hes literally done nothing for this country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,life is sooo hard lets all just feel bad for each other its not like people have done this for thousands and thousands of years and life is easier now than it ever has been in the past
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the election is coming up so people feel the need to screeaamm their opinions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt want a black foster kid either what would happen if i lost him at night and didnt have a flashlight id never find him i guess i could just head towards the direction of car alarms and glass breaking its so complicated
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall dont really want it now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you get an abortion for being irresponsible then you should get sterilized forcefully

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hmmm may be a candidate for rquityourbullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hell no ma boy jakewonner packing heat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it would be more relevant the other way around to be honest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its funny a handful of black people are shot yearly a smaller number than the number of whites shot by police by a handful of police rarely do the shootings turn out to be unjustified and it means all police are racist out of black men under the age of will spend time in jail yet it doesnt mean there is a crime problem in the black community sjw math got to love it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,almost everyone on this sub especially you is white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,inaccurate not funny and a shitty attempt at trying to divide the country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,by saying theyre black are you implying they are suspected robbers with felonies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cops shoot people because theyre black or is it because they were resisting arrest are suspected robbers and have multiple felonies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone that while this is a humor sub smh then tell umglln to stop spamming it with non humorous posts its especially annoying since hes the same guy that regularly rants at people for race baiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude are you dumb you saw a video clip that completely ignored the bulk of the incident with that logic if you saw a video of the twin towers coming down after the planes hit youd just assume they caught on fire by themselves there is a huge chunk of the story missing and everybody is so quick to judge everyone always says oh the cop killed the man without a fair trial he was innocent well apply that logic to the cop wait till the facts are out before you go calling him a racist pig
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,way to often name cases where a cop was proven in court that he murdered someone because they were black good luck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you saw a video of the aftermath you missed of the incident if you really know why the guy was shot with proof turn it over to the feds so they can properly punish him otherwise youre making assumptions to fit your agenda

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,statistics ive seen so far dont support systemicinstitutional racism there is disproportionate crime especially concerning is violent crime there is disproportionate enforcement in correlated response to that crime i beg you to not dismiss any facts because the moment your agenda drives you to mock and dismiss facts is the moment your agenda lost touch with reality

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf please tell me youre as white as people say bpt mods are and arent actually both a person of color and ignorant about what happens to other people of color in this country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the libtard part of reddit almost all of it is currently doing a thoughtpolice blackwhite on the election the real sensical joke would be to say she won the popular vote but since reddit wants to continue a satanic inversion of reality caused by the msm and marxist conspiracy here we are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean after he was winning the entire night until california came in where illegal aliens are allowed to vote do you actually believe the president should be determined by urban california and new york alone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,even if you genuinely believe that no illegal immigrants voted are you saying that hillary got pummeled on account of the fact that the majority of voting americans voted against her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the race wasnt for the most votes so donald had very little ground game in new york or california because they are blue states hillary clinton wasnt campaigning for the most votes she lost to an outsider donald didnt need to cheat to win but you can tell yourself whatever you like during the next years hopefully she doesnt run again doubt she can take another loss
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub has black people in the title but of the posts are about white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre surprised to see a radiohead mention on a sub used primarily by white people

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it minorities didnt speak up against the media chris pratt would be wearing black face right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,us wins gold in racial inequality name one other country where blacks have it better blacks grasp at straws trying to find racism in everything the reason she got media coveragetaking your word for it is because shes an established athlete and olympic figure as opposed to some random guys from a sport called shot putt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a strawman quality work they are both choosing not to do a thing they are free to choose not to do i have never heard anybody not have the same opinion on both instances if someone has and i dont mean news sources saying someone does i mean someone saying those two are different i would love to hear it you either think thats fine because you are free in this country or you think its a slap in the face to soldiers or something show me one person who actually thinks that those two things arent the same and ill completely change my tune bonus points if you can show me someone who isnt already and outed massive racist because nobody is saying the government is run by guys who think lynching blacks is a good idea at least nobody sane
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im having a hard time differentiating between this sub and rtumblrinaction these days i usually have to go to the comments to see if the picture was posted honestly or ironically 😐
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how you insinuate black moms are the equivalent of black fathers norm mcdonald commentary would be its funny because black dads are often not living with their children see its because its uncomfortable and true thanks norm

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where does one get weed for a apple pipe for science
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man you cant post this kind of stuff on this subreddit its basically a roleplay sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpsiimgurcomggxfjqsjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have a weird feeling that the people who put the caption who did this are actually the ones who did it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who did this the fuck you mean their name is on the top right corner smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah so many american culture thingies i cant relate to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they dont air nickelodeon in the ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot of things here have more or less sipped into white dutch culture actually i briefly did lower education vmbo for a while so thats why i get black culture hows a guy like me supposed to know whats so funny about mixtapes until another less educated white guy explains it to him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i assume most people here are whiter than i am
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do you know this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is no such thing as black culture in higher education at least there isnt here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes yes i am like i have literally no reasons to deny that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol black people dont care
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was a negro in the enclosure they shouldve shot him instead of the gorilla
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,harambe dindu nuthin

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall niggas want some pie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,apeexcellence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is at least half retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gorillalivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do black people identify with apes is it like self racism blm was all up in arms about the gorilla death until they found out it was a black kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its funny that its racist to put black people and apes in the same sentence but when an ape gets shot yall act like he was one of your brothers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair to grandma i kinda see the resemblance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so its okay for black people and people pretending to be black to make these jokes comparing a gorilla shooting to the shooting of a black person but when white people do it suddenly they want to bring back slavery this is why blm isnt taken seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get it can someone explain why his wearing a square academic cap
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,foxnews would have made more sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he dindunuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fact that black people are blatantly admitting that theyre apes 😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gorillalivesmatter only a matter of time before the gorillas burn everything to the ground and start assaulting other primates whoops typo that was supposed to be blacklivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre next bitch

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how did the kid even get in there that shithead bitch mother is the reason that gorilla had to die fuck her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reddit is pretty dumb in general but the suburban teenagers that infest this sub are a special breed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you forgot that the gorilla was with a white kid otherwise there would be little backlash tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your post is 🔥🔥🔥 fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tomato tomato
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres more than black people left though same cant be said for the gorilla
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you let your kid fall into a fucking gorilla enclosure because you are too retarded to watch your shitty spawn you arento blame

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spongegar be dat nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she purple
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this a case of a black person comparing black people to gorillas man thats racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rwhitepeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its definitely making feel differently about this sub like i know everyone jokes that no one here is black but its actually starting to feel like the whole sub views black people on twitter as a minstrel show fuck i hate to be in agreement with azaleia banks over anything but to paraphrase her its all good when people are laughing at or enjoying the culture and humour of black people but let there be a serious issue regarding any black person let alone black people as a whole and suddenly theres a problem with the race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn fam thats that shit ion like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right just look at ferguson hedindunuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,english translation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre the kind of mother fucker that empties an entire sugar caddy on the table and asks for lemons so you can make lemonade and not pay for it fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtheydidthemath
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that or rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course someone would be mad about actually tipping someone on blackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but he left for cigarettes years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its the only way to get black folks to tip be real
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not sure but it looks like this might be more of a case of convergent evolution distantly related species in similar niches developing similar features than a transitional species not that its not an awesome example of evolution nor am i saying that there isnt overwhelming evidence for the fishtetrapod transition but i believe that the transitional species were lobefinned fishes that started by propping themselves up and then walking on their pectoral and pelvic fins sometimes i just like to come to this sub an drop comments from other subs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,niggas college attire lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,definitely not gumbo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,titties are best but answers to tests are also good
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,impossible black on black crime doesnt count because then they would be at fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dunno go ask your friends on tumblr
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuckin bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do black guys love to cheat so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sad part is that cheating side females etc is like a normal part of life now infidelity is ok and funny now aint that a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah sometimes they arent just memes i know plenty of people that are actually like this these stories come from somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf is that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its not lil wayne money changes everything oprah hasnt been oppressed in so long she forgot she was black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we cant all be a shitty quarterback and still make dollars a year while crying about how blacks are treated unfairly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sooo whos the oppressor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im going to assume this was taken out of context and this is some academic exercise in morality theres no way this is the full story
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no there needs to be an organized effort to overthrow the racist capitalist state and the police as a result there needs to be another rainbow coalition
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well i mean if you want to deepen the racial divide sure remember what it was like when white people were actually racist you probably dont because you werent alive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you have several misunderstandings going on here this misunderstanding well thats a generous term the fabrication here is that theres an actual problem in the first place blm doesnt care about white people shot by cops of which there are far more than blacks shot by cops you want respect and caring how about not flaunting your complete lack of it in reverse and while were at it why am i supposed to care about the black suspects killed by police every year when you show a shocking lack of interest in the black people killed by other black people every year just a few days after michael browns death a gang shootout left blacks dead just a few blocks from there and no one said a damn thing i find that amost impossible to believe a black year old in a spiderman costume was shot in his own back yard by a pair of gang members and no one would talk to the police about it your lack of empathy is appalling cant help but notice that kaepernick couldnt be bothered to talk about these either its easy to dismiss blm protesters and disparage them but now if even the rich and famous are willing to stand up and say somehing is wrong then maybe people will pay attention yes it is easy to dismiss blm protestors because they call for the murder of cops and then it happens pigs in a blanket fry em in bacon calling for murder you dont deserve any respect caring attention empathy etc despicable all those who say protesters are thugs cant say the same for someone silently protesting without displaying their weak arguments this is a logical fallacy people looting burning down buildings and attacking police are thugs period people that protest peacefully are not theres no weak argument one of them is one thing and the other is another thats the idea behind peaceful protest its irreproachable thats why it worked in the and why youre failing so miserably now well one of the reasons the other reason is that the narrative of half these socalled martyrs is fabricated from start to finish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i fucking hate this sub as much as the thedonald now bro in the past few days ive seen can called a houseslave ive seen anybody who critisized kapernick deemed a racist by the same hypocritical people flaunting his right to critisize ive seen disabled military veterans dragged through the mud for critisizing him fuck whitey upvoted to the top and you know this is the same shit i saw happen with berniebros during the primaries black people who voted for clinton basically being called fucking dumbass children who were lowinformation and voting against their own interests that white southerners who voted for her were exconfederates i saw as cornel west insulted both president obama as the first niggerized president john lewis a civil rights icon as basically a uncle tom race traitor because they supported clinton and its the same type of purity test radicalforradicalssake bullshit that trump is using that people like mao mussolini used people like yall are the reason mugabe ate his own yall are the reason malcolm huey were eaten by their own the polar opposite of mandela mlks rhetoric so on some real shit as for as this sub thedonald go i hope both yall racist populist fucks win gain power and then i hope i have a frontseat view as you first destroy each other and then destroy yourselves and most of all i hope i survive it all so i can bust a nice fat nut to i fucking told you so
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in the past few days ive seen cam called a neohouseslave ive seen anybody who critisized kapernick deemed a racist by the same hypocritical people flaunting his right to critisize ive seen disabled military veterans dragged through the mud for critisizing him fuck whitey upvoted to the top of shit and you know this is the same shit i saw happen with berniebros during the primaries black people who voted for clinton basically being called fucking dumbass children who were lowinformation and voting against their own interests that white southerners who voted for her were exconfederates i saw as cornel west a name referenced here often when people talk about being woke encourage that berniebro shit i saw him insult both president obama as the first niggerized president john lewis a civil rights icon as basically a uncle tom race traitor just because both supported clinton and its the same type of populist purity test radicalforradicalssake bullshit that trump is using that people like mao mussolini used the type of shit powered by a mob mentality the type of shit that every time its gained widespread traction in history has resulted in lynch mob to get rid of counterrevolutionaries in the ranks to keep the movement pure purge all who talk of moderation compromise or bipartisanship people like yall are the reason mugabe ate his own yall are the reason malcolm huey were eaten by their own the polar opposite of mandela mlks rhetoric
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean when there was actual segregation jim crow and the like when there were laws on the books that were racist you even admit yourself its better to say all white people are racist whether they say they are or not helps literally nobody it creates a double standard the tulsa race riot that was actual racism and a lot of these shootings arent even racebased more than a few times in addition to the most recent it was a black cop shooting a black person and yet you have people calling for the murder of white people a veteran of the philly police force a black woman was murdered wheres the coverage of blms opinion on that you want the countless numbers of blacks killed by whites thats what all the hubub is about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,strawman alert meanwhile it is easy to protest as a rich man being paid to do so how marginalized can you be at that salary are you actually going to try and make that argument i wish youd try if for no other reason than pure amusement and politicians tend to be professionals at spending other peoples money so thats kind of a tangential issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,here is what i do not understandwhy do black people feel like they are the only people who have ever been enslaved im english and german and i know for a fact that the romans enslaved hundreds of thousands of people from both those areasbut you dont see all englisg and german people constantly bringing it up and bitching about it or asking italy for reparations im not sayig slavery is rightbut if you havent been a slave then what gives you the right to be salty about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why is it ok for black to have solidarity and say black power and have black pride but if a white guy is proud to be white then he is a no good racist im extremley proud of my ancestryenglish that dosent make me a racist i have zero problem with anybody being proud of their ancestry but this seems to be a double standard that is just accepted because people are so afraid to be labeled a racist its like if ur a white male ur supposed to feel guilty i didnt choose to be born white anymore than anybody else chose to be born in to their race or creed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please its ancillary if you dont think the prevailing argument is all white people are racist i have a bridge to sell you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre right that nigger deserved it hint thats what you sound like in this situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pssh like slavery was just something that happened to black people in america nope its a worldwide universal thing that has happened to people of all races and colours ever since one tribe from wherever decided life would be easier if someone else tilled their fields and built their walls so why shouldnt a white chick present on slavery not like black usa has a monopoly on talking about slavery
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he gets away with it because the people who find it funny are white nigger isnt a funny term no matter whos saying it or in what context
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so is this baby gonna get locked or
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,slaves had freedoms in the us they were usually allowed to marry visit their wife on the weekends etc if you treated your slaves too poorly they were at higher risk of escape and revolt stop spreading myths
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,while i believe that the police forces in america need to be reworked this is horribly skewed most countries dont have close to as many people as america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats where most of the population is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ahem its called a metaphor but as someone who obviously didnt pay attention in school or know where his dad is to ask him i dont expect you to get it i wont be going anywhere or doing anything you tell me to do ever because quite frankly you are an idiot learn grammar learn english and learn what a metaphor is then come back to me when you think you can sit at the big boy table thug
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are out because your ratchet ass got owned just like you are with the dollar i dont see you offering to take the challenge just a bunch of chest beating and jumping up and down bye felicia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why would anyone cum in that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but white people as a whole are not your opressors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that picture is ridiculously misleading the data points shouldnt be fuckin circles they should be actual points or dots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he said sorry though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga moments cops are the number one killer of black people behind pork chops and fema

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white parents have their kids at a more appropriate age like mid to late twenties early thirties as opposed to when theyre like black girls thats my take on it anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,deaf and dumb sucks to be you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres a reason waiters dont like waiting on black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes the kind of black woman you marry smart not sassy or ghetto basically a white girl but looks black perfect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its saturday so p good thx for askin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,statistically you should picture black chicks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also have them out of wedlock and with reliable partner
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get this stereotype niglets are the most disrespectful shits to their parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black racism theres no such thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its something about white people waiting to have kids till they are further on in life rather then the stereotypical yr old black mom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wonder if a white person made this same video about blacks if they would be labeled a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,extreme racism in what regard hiring based on skin color homophobia how by paying homosexual actors for entertainment xenophobia is a misused word in usa progressives examine your values in the exact way conservatives have been forced to you will see you are only antiwhite not progressive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if only all black women were like her itd be amazing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is so fucking gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whenever i read things typed out like this i like going back and reading their other comments to see if they really type like this heres another fun quote from usaltiestsalt it really sucks but i try to go to bed at pm and its really worth it because im not tired when waking up heh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no you idiot urbanite im saying it implied rich white people are mean to their moms what you said in your last post that i was replying to i know you like to chimp out in class but you dont need to do it on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if it makes you feel better he likely committed the murders the trial was bullshit though he didnt get a fair shot at any sort of defense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is possibly the whitest thing ive ever seen on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres a real push to associate black with homosexuality im not here for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because of this picture of something that happened years ago yup very rational
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there for me raised me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub getting fruitier than tropicana
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you think america is more racist now or when the civil rights movement started and if so how did we get there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pretty sure this story is bullshit son buy yourself something nice with that you deserve it corny ass line straight out of days of our lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i question their dedication after she had a damned concert for hillary clinton and clinton still didnt win
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,excellent comment you really contributed to the conversation with this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,touché it works for many rich and almost exclusively white men folks sorry i have to do it no matter how on point and nonbigoted your post was ps all republicans are bigots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont fucking care
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you thought hilary gave a crap about the constitution youre fooling yourself also in what way did trump violate the constitution maybe its reddit that needs to read the constitution
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who gives a shit lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you say people are racist due to subconscious biases please provide evidence you claim an over all trend of white privilege exists please provide concrete examples of white privilege existing and also that it is common please explain the concept of homogeneity in greater detail and provide evidence of it existing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,off the top of my head and keeping in mind i voted for clinton and would have voted for sanders if he won but the republicans were sitting on a vault of oppo research at times hes been an open socialist and supported openly socialist policies like a percent tax on income over a million bucks he didnt hold a job until he was when he was elected mayor he didnt vote until he voted for himself for mayor he wrote a lot of creepy articles for weird leftist magazines he praised castro pretty openly he went to cuba to try to meet him he honeymooned with his second wife in russia did i mention he was divorced or that he was a deadbeat dad cause he didnt hold a job until he was in his entire legislative career he passed three bills where he was the primary sponsor two of those named post offices he has a really really long record of pretty much only hiring white men to work for him the women he hires get paid considerably less than the men his wife bankrupted the college she was the president of and got a huge payment on the way out he pushed to force a nuclear waste disposal facility on a primarily latino community in texas then got his wife on the board of the facility he voted against the amber alert system hes on video tape calling bread lines a good thing that should be enough for now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when does having black people equate to a good cabinete trump could hire another smuck who happens to be black literally nothing will change
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hmmm i wonder how much you would doubt if he was brown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you do have to wonder who was paying to feed and clothe his child while he spent working exclusively as a volunteer filmstrip maker for a tiny museum
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit after what happened tonight in berkley i dont blame him for trying to get protection people were pulled out of their cars and beaten i can understand not liking trump but that shit is getting out of hand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if a black kid was browsing a gun store online during class i would be concerned too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats pretty racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpsiimgurcomamarvxfpng
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did they use such a sweet picture of trayvon martin though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,beyoncé trash this isnt a funny meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what thats a straw man if ive ever seen one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just like those gentle giant photos of michael brown and those innocent photos of trayvon martin as a little kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racism isnt some novel idea that was invented by the trump republican party you have to ask yourself why is the liberal media bringing it into the forefront now why now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when will black people in the us get rid of their victim complex
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i disagree
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the altright has always been a pejorative term invented by the msm think for yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont get me started on hillary supporters look how much protests have been happening that were anti trump related how many of those did damages to businesses yeah lets talk about trump supporters s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,altright as a term was literally invented by cnnap to label the trump movement its just libspeak
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how hard is it to realize that maybe youre just out of shape and have a shitty personality hell i realized that senior year of high school and worked my ass off to change it and it workedtoo well because i keep getting stalkers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what happened to the funny memes tho guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,never heard of him outside of cnn rpol and right now pretty telling imho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how trump supporters can be you mean like the anti trump people who at calu beat people unconscious with metal poles the best approach is to mind your own fucking business buying guns in the country is a privilege and not illegal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more americans are killed by minority violent crime than any other unnatural cause
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the embarrassing part is it took you this long to realize your lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i want to say that more americans get killed by black people that get laid than white americans that dont but that would be too easy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that is the most cucked statement ive ever heard no wonder trump got elected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more americans are killed by african american criminals than angry white teens who cant get laid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so trumps cabinet represents the american demographics significantly more than obamas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so hating on whites is cool but not other races cool blacks are more likely than nonblacks to commit murder httpwwwunzcomarticleraceandcrimeinamerica over white women are raped by blacks every day in the united states africans have higher rates of a gene associated with violence

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly this sub is the only time i see racist shit but when you mostly sub to niche subreddits that maintain a non toxic community that are more concerned with posts relevant to their hobbies and interests instead of political shitposting for an ulterior agenda youll notice a difference
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but youll never notice when cnn exaggerates the shit out of everthing and gets folks all souped up until you find out a few days later that u were manipulated and used as a tool by your beloved liberal media had to be said turn off the news and think for yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ill take white guy with a legal gun any day over a gang of stupid black thug culture adults with illegal ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cnn loves race baiting though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,even more are killed by black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,said the guy living by himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives dont matter tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what cnn loves turning everything into a race issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fuck its been the opposite for at least a year now man claims he was robbed at gunpoint was it racially motivated school eliminates afterschool programs targeted at black youths white man lives was this an act of racial hatred man seen wearing white robe is the kkk on the rise in america theyve been pandering to the racial divide for a long time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ironically enough the reverse is true few months ago when they beat that white kid and were yelling about how they hated white people as they beat him cnn showed the clip and said doesnt appear to be racially motivated like wtf bruh did you not just watch the clip you showed lmfao goons
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah cnn is the exact opposite of this post when the chicago torture video came out cnn was like police are still trying to determine if this was racially motivated seriously they were yelling out racist slurs saying f white people and beating on a disabled white kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everybody else is gonna see your contact name has been added or has been added and say whos
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so long as they arent you know muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm beats up man while yelling get em hes white could it be racially motivated
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo this bitch was annoying me while i was doing something im going to shoot up my school i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but muh narratives
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah they care a lot about racism towards black people because thats the only real racism right guys hehe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not at all true im probably the most liberal person i know i know what trumps all about but i also know what hillary clinton is all about as well and i was just so damn sick of people refusing to see her for the compulsive lying arrogant sociopath that shes always been trump aint no prize either and isnt at all qualified to be president but ill take anything over hillary clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sometimes the wrong people can say the right thing though it really doesnt hurt to just diversify our news sources and keep our guard up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck does that even mean like if i punch you in the throat that is getting shit done but you probably wouldnt be happy that i did it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wolf blitzer and now joining us to discuss the dangers of a war with china we have world renowned astrophysicist neil degrasse tyson esteemed rapper snoop lion hiv positive actor charlie sheen blackuweather forecast meteorologist ollie williams and the guy from the truecar commercials neil in the grand scheme of the universe we are but a speck of dust charlie did someone say angel dust snoop those chinese are dangerous cuz they got that karate and shitforizzle ollie erybody gon die truecar commercial guy and with just easy click you can save over off msrp on a new car
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,illegal immigration
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah itd be real terrible if you had to actually consider the viewpoint of someone who doesnt agree with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cnn also said trump would never win and acted like the election was a shoein for hillary the entire time unbiased fair media would have never said bernie wasnt a serious candidate especially since you see how that worked out for republicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so he didnt deserve due process
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honest question why are people freaking out over this sure its cool and im happy for them but why does anyone actually care this much what utility does the fact that a celebrity is having kids provide them with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes still knockin around though right ive seen a few videos of him on rall not saying hes gonna fix everything but if he talks to his followers about this shit maybe some of them will listen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm in toronto is a hate group 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet people like leslie jones who tells her fans to cyber bully random people she doesnt like isnt banned
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,now say something like this the next time some black dude gun someone down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real i see more people angry on this subreddit reddit in general i guess about everything than i do in real life i wouldnt have even heard about the santa thing and half the other things people complain about if it werent for this subreddit memes and titles are 🔥 tho so its ok
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,massuhs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont think too far past your iq you obviously dont know shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the crazy thing is it doesnt matter anymore everyone lives inside their own echo chamber and assumes the worst about the other side
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is definitely some form of confirmation bias
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its even more awesome that moa is owned by jews merry chrismaka everyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre literally talking in memes what are you even saying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kill all white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,crazy that a white person probably wrote this comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,santa crause
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not a matter of prejudice against any race its the change from a traditionally white character solely as an effort to be politically correct would people of color be upset if luke cage was portrayed by a caucasian
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,which white people you talking about we dont all look the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because it didnt hit rall good luck defending white people unless you have the rest of reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its the new way to spread hate you gotta point people in the right direction somehow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its pretty fascinating how pervasive this problem is its the same problem that applies to redditors yes some redditors are definitely in favor of extreme racism and kiddie porn and whatever other horrible shit this website get associated with but many and almost certainly most arent redditor describes a really wide group of people just like white people and black people do its way too big of a demographic to reliably apply these stereotypes to i mean to be clear the joke in this post is fine and kind of funny and not at all offensive but its definitely factually incorrect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that is as dumb an argument as moderate muslims should call out radical muslims guess what they do its your fault if you dont pay attention to them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt hey thats not quite right hue its a joke dont you get jokes have a sense of humour oh haha you mean like some black peop reeeeeeeeeeee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,literally never in my entire life have i heard anyone say something like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont start with this bullshit this subreddit is literally called black people twitter the implication being that all black people act a certain way not some black people twitter obviously its all in good fun so no one points it out its really funny actually every time i see a post that stereotypes whites i know theres going to be at least a couple comments from offended individuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone here is white gotta be i dont know any black people whove played blood borne fact im black and ive played it i dont know who i am
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn are you trying to appropriate european culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id eat her cookie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,come on man were trying to be angry not sensible
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this doesnt matter but in that one harry potter play hermione was black which i thought was really weird
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this its a petty thing but when tolerant lefties just does it out of spite to prove how tolerant they are it pisses me off santa is supposed to be white you dont go and make a mlk documentary with a white actor nordic finnswede
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reverse racism nah although its less common racism is racism even if someones white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey bpt thinks its funny when poc appropriate white culture but try casting a white male in a film about ancient egypt or some shit and watch the media have a meltdown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets be honest though black people are hella racist too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like that a couple days ago reading through some of the comments in that thread is actually quite sickening notice how everyone talks about how racist she is but not a single person could come up with a single quote to prove that she is a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol piss off
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,atlantas black people are back as fuck the beneath the surface racism is annoying see how racist you sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a white person i wish santa was black maybe then id get weed for christmas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i didnt mean sickening comments per se but that it was sickening to read how people around here are trying to make everything into a race issue people in the thread are throwing around the word racist apparently without needing any evidence people seem to jump on the bandwagon of hate without even stopping for a second and questioning whether theyre actually right or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,die today please kys right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ur gay and you make us honkies look like fegs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because we are always in defense mode because we have to be or our peers will call us racists black people can say what ever they want about white people and its usually taken in jest not so for us honkies standup comedy is a perfect example of how society looks at whats acceptable to say from each race it just is what it is

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah you have no clue what youre talking about homeslice youre even playing little bitch games lol i use reddit mostly for videogame info and the occasional waste of time at work trust me im not a drug dealer but please believe that i dont need you to tell me about them lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im curious on what happens if just hear me out what if trump puts jobs and pride back in some of these communities strengthens the racial ties and makes good progress i know where the humor and talking points are but i want to see how much fun we all have if somehow he turns things around those jokes would be the best
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not sure if dmv slang or jamaican patois excuse the ignorance all i know is this lil niglet prayin his po heart out solicit the prayer warriors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,xxxxl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but pretty soon hell be putting on a reverse menstrel show where he sings in white face and performs skits with dave chapelle who is also in white face the delusion is for real hahaha kanye is smart according to everyone here so he was able to see past the tabloids and meet the person in question he just noticed the press is full of bs and the trump that got elected president is not a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i come here just because i speak fluent ebonics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why to send a message lmao send it to me if you dont want it fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dope
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as opposed to hilary clinton who loves black people so much that she brings a bottle of hot sauce with her every where she goes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kanye is such an idiot and his fans are even more annoying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its cool that he actually wants to discuss politics with our presidentelect i was disappointed with the results of the election but its time to at least attempt to make trump work for america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because he definitely didnt make a promise that he would build a border wall to keep the mexicans out im mexican and i agree with trump illegal mexicans should be deported back the us receives dailly millions of mexicans that work there illegally but whats interesting is those mexicans come back to mx after their work and spend their dollars here how am i affected its impossible to find a place where people charge rent in mexican pesos everybody wants to get paid in dollars and of course hundreds of people here ilegally make dollars by working there and living here they are making it way harder for the people that like to do things legally if the world was an utopia in where you dont need papers to travel and the world is your home then id say trump is an asshole for wanting that wall but the wall works perfectly fine with the structure we have now the only thing he would do is turn a fictional wall into a real wall the wall has always been there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its because trump hating black people was manufactured
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whom tryna send me nudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nagger stop nagging me on the internet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh yea i forgot money makes you racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and they try to say theres not a problem with violence in the black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he in college he might be but you clearly arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kanye is a trump supporter i hope that fact ruined your day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about we get someone sane from the black community to speak on our behalf we dont get anybody to do this nobody has stepped up but kanye yall are so blind to hating trump that you dont even realize the risks hes taking by doing thishe met with the man our soontobepresident about improving multiculturalismand youre already calling him batshit crazy no wonder no one else has stepped up you wont even let them speak
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he literally just told yal what the subjects he discussed with him and you all still mad at him trump is president now whether we like or not its fact the only way to move forward is to work together
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat you mean thousands of people are agreeing with someone defending one of the most famous artists in hiphop color me shocked mother fucker people get thousands of rts defending people like michael vick and chris brown that doesnt mean its actually common it just means out of the billions of people on the internet a couple thousand agree with them which isnt really saying much

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ice cube is about as fake as a fake ass fake can be ol round head ass nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it should get ugly people are actually dying and this racist group mocks it this is one fucked up sociopathic shit hole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well if youre black but youre on this sub so i doubt you are you should definitely care increased violence against police does nothing but fuel further violence cops will increasingly fear for their life and that may inspire them to make rash decisions out of a desire to save their lives that ends up with a potentially innocent person killed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought it was a refernce to the cop killings as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks but i swore and im sorry for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there were a response to hundreds of years of islamic conquest where the civilized word was conquered this is absolute bullshit youve never read the koran or the bible rbadhistory
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly these people are buffoons who only play the victim card
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but why are blm supporters killing white people and pillage stores isnt that going to make the situation worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more like an only at the end of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao like black lives matters gives a shit about muslims
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,statistically they would have better luck if they gave a fuck about black on black murders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut the fuck up with your politics holy shit this is black people twitter stop being a sore loser about the election didnt your parents teach you how to be graceful in defeat stop saying alternative facts giving the word liar a fancy new phrase doesnt make random hes lying shes lying any better look at cnns gigapixel photo it goes all the way back looks like youre the one being lied to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bo burnham yo fellas dont you hate it when youre sucking a guys dick and he ends up being a faggot am i right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is why blacks are hypocrites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,backs commit a statistically disproportionate amount of crimes so who tf else are police going to have conflict with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seeing that now nevermind folks we are not all equal carry on with your racist echo chamber
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but theres no looting or rioting going on with the muslims right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats literally every source then just because you dont want it to be connected doesnt mean itll stop being connected whats next religiously motivated crimes dont count because it wasnt organized seriously dude some of the shit they do is rascist and heres a good way to see how big pieces of shits they are go to google type blm then go to videos and see how many good things they do that bring peace and awareness and progression to the table
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i understand the reasoning behind the movement but black lives matter is open to people interpreting it as only black lives matter as well as any other interpretation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the people who knew that everyone already knows that black lives matter too so saying black lives matter is clearly not simply saying black lives matter too no one thought black lives didnt matter blm means certain people should be able to do whatever they want and face no consequences
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why are you even on this sub lol im on this sub because im here for humor not douchebags pushing their agenda why are you on this sub if you say all lives matter you should probs be upset when some of that all is being treated unjustly i am unhappy when people are treated unjustly i just dont see it as a circumstance of them being black like all the other racists pity pandlers and facebook activists that do every race gets mistakenly shot that kid with a wii who got shot at the door by a cop didnt generate any activism it was just an unfortunate story that people forgot about the week after you know why cause he was white but if he was black media racists and facebook activists like you would be talking about how it was racist of the cop to shoot a black kid im also upset at domestic terrorists like blm who riot use their race as an excuse to misbehave as citizens and blame white people without evidence take darren wilson for example the racists at blm lied and perjured themselves in order to get a conviction forensics said that wilson did not shoot michael brown execution style yet several black citizens perjured themselves in order to convict a racist cop furthermore im also upset at blacks vs cops narrative when most cops are good people im upset at the racial divisions that are appearing in this country as the media constantly pits black people against everyone else im upset at the many policemen that died as a result of the blm matters message and the painting of cops as pigs you know those two cops that got in brooklyn thanks black lives matter but all lives matter isnt about improving anyones livelihood its about delegitimizing black lives matter black lives matter isnt improving anyones livelihood either its driven racial relations apart caused several cops to lose their lives resulted in rioting and has just been a source of contentiousness throughout the nation but like they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions theyve committed multiple acts of terrorism in our country all lives matter is about actual equality if you are against that then you are the real racist here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre not going to like this but when you consider who is more valuable to society is it the person that owns multiple companies that they started from nothing the person that cleans floors serves fast food works retail does data entry etc youre comparing someone that has rare skills and can accomplish things no one else can to someone that does something anyone can do after all if you were capable of being rich you would be anything else is an excuse if you need proof start laying out the reasons why you arent rich and start asking yourself why until you reach the logical conclusion youll find that youre the one in your own way but this will be downvoted because none of you will bother doing that and thus youll stay poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think blm is a racist supremacist movement but i am against this muslim ban im also a jew
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,getting pretty circlejerky in here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all lives matter except blacks get a job u coons
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and the black lives matter as well all i see is a sea of white people rn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,point me to the blm march for iran
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does this have to do with blackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,feminists in general are fatter uglier and worse mates whos really not having sex with who
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah no more no less than white lives or yellow or red or offwhite with a hint of caramel or whatever the fuck it does not merrit rioting in the streets ruining your communities further when violence against one another is most prevalent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we just going to ignore that black lives matter fucked ferguson baltimore and charlotte
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all lives matter is a not so secret way to say white lives matter the people who say all lives matter are not referring to mexicans or middle easterners and they are only begrudgingly including black lives i am so god damn fed up tip toeing around racist fucktards on the internet rthedonald is pure racist cancer lets stop pretending that it could possibly be anything different i dont give a damn if i hurt their precious egos by telling them that they are morons who chose a moronic president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more or less the movement blm has become rather than the statement that makes it hard to follow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,terrorist lives dont matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody on this sub is black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck muslims
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought i saw black lives matter people beating up white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a person who has been called altright numerous times this isnt true if anything the left sjws radical feminists blm supporters are much more prone to this behavior however not all of them i am a bisexual and mixed race and normally vote democrat however this election i got tired of all the corruption and general bullshit that the democratic party was involved with so i voted for trump as soon as i made this known on social media i received countless messages telling me that im a racist homophobic misogynistic altrighter neo nazi that should kill himself i even went to a trump rally earlier in the year and met some very kind and loving people sure we didnt agree on everything but they still treated me with respect however if you disagree with a liberal they will turn into a child and throw a temper tantrum call you a white supremacist and then block you when you bring up valid counterarguments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god this is such a stupid circlejerk people use the all and blue lives matter is reactionary to what appears to be a wholesale movement against specific groups all lives matter was pushed because people thought undue emphasis was put on black lives blue was pushed because people thought undue hate was put on cops whether its right or wrong it doesnt take more than a cursory glance to get the real motivation but im sure you already knew that stop pushing these idiotic fringe beliefs of a conservative movement or dont bitch when they paint all liberals as marxists rad fems and white haters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice strawman you got there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives matter is not interested in equality they are nothing more than a clumsily organized black kkk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives do matterto blacks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only people that have a right to be in this country are its citizens everyone else is negotiable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets see if i get banned for this then ahem white lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,me thinks you are taking wlm too seriously um they take themselves very seriously wwwwhitelivesmattercom they want to murder mixed race children to stop mixed race propaganda from spreading and causing white genocide as a black person married to a white person excuse the fuck out of me if that makes me just a tad bit nervous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,years to this year yeah is the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice strawman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are black muslims too is blm out protesting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what no black muslims oh shit yeah i forgot blm only come out when the riots are about to start so they can be first to loot that fresh pair of jordans 👍🏻👍🏻🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are saying that anyone who supported all lives matter is an incorrigible racist as if its just a matter of fact its pathetic that you honestly think that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats happening to this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they dont have sex they only get raped
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if black lives matter so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,until black lives matter can publicly denounce some people using their movement to be blatantly antiwhite and antipolice and make addressing the inner turmoil within the black community of how blacks are more likely to kill blacks then i just cant take them seriously systemic racism what about places like detroit where fore decades africanamericans have held a majority of the high seats in public office mayor etc yet homicide rates increase black on black crime still increases black lives matter needs to be about a movement for black people to realize they matter to themselves and to stop blaming problems on anyone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives matter is a terrorist organization
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives matteronly if shot by white police officers the other black on blaxk homicides a year arent the same its comparing apples to oranges and if you think it is a problem youre a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah this definitely happened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ehh not really not that it matters at all but i think if someone were to see jesus theyd call him arabian or white israel had a lot of contact with the paler mediterraneans to the west especially greece and i think we have reason to believe that the semitic ethnicities of israel were lighter than those of today
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mostly white i think i found it tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because islam is a religion not a race and white isnt an ideology
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,name one american who legally owns slaves that is still alive thought so this sub is the trashiest most fetid miasma ever bunch of trashy people hating on whites because muh slavery which im not a personal victim of because it was made illegal hundreds of years ago just change the sub name rcoontownreversed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you spelled white wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people are the most boring unattractive race if people out there i dont understand the superiority complex at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all you guys are fucking crazy if you think because im white i should feel at all responsible or even guilty for the slave trade my great great great great grampa wasnt even born then you fucktards alligning the civil rights movement with the muslim and refugee crisis is totally unfair one is a relgious issue the other a race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people probably look up to this person you underestimate the power of communication and are flagrantly closeminded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i read all of it and understood how its attempting to be so enlightened and observational the tweeter isnt some pioneering vanguard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god damn you all are desperate and bitter even the funny response got downvoted relax and breathe this isnt as bad as the media says it is i thought blacks didnt listen to the media and instead each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pretty sure a very narrowly owned media is harming our democracy jeff bezos is pissed at trump because he wont be able to use a loophole to lower american wagess and is venting through his newspaper after years trump is going to be a net plus for people who actually do work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,delet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait first of all what i should have said in the first comment was secondly was it a guy or gurl im confused
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine being black and thinking your life matters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but isnt that what blacks have been doing for decades constantly reaffirming everything you do based on the color of your skin because you have no real intrinsic value to society i honestly just laugh at this point blacks have nothing to offer to society your black president is gone and youre all flipping out because your gravy train of hand outs is over time to gain some real skills black people because niggerdom is over
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people have the worst skin of anyone on the planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappended
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck white people kill all of them they all supremacists thats why blacks superior cause they always bigger and stronger
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but you are asserting that whites have privilege where is the privilege for those millions of whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,orchestral music came from black people europe had no music until black people came along at least be accurate in your hatred of white people i know you hate us im not going to try to stop you from hating us but at the very least dont be a retard about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nephew
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,still not a muslim ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine knowing you have an entire continent full of your people and theyre still living prebronze age
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats the most compelling evidence someone can give besides the unsubstantiated allegations of his divorced wife that bannon is a white supremacist or is this just a circle jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre not attempting to call out racism they dont actually care about that its pretty simple how this sub works black is good white is bad thats it you dont need to concern troll about them being racists they dont give a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking gallowboob
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,still looks better than your average black person all around the world white skin is more desirable thank dark skin this is just a fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not thedonald i post there theres a difference between being called out and being brigaded if you were being brigaded we dont brigadeit wouldnt be just me sitting here calling you out for being racists do what the rest of reddit does and ban me for being a thedonald postercause thats certainly tolerant and progressive and inclusive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre probably racist anyway this is what got you trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jazz is most likely what hes referring to or maybe hip hop and rap since thats what the majority of americans listen to these days whats he done is he took a point that in certain contexts makes sense and then he took it out of that context and made himself look like a retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that is literally what black culture is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because garnering public favor helps any cause if its for a good cause and the movement conducts itself in a civil manner more people would be more open in supporting the cause it opens up more avenues to more people but if youre doing shit to piss people off why would you want to be associated or support a group that does that it paints the movement in a negative light and loses supporters shuts down the connections and makes it a divisive cause
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure smells like selfloathing in here reddits suburban larp fantasy sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when you generalize a whole group like you just did by saying god damn whites it makes you just as ignorant as this ass clown in the picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine having no written languages no technology getting enslaved your neighbors sold to europeans contributing absolutely nothing to the world and then acting as though you are equal to whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what are some good examples of him being a white supremacist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres absolutely zero proof that he is hes employed jewish people hes employed black people this thread is retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,found it in rall i guess what led me to white nationalism was the fact i live in atlanta and when i discovered the facts of racial iq differences it clicked even then i didnt care it was when i saw the estimates for whites becoming a minority in their homelands land soaked with the blood of their ancestors i decided to do something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,multiculturalism is being forced on every white nation except for some in eastern europe there is massive demographic replacement going on all over the west whites are just expected to take it or else they are called nazis nobody else is expected to do the same nobody has a problem with a japanese ethnostate the reason the west is successful is because it is full of whites once whites become minorities in their own countries youll see the standard of living go down the toilet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youll gladly stereotype poor white people as being racist but god forbid some white person stereotype black people in any way whatsoever and they are immediately a racist and youre too fucking arrogant to see how youre the one perpetrating racism

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats good all deaths matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree this one twitter story alone is reason to completely change our entire nations foreign policy i say we bring these immigrants immediately to chicago and detroit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,posts like this sure help heal the divide and not further it s every one of these threads is just a circlejerk for people who already believe this shit and for those who visit and dont its just a huge shove to the right from the left when will you realize youre hurting your own message with posts like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no this httpimgurcomagvnqz
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah there is no sub which shouldnt have antitrump content as its top posts right now its our duty as americans to fight intolerance reddit as a whole should be dedicating itself to mobilizing against trump and getting people to vote democrat in
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,went from chills to just crying im a regular poster on rthedonald i dont care this shit is magical
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,keep on forcing the propaganda reddit admins
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because in the black version of history every white person was a violent racist slave owner apparently
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they do realize the arab slave trade lasted longer and was far more brutal than the atlantic slave trade right not to mention the atlantic slave trade isnt thing anymore while radical islamcrazy ideologies is still a very real threat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im really sorry how some people get treated by some others racists are truly the shining gems of our side
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right and if a black man calls another black man a renegade nigga thats obviously because he hates black people and wants a pure white race fucking mental gymnastics youre willing to do to avoid facing reality classic leftist logic where any black man who disagrees with the narrative is an uncle tom any homosexual man who disagrees with the narrative isnt a real homosexual and any jew who doesnt fit the narrative is an antisemitic jew its pathetically sad guy literally has devoted most of his life to judaism and youre still willing to argue hes a closeted antisemite its fucking pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shhhh its name sajs black so by current year standards everything posted here is exposing the evil hitler trump and worth × more than what cis white males say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heil hitler
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,has this sub turned into rpolitics now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and fuck the people who voted for hilary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its always fun to hide behind the but the rioters are not with the blm movement over and over but at some point youve gotta realize the blm movement is almost always prevelant during these riots and the riots are often held out by angry young black youths calling it how i see it as a baltimore area resident the blm isnt inheritely wrong or anything but its more than a coincidence that bad shit happens at or around those rallies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,repost
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey can you pm me because i dont like you and i want to block you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also fuck the people who shoved hilary down our throats pretty much handing trump the election

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you too you fucking uneducated faggot supporting clinton just because she is a democrat is stupid she has a record of horrible judgement horrible decision making abilities is soft on terrorism a supporter of breaking americans privacy and is untrustworthy sanders should have been the nominee i went with gary johnson because fuck clinton and fuck trump fuck the dnc as well sanders should have been the nominee plain and simple once clinton got in i knew we were fucked regardless of who got in
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this isnt true at all op is an idiot

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there it is literally hitler its important not to cry wolf at least people are right about richard spencer being a nazi but save the literally hitlers for them so theyre more effective
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what evidence am i missing of bannons nazism maybe i missed it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,atlanta has a huge african american population if you look up std statistics try cdcgov african americans are far more likely to game stds
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably because sjws interpret it as racist when its unequivocally a fact ironically its the discounting of this fact or ignorance to it that perpetuates the racial difference when it comes to stds if people were aware that half of black women have genital herpes they might decide not to risk it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pouring your time and energy into another mans child child will never see you as a father constantly have to deal with childs real dad know she will go running back to her babydaddy as a snap of his fingers there are plenty of women who didnt get knocked up by some random dude why would i knowingly get into a relationship thats gonna sap all my time and resources when i could just pick someone who wasnt a fucking idiot

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how they talked kanye literally said i just want to the a picture he didnt tell everyone how trump is god and how he is the best thing ever people like you are the reason that people are racist if i see black men as thugs and someone like kanye said he wants to talk about shot that matters and actually has a real dialogue with me how can i stay racist if we understand each other then we wouldnt have to stereotype each other all the fucking time oh ye met up with trum he a house nigga now thats what all the dumb ass niggas yourself included have been saying i met with kanye west and he had a lot to tell me about teachers salaries and how we can work to combat inner city crime i really enjoyed that i guess all black men in baggy pants are the criminals im going to autograph a magazine for him thats probably what trump might have said after meeting with him im black so dont get it twisted but i fucking hate you crab in a barrel ass niggas man i swear its like you cant win if you dont have a job youre broke but if you have a shitty one then youre a joke the reason blacks wont get anywhere is because if cornball shit like what you said like what the fuck should he do ignore him and everyone who can get shit done while still calling for help in the community how in the fuck could they know how to help us if we dont tell them you niggas be acting like a bitch in an argument sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,read my comment bruh these niggas tripping
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is lol only reason i stay on it is to read all the salty comments of a bunch of idiots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont feel bad saying that that reflects the general sentiment of bpt dancing around calling him an uncle tom or just straight up no longer a black person because of his favorable opinion on trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres wrongs on both sides here but for hillary supporters to say they want peace this is a violent way to get it they call trump racist but hate white americans assuming they all were slave owners they call trump intolerant but cant handle the fact that their candidate didnt win and throw tantrums i am not american and i feel this will be down voted because many in this sub wont have an open mind to see this from a different perspective
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,donald is da best 👌🏻
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,liberals still salty that their free hand outs are getting taken away and theyll actually have to work for the first time in their lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shhhh i want him to keep feeling this way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump is racist for meeting with prominent members of the black community reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee muh racisms
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,typical hilary voter doesnt help person which other political view as a trump voter i wouldve helped
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,may the white guilt be with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets also not forget about libtard and pervert anthony weiner who actually did send explicit messages to underage girls on several occasions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i fuckin hate trump but you are a genuine twat if you dont think clinton has already done some pretty horrible shit shes pretty damn racist too right down to the bills that she and her husband pushed during his presidency you know shamelessly arresting and imprisoning more people overall but particularly minorities excuse me being an aggravated prick but learn to judge a little more fairly unfortunately trump was elected fact how about continue with the democracy you have and make sure your electoral college rep votes another way this childish antagonistic mentality is run on both sides and you guys need to cut it out i never knew how true the statement high school never ends was
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like the multiple peope who claimed trump supporters ripped off their hijabis never happened they all made it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what did he do that dehumanized you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the muslim registry thing isnt happening anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre literally being racist with this comment assuming the person is white for being a trump supporter im a trump supporter and my wife and i are both halfmexican i was actually raised by my mexican mom in a mexican culture i dont judge anyone for being white or brown i wont stop to help you though considering youre racist towards my white half also for the record theres videos all over youtube of trump supporters getting attacked at rallies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,illegal immigrants donald j trump also most not all donald j trump we are legal where do you live by the way my guess is no where near the border
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what is he supposed to say we need immigration reform because too many great people are crossing the border illegally that would be false if you lived in a border town you would know that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i would call the kkk but the democrats lost

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this whole controversy seems like some made up shit maybe im just ignorant and i dont spend too much time on social media but i dont see anybody saying she shouldnt be in the movie people love to picture some angry racist white person rocking back in forth in a dimly lit house clenching their fist because some slightly tanned chick is in a big budget movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all of the comic book subreddits where on this complaining about how shes not a redhead or about shes biracial and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rule umglln youre a mod you should know better than this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all ive seen is people being ashamed by lochte and maybe one post about gabby and even then i think that was a suggested post by a new outlet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mglln is the nigga sittin there being passive aggressive tagging posts with shitty titles but he gets away with it cause hes a mod like what kind of title is this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol this one is ironic as fuck considering hillary clinton advocated for and still speaks in support of her husbands landmark crime bill which put million of more black men and women in prison than ever before many for minor offenses and is considered by many to be the single biggest case of institutional racism in the us in the post civilrights era
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont even start
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone was once a white swimmer though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one source defended him white privilege

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt would have been angry at people jumping to conclusions before all evidence was released then once it seemed clear it was true the story would vanish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i remember when bpt was just funny shit instead of whining bitches and beta white males itching to show off their white guilt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ha yeah and we dont know what hillary would do either so do you see how silly that argument is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,idk i wouldnt be surpised at anythin that sociopath would tbh lol

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when hes called on hes got his game on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he also stated its good to play for a team who wants just for my sawed off
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and in the glorified ghetto slums such as south side chicago the crime rate takes a sharp increase especially because gunshots sound similar to fireworks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought he was my dad because he left and everyone was saying he was coming back soon but he never showed up

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if she im 😝💦
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when shes a she and also not a total asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not trying to be original and i know theres no point in arguing my point because this sub is toxic when it comes to pointing out hypocrisy just saying that these types of threads are literally always locked because white people arent allowed to defend themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whatever you say man like i said no point in trying to defend myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahahaha how the fuck is defending yourself on the internet real haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he din do nuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id still hit goddamn that racism and disgust is just extra spice i know its a problem but my meat wants what it wants
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub man i didnt know black people did this emo white garbage i didnt realise this was a black trait likewhite kids get bullied at school they either kill themselves or shoot everyone in their class lol black kid gets bullied either gets the fuck on with it or sorts it out i thought this sissy thing was a white thing misery loves company and why are we wallowing about having a shit love life and having depression in this subhis sub should be making fun of whitey and saying funny shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i feel like kidz bop volumes were a creative low for the series its almost become a parody of itself im hoping kidz bop vol will breathe new life into the franchise and return to the sweet spot that was kidz bop vol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its alright none of them have jobs they have to go to in the am anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have no idea what this post means
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id love to just watch this chant inevitably die out and see their faces as they all realize theyve accomplished nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because there isnt already thousands of police on police shootings in chicago alone this year oh shit i must be a triggered republican time to downvote me and provide no counter argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone that disagrees with me is hitlerracistsexist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre acting like any of these people are gonna listen to what you just said even if you strapped them to a chair and whispered it into their ears
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think they are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a joke dawg chill out give the salt back to michelle
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i assume everyone who goes out and protests a free election isnt smart enough to hold a job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nothing screams purposeful protest like protesting the nigga before he has even done anything shiet lets wait like after he takes office and inevitably fucks something up before we start yelling at the guy he already said he might not repeal obamacare maybe he was just acting like bigot during the election because he knew that was the only way to get the isolated realitytvwatching diet liter sodaaday drinking mammoths to vote for him let him fuck up first
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,george soros bus
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is how stupid liberals are lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when youre unemployed it doesnt really matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,libtards logic pick one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fact that you were downvoted is a testament to the intelligence of this sub lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i always saw protesting as just that if i was someone they were protesting at id just ignore it on tv change the channel in front my house bring out the shotty people yelling and screaming would make me completely dismiss anything anyone says people could be screaming at me that the sky was blue and id be like nah
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i disagree to do nothing would just show complacency and help normalize all the outrageous shit hes said and promised during his campaign im glad we protested early on though i expect and hope it mostly dies down until inauguration day theres already a large planned protest for his inauguration i dont think folks should clear the streets completely for example id support a longterm sitting protest across trump tower until inauguration day after that we should just be monitoring protesting as necessary i suppose but im not ready to adopt a wait and see attitude quite yet to be clear i dont support the protests that have morphed into legitimate riots and i sincerely hope those can be dialed back down to peaceful protests
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if only these people vote as much as they protest we wont be in this situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the people protesting arent the smartest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this post and comment section is top tier
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol libcucks btfo mad libtears kek
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,funny i didnt see ppl protesting and demonstrating outside the whitehouse chanting obscenities when obama was elected twice i didnt vote for the guy but protesting against the system that defines us as americans is completely unamerican if democrats are so angry they should be protesting against the dnc they really fucked you guys when they went against the populous vote and pushed sanders out the only candidate worth voting for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bernie voters typically have this kind of time on their hands just gotta get out of their moms basement is all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh man that sub is lit af
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,harsh man i really dont see whats so idiotic about it democrats really didnt show up to vote this year compared to previous elections
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ultimate waste of time these people have pokémon go withdrawals
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id imagine its kind of like hearing the opposite team get heckled after they rammed you up the ass somewhat satisfying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it never made sense to me what are they protesting democracy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know your country is almost halfretarded when people actually voted for hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly do they expect trump to step down or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,help im being oppressed on a meme board
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what are they protesting he won the election save this for when he actually does something worth protesting over this isnt how the grinch stole christmas trump isnt gonna hear chanting outside his window and have a change of heart
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont understand why youre getting downvoted oh wait forgot this was
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good to see someone with sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in order to understand you must look within the salt taste the salt become the salt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well theyre as smart as the black lifes matter protestors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please let today be a normal protest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its totally spontaneous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think it should be used as a dismisser either and of course there are unjustified police shootings of black people and cops get away with it due to a corrupt system and that absolutely needs to be fixed but the same thing happens to white people and some cops do make mistakes when it is your job to police a gang infested area of chicago you might have a hair trigger too since there are concentrated areas of extremely high crime involving predominately black people it kind of makes sense that more black people are going to get shot by cops the whole idea here is that while there are a few unjustified shootings some people believe black lives matter shouldnt be focusing all of their attention and energy on that when black people are killing each other in record numbers and innocent black bystanders are getting hit as well it is destroying the black community the war on drugs is too though and cops probably do more black people than white people for that so there is a case for blm to make there the issue is that blm shouldnt be protesting cops they should be protesting drug policies and laws that is when it makes sense to protest when you have a clear goal a clear piece of legislation you want to change you unfortunantly can not protest racism out of bigots which seems to to be blms goal but in the process some members seem to want to demonize all white people too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as pissed as i am about that moron being electedbpt has been fucking fire since last wednesday loving this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they voted for hillary they arent the brightest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,straight white male who voted trump and i love that title

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump won get over it you fucking libtards
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,biden literally wrote the bill passed by bill clinton that put your dads you never met in jail but what do i know ill admit to being a white male ban me for truth

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being racist to suggest racism love double standards
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that because we are winners and this is how we will keep winning hard work and dedication
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well being salty about it really doesnt help
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah im pretty sure you are mistakening us for cuck the record the shillary bit army if you wouldve watched the rallies you would know that we exist true to human form
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah bro its coo trumps tha homie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that would require too much reasoning if they were at that level theyd have realized clinton is not someone worth protesting for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes and the two edits complaining about it will only make it worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the worst part is someone will look at your statistics and say see more democrats are scared of republicans than vice versa so that clearly means republicans are evil and scare and racist reeeeeeeeeeeeee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh shit waddup
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what an arrogant thing to say just turns more people off from your cause truthfully
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how we expected to believe black lives matter when black on black crimes happen i dont hate blacks i just hate the black culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,let me get the salt after your done with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes but theyre all fucking retards hence why theyre protesting a trump victory
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see your problem is you assumed these children are intelligent while the rest of americas adults went back to work the children without a job the ones who want you to pay for their art degree are protesting a democratic election love it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems about white

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sorry but what does stunting on someone mean are you looking good with whatever you are buying or are you like tricking them into buying something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some guy in here commented asking what stunting was but deleted his comment before i could think of a witty comment to go with the stunt video
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white person here what does stunt mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,girl cutting my hair hmmm are you white just wondering
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol what like i give a fuck what jennifer lawrence thinks you take nude pics and send them across the airwaves youre risking them getting intercepted its the risk you take
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except those things are completely unalike raping an unconscious girl and looking at leaked nudes are completely different one directly affects someone whereas jlaw has no idea if i personally saw her pics once theyre leaked she will feel equally bad whether people see them or because all she knows is that x number of people are looking at them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can somebody explain what stunting means urban dictionary was no help since i doubt this is in reference to performing stunts in an athletic sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have a serious question is everyone here actually black or is everyone a bunch of white people pretending
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,let the games begin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i still dont know what stunting means

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao am i the only one that finds it funny that bpt is calling people out for not being black 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont youre joining a corrupt organization that basically can treat you like a slave and doesnt care for you all they care about is increasing their budget stolen out of hardworking americans pockets theyre not heroes the dudes working hours a week to provide our country with actual goods and services are heroes if you want to be a hero get a job and become a volunteer firefighter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aww its funny cause abuse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,na ill preface by saying im a trump supporter it astounds me this sub paints trump as racist when hillary is the one who described blacks as superpredators without conscience or empathy that need to be brought to heel but okay trump is racist because he wants to deport illegals and wants more controlled checks on muslim immigration
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pisspoor argument that always comes from the uninformed re your first point successful businessmen have failed ventures all the time this is like saying michael jordan lost games so isnt a good basketball player re comment on liquidity evidently you know nothing about debt financing so ill leave that one day he is not highly leveraged relative to the industry in most of his businesses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont care about politics but youre saying this on a subreddit full of white people pretending to be black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,any us born citizen years old or older can run for president you fucking idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im impressed a mglln post that isnt just race baiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes theyre on every single sub reddit sadly man not to mention its pretty hard because theres straight up delusional people who dont understand the issues hillary fans and ctr who are all combative incorrect and argumentative the most interesting thing ive witnessed is how people can hold issues and opinions so significantly with so much conviction and yet never look to have their ideas challenged or do any extensive research i thought people who cared about things attempted to be as informed as possible on them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have to critically analyze my own political stance because other side is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gross corruption is their mantra sheesh when are they going to look past that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ctr shill detected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah plus hillary clinton says she likes hot sauce which is what all you black people like right come on black vote shes pandering to you so perfectly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol a nigger with a degree in afro american studies wont get you anywhere same goes for all you liberal studies cucks too cry for the government to hand out more to you fools
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,top left young ma top right dej loaf bottom left young thug aka jeffery bottom right kevin gates
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,remember that time that trump said black people were super predators that need to be brought to heel oh waitthat was hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a black trump supporter httpiimgurcomynknhgnpng
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,today i learnt you type like an idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maga brother maga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because there are no famous african americans who are leaders of communities who are for trump right its not that trumps of the african american votes are on the rise or anything its not that the democrats have pandered to the black vote and then laughed behind their backs and done nothing for them for decades and people call thedonald an echo chamber this is hilarious i love it a lot of people are in for a brexitstyle surprise soon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,willful ignorance calling me a crazy conspiracy theorist is a copout as you have no valid arguments of your own to subdue what i wrote above seek out the facts my friend theyre all over the place now none of these things are theory anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what youre saying is that blacks beat their kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you would think all the white people in here would know to google lyrics before posting smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right but in the end he wasnt found guilty but i guess you dont remember that either do you remember the time when the clintons paid for a membership at an all white country club or how about when so now who do you vote for a guy that may or may not have refused to rent an apartment to a black person or someone with deep ties to the kkk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no more going gorillas guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stupid sexy flanders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stupid sexy flanders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its disingenuous to ignore one persons warts and not the others you should put them on a scale and see whos transgressions matter more or less for many people what hillary has done is worse than what trump has done
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah just support someone who refuses to defend your community after someone slaughters people in a gay club for simply being gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are aware that you are free to be married right and you could get married in a number of states before ogberfell v hodges right you have heard of the amendment right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,until trumps scotus picks revisit the decision and effectively overturn it nice try heterosplainer because thats super common even with a conservative court they have yet to rehear roe v wade lemme just uproot my whole life to move to a state where i have no connections just so that i can have the right to marry who i want makes sense yeah if its that fucking important to you people move to colorado for weed all the time what the amendment is talking about its not ambiguous like at all it is literally one fucking sentence you can suck the chrome off a trailer hitch but one sentence is clearly too complicated for ya the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,which everyone knows is what you do when youre guilty but dont want to legally admit guilt nope everyone doesnt know that because thats not what it means just like everyone knows that carrying a loss forward against taxable income is a basic tenet of every net income tax ever imposed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking heterosplainer fuck off fucking faggot fuck off youre like less than of the population loud ass fucking minority damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hiv wasnt invented you fucking retard its a disease
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,now she was against it until when it became politically expedient facts dont matter to you though neither does blind what about when she labeled black people as this woman is no friend of gay people black people or gay black people keep that head buried in the sand though or some dudes asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lie a lie and a gross exaggeration lmfao those were from the lefts own politifact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck that ho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,joe how about we grab melania by the pussy barack now youre talking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is so fucking dumb watch me get banned because of these dumb racist ass mods blacks on this sub always acting like some damn victims all white people are racist dae white people xdd as a black person you guys are disgusting and i hope you guys realize how ignorant you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump did not win purely because white people voted for him he got more black and more latino votes than romney hillary got less of all those groups compared to obama hillar got less women if all these white people are so racist why did they vote in a black man twice and then suddenly switch to a racist once confronted with a white woman because you are obsessed with identity politics and you cannot see past labels that is the problem of the new left it ignores class issues and just says white peopletrump the media framed the entire thing as a racegendergay campaign when bernie and trump and so many others told you it was about class this time that people didnt want her it is how all the polls were wrong and how you will never actually understand middle america or many other places in the world for that matter but instead of admitting people didnt want an insider and certainly not one as corrupt as her and learning from the mistake the new left is now yelling the are even more racist and evil than we thought the sexism is even worse see we lost but we are still right hillary the media and the dncs hubris did this to themselves dont fall for it too if you would like to respond please explain how trump got more blackhispanic of votes than romney and why hillary got less blackhispanicwomenyoung people of votes than obama if you cannot do this there is something else other than identity politics that determined the outcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,saying all white people are racist is like saying all black people are criminal make no sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess not but i definitely wasnt being serious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,getting beaten up and having your car stolen feels pretty bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,salty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah you should just let them get beat up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if i was racist id hate my black nieces newsflash i dont
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anti trump posts fuck white people posts fuck police posts instant upvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these days bpt is just one doot doot away from meirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and i would say the same about many black people who are not immune from the virus of racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,isnt this subreddit supposed to be comedic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he is probably thinking to himself man it has that black people stank im going to have to vacuum and wipe the whole place clean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right if the election was decided by anything related to identity politics or race or gender people have to first explain how compared to obama hillary got a lesser share of african american less hispanic and less women voters she got a lesser share of women voters than obama did think about that trump gained over romney in african americans and hispanics how can anyone who approaches the results like this explain that instead of admitting she was a terrible candidate and learning from their mistakes her supporters are just going oh my god everything is even worse than we thought its more sexist and racist than we ever believed it was no one likes racist people but its not like they stayed home the last elections and just voted now the same people who voted obama in twice and have made him the most popular outgoing president in history just voted in trump she was just shit and everyone told them she was shit and that this was the year of an outsider the republicans just got lucky they had their populist candidate forced on them while the dems cheated theirs because it was her turn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i got a question for the black folks though as a white female hillary supporter did yall not feel a little patronized by hillary saying she kept hot sauce in her purse or dabbing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump won by winning the rust belt voters who obama won twice so the people who voted for a black guy twice are suddenly racist when they refuse to vote for a white woman trump also won a higher percentage of the black and hispanic vote than romney did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a fuckin retard kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id say your obsession with color is a bit odd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you point to a single racist comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah all these politcal posts are pretty much on the same level of how annoying they are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can only speak from my limited experience but as a former bernie supporter i dont give a fuck who anyone voted for in the presidential election i just thought that shit was funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can agree white people have not been systematically oppressed in the past nor are they now however more black people are being polarized toward racism than ever before which is concerning for example the nation of islam notorious black supremacist group has an estimated of members while the klu klux klan has only members httpsenmwikipediaorgwikinationofislam httpsenmwikipediaorgwikikukluxklan i see a growing hatred of white americans and a fading hatred of black americans i hope that we can end politically motivated hatred including racism which includes pointing out tragic evidence such as the video i originally linked to which is much more concerning than the original post that we commented on this may have been the wrong sub for that but i feel it needs to be discussed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,check this video out explains why trump won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but you have seen a video of young black people beating an older white man for simply casting a vote while others cheer them on also black lives matter has chanted kill white people we want dead pigs etc for example httpsyoutubecomwatchvsuloscsvfza
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao most of the inventions we use were invented by white folks trump still a bitch tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they were screaming he voted trump the entire video it is pretty obviously the motivation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only tweets with actual proof arent physical assaults and the rest have no actual proof find me one video from this decadeof black people being assaulted for voting a certain way or just being black and then you will have an arguement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude theyve been here for as long as ive been lurking on this sub so many thefeelsfort fanatics love coming to bpt try to talk ebonics and be hip and mins later theyll be posting about how blm are terrorists and the only thing black culture has to offer is thug culture whilst literally at the same time saying fam and having the odd post in rhiphopheads the cognitive dissonance is unfuckingreal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if only people knew that the number of prisoners in private prisons is a small fraction of the total us prison pop oh well u dont come to bpt for facts u come for the memes and stay for the ignorant comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,comes in after a so called black man and performs better than a mexican taking a white mans job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god im so glad hes your president suck a dick bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i also sang this when i saw the picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre right but spreading opinions is counter intuitive if they arent educated or just wrong in general
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone says something racist about a minority they cry racist just the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes been dabbing since her days at yale too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets identify an entire race and make a statement about them while ignoring any obvious hypocrisy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you stupid fucks will submit to the next president of the united states have some respect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,george soros
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because why not profit the private prisons contains around of the us prison population they arent exactly putting pot dealers in them anymore honestly if youre in max security for a long stint you fucked up severely and you dont really deserve any accommodations other than reasonable ones as long as youre being kept alive in decent health and you have the opportunity to work thats all about you deserve tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fake hate crimes are up too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you suck this sub is pure shit always
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i realize the gravity of the two situations are quite different but this is the same logic people use when saying its okay that cops kill black people at a higher rate than white people because theyre all thugs and gangbangers who kill each other it is a statistical fact that a higher percentage of black men are involved in gang activity than white men but this does not make it okay for me to say something like black men are dangerous youre demonizing a whole race because of the actions of a few its wrong to do from either side i guarantee you most white people have not spent eight years posting racist memes just like most black people have never killed another black person it is easy to hate and it is easy to generalize but what people who do so are doing is called being racist a small handful of mostlikely white folks made some racist memes but now who you are referring to as these fucks are not those few but all white people herein lies the key component of prejudice and racism and a huge reason racism has managed to stick around for so long i say this as someone who fucking hates the fact that we have to deal with a trump presidency for the next four years but also as someone who would rather understand where the problem comes from than further divide our country there are going to be antiwhite racist memes and there are going to be antiblack racist memes there will be antimuslim antiasian antihispanic memes some people think they are funny and others find them offensive i think another reason white people are getting especially offended by the antiwhite memes are because while most racist jokes follow the formula people of race x are different in y way which is funnyweirdstupid which can feel shitty and dehumanizing but the antiwhite memes of late send the message white people are our enemies which im sure is a scary feeling if you are white hardly anyone was complaining about the school shooter or incest memes i think its just an issue of feeling like everyone wants to start a race war against you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah yes the ignorant black community clinging to the table scraps of the democrats instead of getting behind someone who might actually improve their lives i challenge anyone to give an example of trumps racism against blacks while reminding you of hillarys comments about bringing you superpredators to heel wake up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that god we will finally be rid of this obamanation day begin construction of wall day repeal obamacare day renegotiate nafta day revoke passports and begin investigations of obama and hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stereotype me all you want at least im still white at the end of the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my huband wewy good man he make us good tank u
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a nihilist living in a reality tv show was one of the reasons i voted trump its just so funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,smart business practice smart business practice true statement hearsay probably true affirmative action is there to benefit blacks is that a secret im not seeing an issue here i was implying the ignorant portion of the black community not the community as a whole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we have million people waiting to talk shit to us dont need fellow blacks doing the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your comment is why i voted for trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah okay you go try ot at years old youre full of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know what heres an idea maybe we admit that people of different cultures cant get along and coexist and well partition off areas that we can live in without having to deal with each other how does that sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tbqh this election made me a lot more sympathetic towards the brexit cause
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ha the butthurt in this entire sub has been great the past few days keep it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its my least favorite part of this sub content is second to title game every single top comment is about the fucking title
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,literally the kind of phrase that got him elected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol so this sub is pretending you werent comparing hillary to tupac thankfully we can pretend both are dead now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the morning after the election i white guy who lives in philly didnt vote was in an elevator with three black people i really had to resist the urge to say how about that trump doubt it wouldve gone well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because they actually thought that the badly dressed media and strap on dookie diaper pants wearing celebrities words have actual value 😐
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,way to spread racial unity guys anyone postingupvoting these threads while complaining about trump being so divisive is a true fucking idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes actually probably just a racist not a nihilist at least judging by the
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,husband u know damn wel thats ya baby daddy hoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they killed themselves because of election results enough though trump has said he support lgbt sounds more like those people had some kind of mental illness probably why they put on a dress and think theyre an oppressed minority because nobody thinks they are pretty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive never submitted to this sub and i never will it used to be funny shit now its just black roleplay in the comments section
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your point why cant i try to make something better from the inside
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i honestly dont understand what point youre trying to make are you saying that he has a lot of great policies and plans and im only focusing on the negative shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitest username ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ya man pence is literally going to use his vp power to get his gustapo to start rounding up the gays any day now everyone should run and hide and cause chaos in fear trump is going to be right behind him rounding up mexicans and sending them back to mexico and rounding up muslims and sending them back to islam any day now america will be great again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats pretty convenient for your argument and if we pretend that its true youre still making the assumption that you know the motivation for my actions which you dont
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i anticipated that a comment made for the sake of humor may be poorly received because im aware of racial issues in regards to the recent election racial doesnt mean racist i didnt frame things that way at all thats how you perceived it thats in your head these were three working professionals im talking about youre the person who brought assault into the equation what really bothers me is that after a few sentences you think you can label me as someone so inhuman that i cant judge individuals based on the content of their character you need me to be racist because it helps reinforce your poor me mindset fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a coward
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you have to be really white racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like all the policies that obama and bush ii were totally gonna do remember how bush ii was super duper gonna sign the defense of marriage act he got reelected and then he didnt give a fuck about all the homophobes who wanted it he already got their votes remember his dad saying no new taxes remember how there were new taxes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,member how bush ii was totally gonna sign the defense of marriage act and ruin everything for gay people once he got the homophobes votes he doublecrossed them and didnt sign shit remember how his dad said no new taxes remember how there were new taxes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the terrible things he promised member how bush ii promised to do a very very terrible thing that trump wouldnt even dream of member the defense of marriage act once bush got his term he didnt give a fuck about the homophobes member his dad saying no new taxes remember how there were new taxes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall realize that the only reason yall think hes hitler is because the media told you he was so they could get hillary elected right i mean that trump yall are scared of is straight fictional dude aint real
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no wonder blck people are so fucked up if their dad doesnt abandon them they just fucking ignore their children

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most of my friends are girls and im a straight dude my exgirlfriends have never been vocal with an issue over it though i do sometimes leave out details like if they stay over i live in my citys centre and taxis be more expensive than a bus theyll stay in the same bed etc because its just easier that way idk i just get on easier with girls than guys i hate the whole lad culture and ive been upfront about this in the early stages of any relationship guess its like you know what youre getting into early biggest problem is their jealous boyfriends normally i just befriend them and if theyre a gym fiend then my skinny ass aint a perceived threat getting them to stop hanging out with a girl after i break up with them friends leaving stuff at my flat and girlfriends thinking its been left by a girl i am fucking with though that only happens once or twice before they get used it i find girls to be much better wingbuddies and much better at advice dating clothes financial cologne than guys though no doubt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut up bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this a scene from the new planet of the apes movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao you just triple downed unbelievable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and pawgs gotta love those
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mad phaggot

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitest dude in this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair i dont think hillary has touched many minorities in her life at least not without wiping her hands after
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its how rblackpeopletwitter looks like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is him his twitter is httpstwittercomsailornigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so white kyle but your friends call you black because you listen to hippity hop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre serious there is a real problem when it comes to hiring and promoting minorities in corporations it doesnt indicate a lack of intelligence on the part of minority people the same goes for hollywood if films starring minorities arent produced how can you assume the talent isnt there and even when films starring minority actors are made they tend to be underpromoted and underrepresented george star wars lucas had to fight for years to get his film about tuskegee airmen made and even then it didnt get nearly the same promotion as other films made by someone like him would get stop making lazy comparisons because they dont serve any point if it turns out that white people were not allowed to take part in the qualifier races then there is a problem if white people are systemically kept from participating in track at all there is a big problem unless you are claiming that is what happened dont make the comparison
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in those situations you dont have to be the best at what you do it definitely helps but they can choose who they want
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,score better on your tests then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not to be that guy and youre probably kidding idk and its great for them but i mean doesnt it sound kind racist if you put whiteexcellence somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know this is just gonna get way more people to do it right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes right though ¯ツ¯
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this school has too many white people lets diversify it by giving scholarships to others for the color of their skin instead of working harder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how bout them oscars act better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont recall asians being shipped to the americas to work on slave plantations
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats why its an analogy it means you take the same principles and try to apply them to different situation but ill try to do a better job at explaining it to you since you had difficulty figuring out the diet comparison how about implementing redlining so that black people will never have the opportunity to move into better neighborhoods and will be confined to crimeridden ghetto neighborhoods having the police disproportionately target and jail minority men in these areas under drug charges even though white people sell and use drugs at a similar or higher rate how about after releasing these men from jail you take away their voting rights so that they will have absolutely no political say on their circumstances in this country also give them a permanent criminal record so that they wont be able to get a job and will have to uhhhh sell drugs to provide for their families ensuring that the public schools in these ghetto areas are underfunded to shit so that no students will be prepared to go to higher education nor will they even see it as a possibility in their life time i could go on about the impact of single parent households and food deserts but i really dont think ill change anyones mind here in fact i just realized i wasted my time even typing all this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,listen to yourself were talking about business here the corporate world is the epitome of facts data and statistics if you are qualified and smarter than the other guy thats it money is the bottom line not gender not race not sexual orientation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,downvoted for speaking the truth smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hmm first slave arrived in jamestown in and the emancipation proclamation was in im no einstein but i think your math might be a little off there whiz kid i suppose you think its racist that youre not a ceo as well you poor oppressed mathematician
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and where do these whacky stereotypes come from do the big bad white guys sit in an office board room and come up with them and distribute them to the white sheep do you think asians dont have negative stereotypes because they have worked incredibly hard and have a culture that admires hard work and education negative media stereotypes please every single part of the media is terrified to portray black people in negative light now a days in fear of being labelled racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not getting into university study harder then women not getting into stem study harder then getting shot more by the police commit less crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow some badhistory right here they were not shipped they immigrated to the us willingly and the slavelike conditions they worked in were still better than slavery conditions and there were no laws prohibiting them from gaining an education or political power like there were for black people think jim crow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people complain about everything you want to change the social construct let their be more black judges and lawyers value education and score better on tests no one gives a shit if you can run fast
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think those cases are different because those are roles where people are chosen by other people while running is literally all on you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you forgot a period at the end of your sentence maybe you should be learning some grammar dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,funny thing about hollywood shitty black actors mad they didnt get an oscar is a perfect comparison to this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know whats really weird that black culture is more about single mothers low gpas and drug use and if you want to talk about your roots go put a plate in your lip cause thats not weird by anyones standards
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right perfect blame racial tension on black people like if only the blacks them all their problems would be solved how about you instead address years of not having access to education on account of white people bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more complicated by more complicated you mean negate the agency of the individual kids who dont perform well and just blame white people gotcha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot more goes into an education than just the studentfamily caring about their education
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the irony of this post is just too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ye b just like how the white people got into college what can i say study harder oh wait they sending black people in place of other people with higher scores cos they black oh shit nigga this logical consistency it too much for my peanut brain
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,things are gettin a lil jim crowy here we might have to lock this down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,every time some one disagrees with a black man hes racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,o wow yeah ok i might have taken some of that in the wrong context lol my point still stands tho i hate when people trivialize centuries of oppression and socioeconomic trampling into lol just get better grades like the educational system isnt also rife with racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but if we use this same logic for people with hard science degrees is racist and sexist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres a serious lack of diversity in hollywood act better then ¯ツ¯
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,asian families have been in america for less time on average than the average black family and have traditionally lived in urban areas as well httpwwwasiannationorgmodelminorityshtml asians who are nonimmigrant perform worse then black americans black immigrants who are non refugees have the highest rates of education and overall money but they are rolled in with black americans the majority of asian americans are immigrants whove arrived here in less then years and had college education or excessive amounts of money from oversees making their numbers higher then they should where do you think the millionaires and billionaires of china send their kids for school the west rich people immigrate here from china and have been doing so as their country becomes richer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn you rekt them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this man is preaching here if a white person posted school statistics and said black people should get smarter then they would be sooooooo upset i love it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet you defend affirmative action and diversity quotas in companies hows those mental gymnastics going for ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,guys its a joke the person is trying to spin how all these sjws are constantly crying discrimination in every facet of life because white people hold a higher percentage of those sought after jobs and the like the point they are making is obvious every black woman is there because they are the best of the best now whether right or wrong that would be the claim of the original tweet as to why whites have better jobs and education levels
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bias can play a major part in deciding who is smarter not to mention it rarely is about who is smarter but who they think is a better fit in the other situation a stopwatch chooses the stopwatch holds no bias towards anyone it starts it stops it spits the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we are not equal and never will be black people are faster at running white people are faster at swimming that shit is not going to change people are different just deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just stop selling drugs just stop comminting crimes just stop resisting the officer just stop being poor work harder just pay attention in school just stay woke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,could say the same about prisons and the projects
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,competitive swimming is dominated by white people but it would be incredibly distasteful for someone to respond with swim faster then quite the opposite happens we get lots of articles i agree with you fundamentally you gotta earn your way there but that applies to swimming as much as it does to running so why is it ok to have this attitude about blackdominated sports but not white ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a liiiiiittle different fwiw white dude here youre talking the difference between places where people are subjectively selected and where theyre objectively ranked theres no ironclad set of criteria that you can just numerically apply to those when people are nominated for the oscars its just a group of people picking their favorites ceos are nominated by previous executives for sports i mean you can either do the thing or you cant now your complaint is accurate when it comes to demographics in universities btw colleges dgaf about color and gender when it comes to enrolling students theyll just snag the tuition and be happy with it if not enough diversity is happening in say computer science degrees or whatever its because not enough people are going for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in jerry sandusky wouldnt it be the other way around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so when people complain about lack of diversity at colleges maybe black people should study harder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i find it funny that the top of this thread says its not like they were handpicked then you went ahead and made comparisons in which both cases are people handpicked to be in a position completely missed the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol this applies to black people toobe smarter then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not the same imo unless you got a disability you gotta chance to run not everbody has great shot at becoming a ceo or going to acting schools
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are studies showing that people with black sounding names are not called into interviews as much as people with white sounding names identical credentials of course
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats not a very affirmative thing to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe there would have been more black actors at the oscsrs if they had been better actors but thats none of my business because stfu whitey butthurt mods delete this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a little
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the point is that doesnt sound weird at all for you to say however if i say im a proud white american ill get a buzzfeed article written about me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and they took the hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what do you expect they start the race with a gunshot white people dont stand a chance we just want stand around and investigate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just like in college and the universoh wait affirmative action yeah i guess you have to earn your place only if youre not a black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just like in college and the universoh wait affirmative action yeah i guess you have to earn your place only if youre not a black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not truefootball will always need qbs coaches and owners
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea like were the ones complaining about blacks all the time right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cletus jethro buford beau delroy floyd lloyd boyd probably aint getting same number of call backs as tim and john
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,genetically fast and genetically ugly as sin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how can you judge someone as having a ghetto name if you judge them by their name how exactly are they supposed to ever get out of the damn ghetto in the first place imagine were talking about a legitimate ghetto here the historical european jewish slum kind and someone is being passed over due to their name sounding pretty jewish how is this any different separately from the massive problem that is judging by name like that and assumed ethnicity the names do not need to be what you call ghetto to be passed over even asian names despite asians being the most highlyeducated racial group have been proven in countless experiments and research to be passed over in education and hiring applications when compared to the equal profile but white christian sounding name its not too difficult to see its a problem yet a lot of white people seem blind to it not claiming its some jim crowlevel discrimination but its not a good thing at least other societies seem to actually acknowledge their inbuilt racism my asian relatives halfway across the globe for instance warned me that if things were equal whites prefer their own kind and they also pretty much admit to the same thing what im getting at here basically being that the problem needs to be acknowledged if people are to stop subconsciously or not profiling people or having preference to people due to race and it seems weve come to a point where its become standard to claim there is no problem whatsoever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you saying biases in the western world dont exist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so a meritocracy is fine here but not in other places
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you just proved the point for people who are against affirmative action if you get it it should be because you earned it nothing else no more welfare no more handouts stand on your own feet make your own pride and way forward that was once the american spirit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not trolling when its true and its not racist to point out facts nothing is owed or guaranteed in a human lifetime you have to make do with what you have and give your children something better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah how dense youre so sensitive to point out double standards jeeze can somebody just kill white people please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the thing is though no one has the exact same performance that never happens that being said there is still a marginal difference there that shows one person is the better candidate even if just slightly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,disagree with something call them racist black power
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were waiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol this thread shows how many whites people are on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,does it mention race because that was what this post was about in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rofl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,analogies are racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,competitive swimming is dominated by white people and people cry about diversity with it one guy makes a joke aboutrunning not being diverse enough and the black person resorts to the whole boot strap thing that would typically be used on them are you trying to imply that white people are better at swimming because they have better access it the worlds surface is water but a membership at a rec center isnt that expensive either that would also mean you are implying that all nonwhite people are impoverished inner city people who cant swim i am not sure what you are doing you dont seem to be able to explain yourself and are resorting to dumb insults and trolling stop pretending you arent a dumbass dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,figured you wouldnt have an intelligent response garbage trolling son
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you advocating discrimination against white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sooo you agree you should stop making dumb arguments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do people not realized the original post was a joke pointing out how silly it is to pick any assembly of people and call them out for lack of diversity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no really asian students with better scores and grades get denied while black students with lower scores and grades get accepted fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,work harder then study harder then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you went through alot of mental gymnastics to make this work if you are born with some kind of leg defect then yes you mostly likely wont be running track and field in the olympics but there isnt a racial inferiority or superiority for athleticism if you train hard you have just as much an equal chance to make it to the olympics or whatever as your opponents same with academia if you studied really hard and come up with some revolutionary work you have just as much chance to work for nasa or when the novel prize even if you went to a impoverished school like the detroit public school system if you really really tried you could make it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because they didnt work to get out of it i personally come from a irish background the irish where hugely discriminated cheap labor on the east you know how my family got out of poverty they worked whether it be physical labor or good financial decisions they made enough so their next generation would be able to start on the right foot african americans are able to be rich like any white man but if they expect everything to be handed to them and only yell in the streets they will stay poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,¯ツ¯
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,muh affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,amount of asses in seats asses more movies you get to act in
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i did not say you did i was just askingyou said white people had never being systematically discriminated against and that needed to be remedied i am sure you can see how your statement could be taken that way also in some cases undoing discrimination is discrimination i did not say that i do not believe in systematic discrimination nor did i even remotely suggest that i hold that opinion i was merely seeking clarification on your comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres like different tests with the sole purpose of quantifying someones intelligence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not a proper comparison a argument so many valid points
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can feel your impotent butthurt from here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gtfo are black people getting harder sats
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sad little brown man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this wouldnt be a problem if the whites didnt put black people in the shitty place theyre in they cant help the fact their ancestors were taken advantage of god i wish we could kill all white people the world would be a more colorful place
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and a lot of you wonder why your black friends dont like you smh

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,leave it to black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no hes just a liberal living in his fantasy world this sub used to be funny now its a libcuck retard antitrump circle jerk i think ill get my political commentary from somewhere besides tweets from welfare recipients
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha i feel you dawgs i dont have any work ethic because my dad wasnt in my life either better follow his footsteps and make a lot of illegitimate children with random women that can use their high birth rate to ask for more free money from uncle sam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because no black kids drop out of school for worse reasons but sure lets keep making race comparisons and then get angry about the responses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,women love to act as if we care about the glitter we care about your fake contoured nose and cheeks that make you look like you won the genetic lottery when you actually didnt

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmfao you sound like some racist ass white dude ew theyre eating chinese i bet its octopus penises like it was literally lamb pork tofu with peppers and spices i know those crazy orientals eat just like the rest of us beside that how do you know what youre eating is all you like what if you like something even more than what you like now it builds character it exposes you to new cultures and ideas it expands your own creativity in your own kitchen which not only is fulfilling but gets you ass a lot too cause girls love that shit no one is telling you to eat shit its just sad youre so afraid of trying new things even something as trivial as a cultures different way of cooking the exact same shit you eat now like even the chinese got their own fried dishes la zi chicken for instance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if slavery was that bad why didnt the slaves like fight to the death like the native american lakota people they actually made the us govt sign a treaty of surrender wah we were made to work natives were all but eradicated via biological warfare and forced starvation then fought the govt into surrender no sympathy for the slaves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this thread is toxic as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rallpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they dont see white men as human
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is acting like a total bitch taking shit personally on the internet usually this kind of thing gets downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can always take a sniper rifle and target a few of them at random
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,omg its cuz he blakkk he shot someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you hear a black man has been shot and you instantly assume it was due to black on black violence youd most likely be correct ya digg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes naturally violent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah he just cant run away
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those type of people wont change their mind no matter how much info you show them they just downvote and spout the same shit in rthedonald again and again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems he started vote manipulation at this sub too somehow different ops never crop his namepp from posts yeah this guy is true cancer of reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,majority okay not even going to comment on this one humour me and tell me what you thought my comment actually meant it probably doesnt mean what you seem to think it does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,poverty is too im with you up until youre all but denying that race plays any role whatsoever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you sound like you have the inferiority complex man sorry youll never make it to a white mans level in society because your stupid and lazy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people get into schools with lower credentials so what are you talking about is the reasoning behind the crime and welfare studies contributing it to the fact that black people just cant integrate into a functional society white privilege was made up by black people as a scape goat to explain why they cant succeed when really its just theyre lazy destructive and stupid most of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people are afraid of being killed for committing crimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks want all the attention and want everyone to feel bad for them implying they wont get special treatment scares them because theyre afraid to lose their welfare and affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe thats more proof they could be his children maybe the gene coding for melanin wasnt being produced in his sperm cells similar to how it was in his skin cells
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean like rblackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats an awesome place but ive never seen the pool in the front yard before
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtumblrinaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,post weak title weak you can do better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,terrible title but ill take her and the crib for goats and cows
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people commit more crimes statistically than other groups
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see i never really understood this so hopefully someone can respectfully help me figure it out when a cop kills someone be it black mostly but any color its like sad and shit but why dont we black folks just work together we demand respect from cops but we dont respect each other i dont get it i get shit from other black people for not being black enough and theyve even threatened me sometimes just because im just not like them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more than twice the number of white people are killed by the police and approximately the same amount of hispanics according to fbigov police dont shoot blacks they shoot criminals this is a media narrative not the reality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,time to give him some wellfare
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont expect an unbiased answer in this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,picking cotton and inventing peanut butter buildig america k
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are they shot at an alarming rate proportional though i believe percent of people killed by cops this year were black black people make up a little over percent of the population now this doesnt seem proportional at first glance but when seeing that black people are more likely to live in higher areas of poverty where crime is more common that would seem to be a reason on why they have more run ins with the cops or am i way off im not sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get off that white mans lawn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no more than any regular population has deviations from the norm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a proportionally alarming rate yeah not even close black on black belittles this statistically embarrassingly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and afterwords the country was just a little bit safer and welfare went down by one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he could be one hit away his whole career
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mom boy you about to get it now you running around my house like its a damn zoo im about to kill your ass like that gorilla
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt ignorant white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you sound oppressed and upset here have a snickers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yep everyone there trying to defend the two recent murders too fucking disgusting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes cause doing something that is a part of your job discription is the same thing as mercilessly picking off cops with a fucking sniper way to go black community this is how you get heard and get things done slaughtering
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it isnt an alarming rate theyre shot half as often as whites at about of fatal police shootings they contribute to of crime despite representing somewhere around of the total us population both of these numbers have risen steadily during previous years they are responsible for of murder again reconciling that they only represent of the population of criminal events and of robbery under these and many other types of crimes are committed disproportionately to an even greater extent by blacks in america also to make a potentially bold claim research suggests blacks have a special gene called the warrior gene well whites and others have it too but significantly less often like by the hundreds or thousands of times blacks has it i actually dont know whether its being selected for over time heres some info on that you can make your own conclusions on how much you think that affects crime rates theres a reason that blacks are profiled they commit more crime by the numbers than other ethnic groups in america unless you make the supposition that whites asians and hispanics are all just ignored by police which is absurd theres nothing racist about this i understand that the common argument against this is that theres a magical barrier preventing blacks from being successful and safe because of a mystical systematic oppression yet many blacks find success i think this is more of a cultural dependency on gang culture and generally not valuing wise investment into the future i think were past blaming whites now and should probably start looking for solutions instead ie drop welfare so blacks can depend on themselves instead of continuing to be enslaved by govt resources there are problems with the justice system the way people have their lives destroyed by getting caught with drugs is insanity and just stupid the fact that police do often get away with what ends up being murder is disappointed the issue with that though is that it is very difficult to analyze a case of brutality fairly from a third perspective it might seem obvious but you have to hear the cop out first see what was going on up there still if you kill a man and you werent clearly in selfdefense dont belong on the streets anymore police officers are not evil they do an intensive job wherein they put their lives on the line to deal with the most repulsive and despicable parts of humanity daily they are not normal citizens they are trained to be high alert at all times and must make quick decisions where most people would be lost couple that with the constant pressure placed on them by media and growingly evidently the general populace i dont envy them they do a tough thankless job even for all of the people who protest against them they deserve more credit for their work and certainly do not deserve to be sourced as a scapegoat for the problem that is washington policy on black americans as always calling people racists etc is an easy answer to a highly complex problem sources httpswwwwashingtonpostcomgraphicsnationalpoliceshootings check their sources at the bottom for primary references
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my ancestors built this country no they didnt just throwing that out there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i believe that is why blacks are shot in this country i thought it was the disproportionate amount of crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this post is fucking retarded and you should regret being born for how poorly you understand world events
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol being reasonable makes an uncle tom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alton was such a standup guy not a peice of shit at all oh yeah best off dead good riddance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is minding your own business now code word for brandishing your firearm in front of a convenience store and having the cops called on you resisting arrest trying to draw your gun while under arrest trying to reach for an officers gun robbing a convenience store being a criminally convicted sex offender none of these people killed by the cops were innocent black men walking down the street unlike the cops this demographic killed in dallas they were walking down the street keeping the protestors that hate them safe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anybody else feel like this sub is turning to shit now with all these fuck the police posts i thought that shit was funny at first but now its beating a dead horse we need a newer spicier meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in most rap music crime is often a subject do black people not understand that they have made the association to criminals easy can someone explain this to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so i can technically sharpie a penis near washington mouth and still spend it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre right so now that weve established this can we address that blacks proportionally commit more violent crimes in comparison to whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the arrogance of this year old im restructuring it really chance you alone are ushering in a new eon of racial peace and prosperity these celebrity kids always way overstate their importance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people dont think cops are called on white people thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what is it called when a music style celebrates the benefits of crime and encourages people to become criminals nobody forces black people to celebrate the life of a criminal nobody forces antiintellectualism on a people if white people find it disturbing they are well within their rights to avoid black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit title as usual
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well that thread got me pretty angry fuck whites are the worst
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i dont understand why people say ones worse than the other we shouldnt be shooting people at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not really a good argument blm is an absolute piece of shit movement even setting aside their killings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you pig
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because we cant polarize the issue as much if we use logic and see that both sides have merit only one side can be right duh s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are a prime example of the reason why the issue is escalating and that nobody can talk about race in any meaningful way nobody said that anybody deserves to die i am criticizing black americans for letting violence and crime take a hold on their culture on this subreddit you see misspelling and references to crime culture everywhere posts that mock white people are fine and am echo chamber has been created in which the police who try to prevent murders and gun crime in the black community are seen as villains i cant comment on this as i dont know but in documentaries ive seen it appears as though black communities are encouraged to never cooperate with the police that they are the enforcement wing of white americans yet then they are told that dealing drugs and killing those that mock you are preferable to pursuing an engineering degree and yet the focus is continually put on white america to change i cannot see this being well received by the majority of people that want nothing more than peaceful cities and good schools for their children speaking of rock music i would agree with you if of the population suddenly became drug addicts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but who commits the most crimes on average 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but blacks commit statistically more crimes so its disproportionate according to the crimes and not the race theres more in it than just the number of people in the race is also the number of criminals in the race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pic albums are trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt fit the narrative of a good boy just selling cds that dindunuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah im saying stop making a trace issue and keep it a cop issue when it becomes a race issue you see that more whites are killed than blacks and blacks commit more crimes so if anything whites get killed too often
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,upvote for the dinner reference dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is a feature of black culture i am surprised you cannot accept this criticism yet feel free to mock the police force on twitter that organization is made up of all races yet you consider targeted racism a feature of their organization so is it just stupidity when you do it and racism when i do it i dont pay a dime to support black culture i train engineers regardless of their color and hope that they can use the tools i teach them to make better tools and improve the quality of life for all people i am an active agent in making the world a better place in the best way i know how and all cultures and skin colours are welcome and havent been turned away i would stop teaching someone in a heartbeat if they told me that they have to kill someone for disrespecting them or rob a person because they want nice things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,brown you mean the guy who robbed a liquor score
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well we should take a look at the chance of a black getting killed by cop to the chance of a white person getting killed by cop says that blacks have a times higher felony rate than whites do and have a times higher likelihood of getting by killed by cop seems like whites get killed more often per felony than blacks do huh whodathunk it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black guys arent around their babies long enough to get shot in front of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,conservative means the government has a conservative non invasive role you have no idea what youre talking about you have a black president and black attorney general and youre blaming who on the way laws are enforced there were mass shootings when gwb was in office there have been over since barrack hussein took office i can blame the establishment too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is alton tell me this is someone you want in your community tell me that you and this person want the same things and that he is on the right side of history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes its racist and its stupid but these white people live sheltered lives and every time they turn on their fox news or go on facebook theyre inundated with stories about white people being killed by black people and how obama is gonna start putting white people in work camps any day now plus black folks do commit a higher percentage of crime than whites which gives them a real basis for their paranoia yes if youre not white youre times more likely to be shot by the police but if youre not white youre times more likely to commit a violent crime souce us doj using those same doj stats if chicago were to consist solely of white people murder would drop by percent rape by percent and robbery by percent none of this is to suggest that nonwhites are innately more violent than whitesthe disparity in these statistics can be explained largely by socioeconomic differences and the institutional disadvantages keeping nonwhites trapped in these same socioeconomic levelsbut you have to admit that white people have more than a little reason to be paranoid but fixing that would mean acknowledging these inequalities and doing something about it so dont hold your breath
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol how many of those committed a crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,want the logic okay blame the blm movement because they feel they are perpetuating racial inequality as the number one issue facing our country and making blacks feel as if they are constantly discriminated against by whites leading to misguided anger and hatred when it is a blatantly false narrative blame obama the democratic party for perpetuating a welfare state that indirectly provides economic incentives for having out of wedlock children has seen single parenthood rise dramatically for whites from to and for blacks from to blame them for allying with teachers unions in inner cities opposing charter schools and voucher programs that would give low income children predominantly black access to an education that is not being provided by the corrupt and crumbling public school system againthese cities are all run by democrats blame black inner city democratic legislators who were actually the ones who pushed for and voted in legislation for sentencing disparities between crack cocaine and powder leading to a larger portion of blacks being arrested for drugs because they saw that drugs led to gang activity and crime blame them for offering no solutions to the problems facing the black community and putting black kids at great risk to get left behind or be sucked into street culture instead of getting an education and a high income and uplifting their households and communties if you dont want to be poor dont get pregnant at an early age graduate high school be raised in a parent household the biggest factors but conservatives are racist for wanting charter and voucher schools for curbing welfare for encouraging traditional marriage but facts are racist it is only how you feel that matters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its that muslim kid always we had tat guy in school smelt like shit but was cool af and smart as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,another one

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that face you make when were a few days into and black youth fucking up kidnapping people already
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,huh but they arent african names no one in africa is called lashawnda
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my class register had a kid called suk dik son or son suk dik wild times
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how is this bp oh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they knew what they were doing they know niggas dont swim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if ever there was proof this sub is just white people pretending to be black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pretty sure he didndu nuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i think chicago did that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but she started dating him years ago way before she was famous i think her standards have since gone up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this word is terrible and youre all terrible for spreading it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont like how every time black people have a meme they always say about how white people are mad at it idgaf about it its funny and i havent seen any white people that are upset by it or anything makes black people look insecure to always be going on about how whitey doesnt want them having fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get some brooklyn homies out there yall be deadass in the water
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,avoid saying the n word around black people we say the n word all the time when its just us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is just pathetic petty bullshit and a bunch of whites who wish they had a black friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont know its no army of white girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you have the time to watch a minute video this youtuber raises some excellent points i dont agree with everything he says but you can definitely argue that this tommy lahren person did rather well in the interview
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he probably has a real job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can see how hes not everyones cup of tea but his opinions on feminism and anything else controversial whatever they are dont invalidate the points he raised in this video and as far as im aware hes definitely not for white genocide
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and rational thinking is just a right wing racist ideal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait what since when has discussing genocide or pointing out the hypocrisy of selective offense over racial jokes ie joke sbout white genocide fine but joke about other genocide racist been a bad thing and do you think all feminists are good honest people by definition with no bad apples
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yepthats hour word black people we never ever use that word when youre not around not to make jokes or anything ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,niggernavy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why dont we all just say it a thousand times today and then agree that its just a word and has no real power
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sure most people here realize shes dumb as shit but youd have to be genuinely deaf and blind to not realize blm is a racist movement that could easily be considered a terrorist movement if anyone cared to really call it that its not really a vocal minority thing anymore when a movement very blatantly shifts from the disenfranchisement of a people to deliberately hating another person due to race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,try way too hard ie this whole sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you white liberals really trying to pass this off as our doing damn you some race traitors this was cnn all the way good thing yall congregate in the same places
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uss shaniqwa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but trump is shitting in obamas mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,u raysiss
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what did the first few words of my post read like to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont care what words someone i dont know tells me i can or cant use
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this will have to suffice for now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because based off what she says everyone assumes she is racist so we cant use a persons words to judge their character thats like not even assuming dont use that word its observing i guess we cant just assume trumps racist based on the things hes said then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why not why do we just absolutely have to be butthurt over a word a word which mind you basically means black were moving the same direction with brown certain people say it with such distaste that its becoming inappropriate to use it at all there are a lot of words i can say that would be intentionally hurtful to other people the word itself is not what is hurtful its the intent and sentiment behind it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a hispanic man its amazing how out of touch the blm community is with the rest of the usa for example these comments just seem like a giant contest by a bunch of to see who is the biggest victim this sub seriously bitches more than rtwoxchromosomes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well black people are disproportionately responsible for crime blacks commit about half the crime despite being only of the population so its perfectly valid to ask why blm would focus on cop killings and not on fixing their neighborhoods since most black men are killed by other black men and not by cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the answer to that question is niggas of course
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you got us bpt its almost not even worth being white my whole life bahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody wants you persian girls are fucking annoying and way too hotheaded i should know i grew up around them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,at some point we have to get over years of shit im ready now anyone who isnt ready now is just perpetuating the problem unnecessarily

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh you mean cause my account was banned for no reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my account got banned for having a different opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,apparently the mods in this subreddit will ban you if you dont agree with the hivemind but yes keep telling yourselves trump supporters are the fascists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cause its kinda hard to reply to comments when youre literally banned from commenting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im technically a and i thought trump was the lesser of two evils explain to me how much you think im uneducated white trash id love to hear it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well thats it true have you seen young trump complete stud
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also not white trash exmilitary etc doing well for my age the don was obviously the lesser of two evils would love an explanation on how im trashy as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you could give pbs of the us budget still isnt going make you monkeys actually care about world events

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck trump with razor wire
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im a white girl but i still get the sausage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she raped a student genders reversed people would be calling for the teachers balls on a platter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why dont you people discuss politics in a place thats not the most obvious echo chamber of all time literally any anti trump comment is upvoted heavily and every pro trump comment is downvoted to hell if you guys really want to make a difference you need to be able to listen to the other side as well instead of just stroking your egos
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how much do we spend on welfare on illegal immigrants a year aint it like billion or some shit forgot where i read that but like billion isnt that much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay i wont call it welfare but government benefits
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay work with me im trying to learn if they have a background check are they then citizens not trying to be a dick trying to learn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont know if yall watch the news or anything but hes getting mexico to pay for the wall by taxing all imports from mexico its not coming out of american pockets its just a back door way of getting them to pay for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats what i thought just clearing it up so do you believe was spent on government assistance to illegal immigrants last year is that true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good point and im sorry about your accident thats why i stay out the ocean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go live in another country if its so bad oh wait you wont

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets be real this sub is not a majority of black americans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol just because i dont mind trump means im a racist try harder haha you sound a little offended
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey now being judgemental doesnt fix anything two wrongs dont make a right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,til brown people can be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not even worth arguing for trump on this sub if you really wanna have a discussion pm me or lets talk in a different sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sanctuary cities wont deport illegals can even get drivers licenses in california illegals dont only work cash in hand a lot of times they use a made up or stolen ssn which makes filing your taxes extra fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont subscribe to either of those subs never even been on either of them tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthe donald and raltright are nothing of the same raltright is trash and the white supremacist nationalist wasnt the actual point of the original altright the media and actual racist took it over if you actually took the time to read the comments on rthedonald after the purge of the altrighters you would see actual unity yes you cant say anything negative about trump but its anything but a safe place people are just respectable on there so conversations dont get hateful or resentful plz dont confuse the two altright is a putdown to most of us because we want everyone to be successful regardless of what you and think
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was supposed to be sarcasm but i guess people dont understand my sense of humor 😐
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont get me wrong we have bad apples and there have been racist things posted but the sub has distanced its self from the past offensive posts the overwhelming majority of us want the american dream for everyone america isnt successful until everyone has a chance and opportunity for success i understand and respect peoples feelings about the past connection to the altright but it wasnt meant to turn into a white supremacy group it started out kind of like the tea party movement because the gop wasnt representing more center based ideas then it morphed into something it shouldnt have been
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its whatever you want it to be then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how is having a wall racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i never even mentioned that sub i havent even been on there i meant a sub that doesnt circlejerk obama as our lord and savior

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and there are other black people to look up to no one lists santa claus as their inspiration in life anyhow

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my black coworkers are like this with black customers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plot twist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,on the other side of this if its a white guy standing the theyre either a peeping tom or a pedophile
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i missed that part of the episode when spongebob snuck up behind patrick and started punching him in the head forced him to the ground and tried to take his gun gonna have to rewatch it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tervin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont know why anyone would be suspicious of a black person just standing around on a street late at night its not like black violence is out of control or anything yall be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks frequently use public transit when trafficking drugs because it eliminates the chance of them getting pulled overstopped and friskedsomething like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love how racist this sub is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you trying to simmer the zimmer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is going to sound ignorant as all get out but it comes from a place of compassion why are you guys still wearing hoodies go buy a couple shirts from banana republic theyre you never hear about a dude in a button down getting shot by the police
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you and your little brother start fights with assholes who have guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats actually a lot of well intending white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are we just going to pretend like the part where he attacked zimmerman never happened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that must explain comment you made then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair to the us ive had much better experiences being an arab in the us than i have in europe i dont know how europeans are about other races but a lot of them really dont like arabs here a good deal of the shit i get is because people think im black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im not im saying you can control one and not the other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all these years of girls calling me a bad bitch whos down to pixels wide and adjust the vertical padding
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre trying to combat racism with racism i dont see that as being helpful as for patrick and spongebob im a big fan
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats cuz white people can do basic math lets of the population but of the murders i wonder if the odds are in my favor right now oh yeah theyre not responsible for being a murderous class of the population because they get excused cuz slavery institutional racism blah blah blah
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im white and from indiana the rural part so let me approximate her thought process black people are always portrayed as dangerous on the news movies and all the stories my hillbilly friends repeat the only areas in my state that have a significant population of black people are also dangerous therefore i associate black people with danger if there is a black person around i feel anxious because this could indicate a dangerous situation i should run away from the black person before guns start appearing out of nowhere seriously thats how people think its pretty messed up i even saw it last night at a pool party in arizona a lot of black people hanging out having fun throwing the football around in the pool if its a group of white guys people would probably think its a bunch of broy guys if theyre a shade closer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thus seeing a black guy landscaping a few in southern california
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtumblrinaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is that wrong though what if shes had horrible experiences with black people black people are constantly telling white people not to invalidate their life experiences and generalizations about whites cops store owners etc why cant white people justify their biases with life experience me personally i live in baltimore and have been threatened intimidated mugged and scared exclusively by black people so when a black stranger approaches me im more cautious than when a white stranger approaches me thats not racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no the part where he tried to kill george zimmerman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cant flimflam the zimzam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it attempts to discredit the rationale behind avoiding a black man on the street at night tries to change the narrative by reducing it to some racist angle when its not racist to use statistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wasnt he confirmed to have been involved with the bloods though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the visual of an acheridden skinny pale year old redditor typing this message is making me laugh so hard im getting acid reflux
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rip the guy who had a criminal record and was shown on video to be physically fighting the cops and resisting arrest and reached for his gun he was a good boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this title should be black people searching for racism at every corner
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yup its definitely alive i see black people talking shit about white people every day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clothing and hood swagger is what causes these reactions in the first place race has a minimal effect a higher proportion of black people rep the hood life in the way they dress talk and walk that is the reason why people react more to black people than people of other races it more to do with the tendencies of the culture of that race than the race itself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe people just think you shouldnt be violent and not expect people to shoot you this mentality has nothing to do with racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do u ppl relate to this in any way u r all white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was right before zimmerman was found not guilty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i grew up in a small all white village in southern england one day a black guy was walking through the village and checking out the post office a few days later the post office got robbed and surprisingly they caught the culprit very quickly guess who it was they caught him so easily because a couple of the people living in the village had already called the police to report the suspicious behaviour of a black guy looking around the village the first time he came through
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,remindme year divorced
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this nigga came to bpt expecting people to circlejerk his i hate women rants httpiimgurcomhyazbyfgifv rtheredpill is that way my friend

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh so it is a good idea it would have an effect and people like you are battling against that effect taking place effectively making you culpable in the rapes of young women all for measly political points ill stick with teamignorant thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jiggaboo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if it wouldnt work then thats one thing its just an option on the table op said he was consciously alerting his behavior to seem less threatening isnt that the burden the shirt is if i wanted you to demean yourself i would send you to hm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe shes been downtown of a major urban area and realized that the only people that harass her on the streets are black people i get harassed every single time i go to downtown oakland
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i also dont randomly stand around in front of peoples houses but okay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey as soon as you apologize for your race committing over of the murders in the us despite accounting for only of the population
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha sorry tyrone i dont enjoy being mugged with a screwdriver
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,similarly look at that white guy just standing there minding his own business god what a huge racist he is i bet he is telepathically oppressing people of color as we speak
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,them ones catching the holy ghost rekt

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry to be a little racist but my phone is on and dimmed and i cant see anything in these pictures on this sub lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and this article is just about women who were fired from jobs imagine all the other fun ways we get discriminated against for wearing our natural hair out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,africanamericans you mean black women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so im a bit confused do these melanin enriched crime statistics not have hair or do they only have welfare
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol this chick i dated was full blackfull italian and she could get the nicest fro or perfectly straight hair with products and shit in her bathroom smelt like jersey in july but man did it look nice both ways anyways she had this half and half thing for a while straight in the front and fro in the back when she had a job interview or we were going to a white friends family function she would pull the bangs back and make it look like the whole thing was straight and people didnt think she was black anymore she had asian eyes but most people guessed her hispanic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kd is such a hot little slut
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if this is the cd guy resistingno cooperating with a person who has a gun to your head tends to end with you getting shot black or white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sweeping generalizations like this are counterproductive to improving race relations
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the gorilla wasnt illegally loitering outside of a business illegally selling merchandise while resisting arrest and keeping the police uninformed of his firearm that he reached for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,goddamn you have a victim mentality life sucks for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these comments fucking suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was shot because he reached for a weapon which he had on him and the store owner was not on top of him to where he could see it just because the state permits open carry does not mean he had an open carry permit not to mention it wasnt being openly carried it was in his pocket which is illegal even with a concealed carry permit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but why dont they
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aight hate to be real for a min but i distinctly remember black folk goin off on white people for getting harambe killed before we found out the kid was black lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly lol this is a stupid post its only gonna go to the top because a mod pinned it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exaclty i didnt see just white people going nuts over harambe i saw millenials of all races postng about it the sole intent of this post is divisive in nature even if they say its humor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah but we have a chance to put something on white folk so let it be bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but why dont they doe just asking dont mean any racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean i really dont care how it goes for me i was giving my opinion and it has been received clearly by some nappyhaired bitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive never seen this particular stat brought up but no its not okay for any percentage of the shooting to be unjustifiable however it is even less okay to take over events that have nothing to do with police violence burn down cities loot from innocent bystanders and local businesses chant black power and attack people of other races just to prove your point mlk was leagues and bounds more persuasive a leader of the black civil rights movement than blm is as a disorganized shitshow i support the families of all the people who died and im definitely not going to say any of the people who were shot deserved to die before being judged in a court of law but im also not going to jump to conclusions and call a cop racist before the facts are even released i want justice for those who were unjustifiably killed but they should be judged in a court of law not hiding behind their honest communityserving brothers in blue and a law that protects the good cops as well as the bad ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well we can all certainly agree on what not to do right or is this actually promoting looting cause if so really
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i activate my spell card change of race with this card i can change my race to black when on rblackpeopletwitter

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black monkeys finally learns human language but still cant spell for shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude shut up thats a map of ebonics it has little to do with actually minority populations much of the south speaks in a similar way regardless of their black population hence why connecticut has a similar disturbution as some parts of georgia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there were almost blacks killed by other blacks in blacks were killed by police gunfire that year

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hilarious i get it to be thug you have to not understand math no wonder it all makes sense now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well theres wage slaves minimum wage debt slaves pay off your loans bitch sex slaves and the slaves we all know and love slavery is about as old as human civilization itself beyond that even some ants do it throughout time slaves were treated better or worse depending on the culture and the regime american slavery was actually paltry compared to slavery at other times over million slaves were shipped to north america only made it and all african americans are their descendants you can blame the dutch for those deaths filthy inhuman slugs contrast this to south american colonization the native carribbeans were actually worked to death so spain brought in africans to continue their jobs plantation work in georgia is one thing but utterly deplorable conditions in caribbean plantations or peruvian silver mines is another far worse fate the encomienda system for instance was a brutal form of forced labor that effectively enslaved natives in exchange for the privilege of christianity and a little food americans tend to be a little close minded to think that slavery even in the americas really just boils down to workin by the massas house in reality slavery in america was actually one of the more humane systems of slavery in the history of the world if slavery can ever be called that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,silver lining got the fuck out of africa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i see nothing wrong here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is painfully true and thats why trump is successful in this race in the first place bluecollar folks who dont follow politics or give a fuck about racial issues are sick of being called racist sexist etc for not bending over for the democratic partys huge corrupted cock

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you could say the same about muslim terrorists kek
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,be more petty maybe tell that to chicago where black on black crime is rampant is the white man telling people to riot and destroy businesses no ferguson was an embarrassment for black communities could have worked together to improve the standard of living instead more crime fucking retards in this sub i swear
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,believing race is just skin deep but she thicc tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also donald trump has got all of these racists out here acting bold yeah im going to have to stop you right there its not trumps camp thats causing racial issues shit has been on the rise since well before he came into the spotlight im more apt to blame the al sharptons and barak obamas as well as the media for the race baiting david duke can run for whatever he wants hell not win
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,proportionality yes correct whites do make up a majority of the population but when you look at the proportionality of violent crimes and murders to police shootings its a different story i understand police brutality is a crime in the us but it is definitely not just a blacks problem or even just a whites problem as proportionally to of violent crimes they are shot more often stats of homicides committed by blacks of robberies committed by blacks aggrevated assault crimes involving weapons etc shooting stats white black unknown if we work out the proportion of people shot to of violent crimes for that race white not incl hispanics of violent crimes but victims to of police shootings overepresented black lower bound of violent crimes victims to of police shootings underepresented conclusively i think it is fair to say that comparing shootings simply to share of population is unfair as in not even one statistic are blacks underepresented sources
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people say crazy stuff lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shhhhh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are always exceptions i probably had more privilege than some whites so heres a reason that i would argue calling something white privilege is stupid and harmful as it would turn out not all white people are advantaged over other races even in america perhaps you could generalize that there is a higher proportion of white people who live privileged lifestyles compared to black people but then why not just call it upper class privilege the main difference between rich white kids and rich black kids who grew up in beverly hills is one group can say nigga when singing along to rap songs and one cant another point i have is would you consider black privilege a thing in black neighborhoods in some cities are black people privileged compared to white people in black highschools in parts of chicago i guarantee you white kids are mistreated in a lot of these kinds of places but we dont speak of any sort of privilege heirarchy because its taboo you probably can guess why white privilege makes it blatantly obvious that it refers to ones race and implies that someone is to blame for a certain injustice that is perceived but race actually hardly plays a part in this when you compare the lifestyles of upper class black people and upper class white people so instead of us further pushing a wedge in the divide between whites and blacks like weve done wonderfully so in the past years how about we try to stick together a bit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitey reporting in my sides cant take much more it is now my life mission to know a guy who knows a guy who is friends with a guy in the niggernavy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont worry man you can post niggernavy memes transcend skin colour

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does it matter come on lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,big lips give it away
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,katrina jade put some respeck on her name
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i really like the subtle racism of this post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gone jump off this infuriates me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unlike ops father the horse stuck around

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the problem is that you dont understand the legal definition of murder kill murder do you think the cop that shot the black man pointing the vape like a gun should be fired for killing an unarmed black man not every black person killed by cops was unarmed or doing nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe hes actually black andor was disciplined

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does it mean if im white and did this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that worked out just well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im picking not racist but i also am sometimes reminded to lock my door when there is a black person around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when it it got to weefee i fucking lost it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is seriously racist and the fact that hes acknowledging its racist and still admitting to doing is actually really sad i know no one will believe me but i am not white but indeed black in fact i am naturalized canadian originally from africa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not about race its about socioeconomic status which ties in to their appearance you wouldnt lock your doors of you see a group of black guys wearing business suits
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and adults of all brown races
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,idk man if some crackhead white guy started walking towards my car id lock my doors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop playing the victim card pull your fucking pants up and enjoy the fact that white people who know you like you for who you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah i get your point completely people definitely have their biases shits pretty deep rooted and messed up but a funny subreddit aint really the place to talk about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait a secondhe got a dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude they know karate

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cry me a river
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look out youths
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats some self hate bro i lock my car when i get in regardless of whos walking past joking aside blacks fearinghating blacks is exactly what society wants we could fix so much in this country if we came together as a people and decided to lovetrust each other wed see black business owners hiring black staff and black politicians catering to the needs of africanamerican lobbyistsinterest groups wed have a voice both economically and politically thad allow us to stand up against injustice in society honestly mock me or whatever but i hate this selfhatred bullshit as much as i hate colourism its fucking bullshit and only acts to hurt us as a people

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he is a god tier memer too umartinshkreli
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre getting downvoted becuase theres people on the sub here that go to the gym so that they can be the toughest guy in their class lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a misrepresentation society pushes everyone down nobody cares what color you are let alone what your problems are everybody needs to just shut the fuck up because nobody cares lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wonder who will complain first in i hope we get another we didnt get nominated for oscars part
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when the death toll of black on black crime is lower than police on black then you have an argument unpopular facts always get downvoted to oblivion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,from my experience black people get waaaaay more offended than white people tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youd think trump would love muslims though because according to his own perception of muslim people they have a lot in common they both hate women and dont respect religious freedom or lgbtq people like sometimes you would think that trump might be a muslim he clearly havent read the bible just saying also just to specify i dont think that most muslims are like that but rather that is what trumps and many conservatives belive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmaoooo totally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop cops from what exactly working having guns i dont understand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,📠📠📠📠📠📠📠
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,me too thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,have you ever actually called a white person a cracker its hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not exactly the same thing certainly but to make progress with the relationship between cops and black people in america there needs to be improvements in black culture like it or not it has become violent and only perpetuates a racists opinions further i think the heart of the issue lies in a large portion of poor people growing up without a father
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive never seen a white person be offended at being called white must only happen on the internet when black people comment on how white i am i just laugh because its funny and most dont mind if i crack a black joke either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a shame on both sides of the coin really i just wish social justice and political correctness would be about inclusion rather than some sort of inverted exclusion i feel like that was the intent of both termsideologies but theyve been corrupted to the benefit of some real assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or blacks killing cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats rich coming from the moderator that deletes almost every joke from white people about black people in the comment sections
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uuuuuggggghhhhh more of this bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are really trying to argue that the jordan killings per year done almost entirely by your black males is anecdotal evidence come on dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nopeno race baiting hoping on here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people flip the fuck out when they experience one ounce of racism its hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn this sub is really becoming shit dae hate white people cant we just have memes without this racist stuff and no i am not white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well thank god youre voting for another clinton who put millions of black fathers behind bars super predators and all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except the exact opposite is true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you dont think this statistic reflects any deep issues related to black culture that is the equivalent of plugging your ears and going lalalalalalalalalalala
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love code lyoko it has a lot going for it and the plot and character development is nice they also pretty much killed a classmate and replaced him with a holograph or something so that was different
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha yeah so relatable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,found the cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uimakeitseemweird
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well the statement is probably loaded if someone says youre so white chances are theyre taking the piss in some way its racist its like saying youre so black when someone does something bad if someone said to me youre so white and just mean that im white then why would i get upset words are only nasty when used in certain context otherwise theyre just words people need to chill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more whites are killed by police then blacks why isnt that an issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i definitely know whats thats like haha happens all the time with me because i have sex all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people are really trying hard to find things for which they can make fun of white people out of all races this fits white people the least it is born out of racism andor segregationism the woke white ally will go to great lengths to be accepted but will often fail always a white boy or someone who needs to shut up and listen while those who have a right to an opinion speak but at least every person of color with an inferiority complex can make some 🔥memes to affirm their victimhood fucking white people are so racist tbh fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah the most racist subreddit i know of is this one nothing but hundreds of comments insulting people for the color of their skin all responding to a post that insults someone for the color of their skin the irony is completely lost on them i am sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doesnt understand what how to be an emotionalized liberal i think he does understand all you have to do is watch the news and form your opinions from that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seriously fuck white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is it weird that the literal only reason i still have this in my subs is so that i can see how white people acting like black people think black people behave rhetorical question answer is yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mcchickenoutforharambe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seriously people with high karma accounts can sell out to corporations like ugallowboob likes on instagram is great for popularity but thats not what were discussing were talking about if one like your own means anything it doesnt

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn you people who cant take a joke in a joke sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmaoo all these people salty for saying she looks like jay z shes years old and looks like her dad get over it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if a nigga says that then he dont wanna be friends source am a nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao yall bag on white people all the time but once your own starts fucking fast food you throw a fucking bitch fit when you get roasted hahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of those african countries have officially apologized for their role in the slave trade the country that was the one buying and therefore encouraging the enslavement has not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whatever i have my own preferences people can down vote me as much as they want wont change the fact i think beyoncé looks like a weird troll
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all the teen girls retweeting 😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt you see on the tweet thats clearly how men apologize
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dear ladies stop getting upset over the smallest shit and you wont get half assed garbage apologies if you freak the fuck out in the same fashion for someone not doing the laundry as you would as someone cheating on you then yeah i guess im fucking sorry sorry i met your psycho ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe women are just pussies 🍆👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtumblrinaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre really insecure about your race huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mi negro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rihanna is dating travis scott
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,negro just means black sorry no white guilt or overpolitical correctness here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no you didnt lmao you repost for the karma points
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont even know what chris brown looks like is he the crying bitch or the man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what he say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not funny nor does it help get his point across either just makes him look like well i football player talking politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well guess white people are the real victims here s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ohhhhh thank you the horrible grammar had me thinking it was talking about the cashier
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you we do what we want whitepriv
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i do not support the existence of the police so i cannot agree with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is there a historical issue with being black cause every race can be slaves and were slaves at some point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if the idea is to be hella scary to people walking down the street this is a great costume
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the police as we know them do not protect us they protect the ruling class and their property as i mentioned earlier the police in the us originated from slave patrols their entire existence is based in institutional racism and i see no way for it to end if the police remain in their current state abolishing the police and instituting communal protection forces similar to what the panthers had is in my opinion much more alligned with the interests of the people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,explain why blackface is a historical issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so because some ppl did some racist shit in blackface all face makeup is racist either its all racist or its not if only white ppl cant get black face make up then thats kinda racist kinda like the n word only being ok for black ppl to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a white male who identifies as a black asian male with indian ancestry i find this offensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dicks out for larack
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can understand that but from what he says i can conclude that hes not a type of person that actually tried to take care of it but just instead wants a way to cover up yes i can understand that there are people who just cant help it but makeup wont make it any better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hope i dont smell like weed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe if you didnt call them cake face they wouldnt try so hard to cover up their low self esteem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you want another chance to change nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the moment african americans stop feeling victimized by arbitrary things like a word or blackface theyll be better for it im not at all saying that slavery doesnt have a socioeconomic impact on present day society i am not one of those ppl that thinks there is no racism anymore because of obama i am white but i try to be socially charitable and racially sensitive i have been told by black friends that only white ppl can be racist that i am some responsible for slavery even though im of eastern european decent no black slaves in eastern europe just white on white slavery im fine with shows like chappell and boondocks mocking white ppl but i could never get away with the reverse if face paint makes you feel oppressed thats entirely on you slavery and racism are serious real issues face paint isnt unless part of you wants to feel like the victim and make an issue out of nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,report cards was every black kids guaranteed nightmare made us behave for a week tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,omfg i read that as apeelementary reddit has ruined me

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not sure about now because i dont go to that sub as often anymore but rtumblrs deal with titles is that they would eviscerate you if you put the punchline in the title but i guess thats with every humor subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what so i guess weve run out of the white people shoot up schools joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hi mum and daughter i am blowing myself up for the name of allah see you soon in heaven so i can fuck you when allah makes you virgins love dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the notion that white people dont season their food is so fucking stupid and its not even funnythe watermelon thing nobody actually talks about unironically anymore and there was least some basis for it since watermelons grow well in the south are delicious and cheap to produce compared to other crops theres historical proud historical basis for freed black farmers growing watermelon which was turned into a stereotype the same way the uncle tom character from the novel was turned into a racist caricature by racist ass minstrel shows europeans colonized half the fucking planet to get to spices the vast majority of culinary tradition and cooking and dishes are from one of the european disciplines of cooking fuck this annoys me school shooter shit sure laugh it up doing stupid dangerous stuff but being scared of someone with a skintone darker than tan naming their kids dumb shit kids talking shit to their parents cool make fun of all that how about being milquetoast jackasses listening to soft jazz and wearing mom jeans and soccer and shit all fair game but fuck off with this food nonsense

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we wuz kings n shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that quote implies that the poor have to pee in streets sleep under bridges and steal bread anyone can make a better life for themselves if they want to the problem is that most black people just dont want to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if the truth is racist then i guess im a racist i went to elementary middle and high school in a poor town with a majority black population there was probably of the black kids there who wanted an education with the other acting up in class smoking weed after and sometimes during school harassing the teachers and not doing any class work whatsoever its ingrained in black culture to not get an education to not become smart and to stay lower class for their entire lives because thats what black people do im not some uppermiddle class yuppie who hates black people because theyre different im somebody who has seen black culture since a young age and knows what it does black people arent poorer on average because the white man keeping them down they are poor because they dont want a life outside of being poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ha cuz youre black

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the leading cause of racism is these days is black people behaving like black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao everyone taking this post this seriously this isnt bpt more like white people commentary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have shit happens
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well on the race side of things desegregation did start in so we were beginning to move in the right direction as far as equal rights at that time even though it was and still is a long slow and painful road for many this is when true change in america began for black people also if i am not mistaken the showed incredible growth and prosperity for the american people perhaps this is what he is referring to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,depends how old you are past the teenage yearsearly twenties it becomes increasingly difficult to care about this text mind game shit its not even about respect unless youre russell crowe in a beautiful mind you aint got the brainpower to juggle fifteen conversations in your head assigning to each their proper nonchalantlooking delay while simultaneously trying not to fall off the roof of your house as you attempt to fix the awful paint job you did last time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you always find the best ones when you stop looking its bullshit but true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly i think there is are you saying that race is an actual factor that our very genes are different and impact us i dont think the colour of my skin means shit im also not an american so i dont carry all three baggage they do so if a white woman fully goes in to be black i dont care im actually glad cause race is stupid and so are you fuckboi
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha yeah i sure know what that is like having sex with females sure is great right gang
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can someone explain to me how in the black community its considered disloyal and despicable if a woman cheats but completely normal and accepted almost encouraged for men to do so is it just bigotry or is there some reason or background im missing

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,two big ones while people of color make up about percent of the united states population they account for percent of those imprisoned african americans however account for percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just percent of the us population
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do blmers feel silent or maybe it just seems that way because throwing a temper tantrum doesnt actually solve problems they sabotage candidates that actually support their cause and leave disasters wherever they get enough people to start listening the political process in the modern world will never be controlled by the loudest or most disruptive group in the news cycle the calling card of millenial progressivism is aimless awareness and political impotence occupy wall street the wage gap crisis and black lives matter are just millenials pretending to have real political weight by being noisy it changes nothing you want change this year was the fucking year to do it if i had two hundred angry citizens in any us congressional district willing to volunteer time for a cause i could get a candidate elected to the us house that would represent them over of americans believe were heading in the wrong direction no longer identify with a party approval ratings for congress are at an all time low people want change and not a single fucking person is willing to do a shred of campaign work to get someone elected who will solve their problems
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah noise doesnt accomplish anything you need votes you need campaigns you need organization but no one want to put in work they just want to be loud
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this misunderstanding is what pains me most media attention is not power i said it earlier in this thread if you had two hundred volunteers in any congressional district you could win a house seat fifty could elect a mayor blm has thousands of people in it yet not much is changing thats because its an outrage machine rather than something that can actually protect black lives you want change in your town elect a new prosecutor elect a new sheriff elect a new mayor these are all things you can impact but no one does because theyd rather be on cnn than actually improve their environment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh boy this gin be a shitstorm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,classic little piece of shit quote hell tell this story to all his little homies in weeks like hes tough assure you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wont suck dick for weed but will fight a person of your choosing in atlanta hmu

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people always leave out the shit that makes them look like trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts are racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lots of sex lots of violence lots of drugs being an allaround immoral criminal thats what it means to be black 👍🏿
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo real questions do yall love cheating on your girl or what am i the only one that thinks its not cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is about as correct as someone saying black people are more upset about a few statistically irrelevant police killings than black on black crime also the alt right considers blm a terrorist group only interested in violence true which has literally nothing to do with equality we they are outraged by the violence and ignorance of blm not anything to do with equality inequality or sjws
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rofl but statistically speaking that confirms that black people are more likely to commit crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why cant everyone just all agree that everyone sucks and we hate each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats totally it the teachers are all against her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yaaaaaaaawwwwwnnnn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but white people have jobs instead
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine if black lives matter were a good org with intentions to promote equality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine if blm was actually nah ill just stop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo why would they do that then you wouldnt have to buy another one business shit bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i feel like i had to wait for you to say this because if i said this i would come across as racist and people would shut me down thats pretty fucked up if you think about it i personally feel that a lot of blm protestors are quickly moving towards what i would call domestic terrorism blocking highways assaulting students etc and those specific people are giving the whole movement a terrible image and name i think thats a very reasonable view to have and yet i cant voice that in public because im afraid that my skin color isnt dark enough to be allowed to hold that opinion without it coming back to bite me in the ass somehow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tell that to my city that got ripped apart by blm over a justified shooting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im from st louis it fucking started here so dont tell me im talking out my ass there are still destroyed buildings left from when they destroyed north county
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm also starts riots and damages private property as well as block freeways blm is neither a peaceful or respectable organization
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all lives matter they do they should definitely be entitled to life all lives matter does not mean all people welcome do you really not see that those are two entirely different things if i say all lives matter does that mean all lives matter and nothing else does at all other than saving lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mlk fought for a real cause and had a real reason to be angry blm just cause trouble for the sake of it at least thats what it looks like to me privileged millennials looking for a cause to fight
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess affirmative action isnt good enough ☕️🐸
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you honestly think a man with all that money is going to keep himself exclusive to a nappy haired black woman lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lock the thread before the differing opinions come in so we can protect our free speech boys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this what race baiting is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes its because black people have a lower iq than white or orientals the dumber you are the more crime seems like a good idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do black people really consider bill clinton their nigga considering what his wife has said about them a few examples – in after bill clinton lost his bid for a senate seat hillary lashed out at campaign manager paul fray calling him a fcking jew bastard this outburst was witnessed and confirmed by people so it definitely happened – as first lady hillary called young black men superpredators indicating that she thought all young black males were violent criminals she also said we have to bring them to heel like young blacks are the same as dogs despite thinking this was incredibly racist blacks still support hillary – while serving in the us senate hillary tried to make a joke that disparaged a civil rights icon and demeaned all people from india i love this quote its from mahatma gandhi he ran a gas station down in st louis for a couple of years mr gandhi do you still go to the gas station asked clinton – in hillary said i am adamantly against illegal immigrants she also as a senator voted to construct a wall between the us and mexico considering the main proof of trumps racism is that he opposes illegal immigration and wants to build a wall isnt it odd that hillary gets off for having said the same thing – during the democratic primaries hillary clintons campaign started the birther rumors questioning obamas us citizenship they even circulated the now famous picture of obama in full muslim garb somehow trumps campaign to get obama to release his birth certificate is racist but hillarys role in starting the birther movement is not – also during the presidential race hillarys husband bill said this of obama a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee hillary didnt say this one but her husband did and she certainly never disavowed it – shortly after announcing her candidacy hillary said all lives matter in a black church i dont think this one is racist but lefties black activists and hillary herself all do so it makes the list plus as is the case with most of this stuff if trump had said it liberals would freak the hell out – in november of hillary called people in this country illegally illegal aliens trump is a racist when he says illegal aliens why isnt hillary – in april of this year hillary joined nyc mayor bill de blasio on stage at a democratic fundraiser for a scripted joke about how lazy black people are the two liberals made reference to colored peoples time which is a superracist way of saying black people are chronically tardy and lethargic – april was a great month for hillarys racism as she also made a comment disparaging native americans she said she had experience dealing with wild men when they get off the reservation in essence she said native americans are savages who must be segregated from the rest of society – on a black radio show hillary pandered to black voters by claiming she always carries hot sauce in her purse it was racist when donald trump pandered hispanics by eating a taco bowl but not racist when hillary pandered blacks how does that work

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i used to think it was a joint instead of a small country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lifes easy when you actually know your father how many baby mamas yo dad got is that why that tree is so big
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well you know maybe a certain group established control of our countrys media and education system so they could establish divides in our country effectively making it easier to further control the divided whole dr tony martin used his black literary award winning books in the classroom to teach the intimate history blacks had with a group of people this was a controversial ordeal you wont find mentioned in any modern american curriculum his books seem to do pretty well on amazon anyway maybe a group of people dominated the slave trade straight up wrecked competitorsdebtors and inspired thousands of white fanboys basically theyre the slavetrade apple constantly innovating and breathing new life into the negro industry im not white brown or black but maybe this show includes bigger players than these simple colored puppets

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real though i hate the alt right as much as the next guy but the left on reddit has been toxic as fuck the past few weeks nobody gives a shit about facts they just want to spew hate at anybody who isnt actively opposing trumpalt right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first of all thats a giant generalization i would say more that reddit enjoys when anyone is hurt it doesnt have to be a female i dont think you really watch the video because its not a girl its a guy who pushes her down and not only that but theyre in the classroom where she should be studying and learning like the other people who are being annoyed in that class are also you dont know how long theyve been doing that it looks like he was pretty frustrated as if theyve been annoying him maybe all or all day but regardless they need to sit their asses down and stop acting like a rowdy animals and they wont get treated roughly like a rowdy animals the have my hand with your example of the gym thing on a desk versus walking alone at night is that if you walk alone at night youre not always liable to get mugged also theres no exact explanation as to why he just happened to be at the wrong place and the wrong time but if youre on a desk that means you had to voluntarily do it and when you step on someone that means you voluntarily were not paying attention to what you were doing and who was around you so thats a totally different situation because the flipping of the desk can really be avoided as far as getting hurt on like being mugged at night which really you have no control over also you need to calm your ass down before you go and make assumptions for the rest of the world because while i found it funny that doesnt mean i condone violence against women i just found it funny that her ass got handle like that after acting so disrespectfully truthfully a teacher could have prevented all that from happening but regardless it was funny whether or not i would do the same thing in person is a whole different situation because just like you laugh at something that happens in the movie doesnt mean youre going to do that same action your damn self laughing is not the same thing as condoning lastly yeah i hope you dont meet any of us either cuz you sound a bit like a little bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude fuck is this rniceguys shit doing here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thank you this post is retarded and completely out of context
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,antiwhite people obvi
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look at all them lil niglets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reddit translation i want karma i want more karma
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its still not a muslim ban thatd be like saying that iraq has a white person ban for banning americans french english germans and italians from entering their country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plenty of antiwhite racist liberals out there these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,coincidentally those happen to be the same countries the majority of the hijackers came from and also coincifuckindeftly play a major role in our economic and military interests in the region its almost like trump instituted an ineffectual unconstitutional xenophobic ban to rile up his supporters while at the same time roughly maintaining the status quo in the region at least in terms of american economic and military assets in the middle east all while turning foreign opinion harshly against the united states am i getting that right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one of trumps campaign promises literally was a muslim ban this is his attempt at that promise no one ever said it was an efficient muslim ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you actually did your research youd know trump used a bill passed in by obama to do this and it only effects nations that have had their hightech passport equipment fall into nongovernment hands which is why these seven nations are now banned has literally nothing to do with them being muslims but go on be a fucking moron
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are now banned from rblackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump called it the muslim ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people post dumb shit no that is something some people do i guess i cant argue with an intellectual titan who figured out this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get out of here with your sound logic ruining these tired ass jokes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and they say black people dont like water but look at all this grass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitey didnt kill all the native americans disease from trade routes did then whitey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you do a poor job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know i was being sarcastic about whites claiming reverse racism exists lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then they die
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if he wasnt white i wouldve just phrased the question a word differently you fuckin retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is quickly turning into a political post so let me hop on the wagon the milo supporters arent starting fires and beating people up the opposition however is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did black people just acknowledge that there are actually different types of white one step at a time guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i listened to a couple mlk speeches yesterday and have been reading some of his most famous quotes poor man must be rolling over in his grave we need him or someone like him now even more than we did back then returning hate for hate multiplies hate adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that hate multiplies hate violence multiplies violence and toughness multiplies toughness in a descending spiral of destruction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know if youre really as cynical as you sound you might like to know that suicide is always an option
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nahhh ill buy another trump hat for my crew i prefer institutions that actually work for the people not jewish lawyers trying to tear america down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well considering that most of the sjwaltleft are pretty antiwhite anticis and misandrists i think its just as fitting as calling a white nationalistneo nazi alt right they are basically the opposite side of the stupid coin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,muslims have a higher chance of blowing up planes i guarantee it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you obviously just dont deserve them at their best
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its basically the same for men though a circumcision removes the frenulum as well which has the highest nerve density sorry but if youve been mutilated youll never know the true euphoria of an orgasm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tendies cmon yall
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,staying relevant with the youths or something similar to what jayz kanye and most recently gucci is doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hold up for just a second this has nothing to do with anything but just stop what youre doing and listen to seconds of song
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wyd tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn bruh when you get upvotes because nobody can argue widdem puns

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ou in mandarin is a long o sound as in home not an oo sound as in zoo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this exchange is how you know its all white people on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hopefully they tazed and beat him to teach that fucker to never run again he could have gotten cops ran over in the process of chasing his dumb ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so why dont a bunch of black people just have sex with her to shut her up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub should just be called rwhitepeoplesayingnigger its a bunch of people pretending to talk black and half the time the posts have no evidence of even being posted on social media by a black person and its not even a good joke its just asking people to commit an assassination
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dear black people stop committing crimes and the police will let you be i promise
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how me not wanting people to encourage assassination attempts makes me a trump supporter this happens when i fail to only make ardent antitrump statements im not his supporter nor did i vote for him but i also think calling for violence is wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gold train starts here choo choo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres no evidence for any accusation made in that picture its fake news
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,truth be told id take a death penalty for america to get that nigga out of office at least my name will be in history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is why im glad black people dont vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpsyoutubeuecdvwcvrc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you advocating the assassination of the president elect its like you people are gradually getting more and more deluded and you just circlejerk here in your echo chamber so you never realise how ridiculous and absurd you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and im here right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first things first rest in peace uncle phil
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i came fast like in white neighborhoods got no shame bout it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he doesnt play school so id give him a break
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably in the lines of thats racist asshole dont use that word
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is what happens when you take too many dick pics and not enough people call you out on it you start thinking sending images of your dick is cool desirable smh dude is lost harambeweeps
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,portuguese
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black murder by whites account for less than of all murder in the united states that figure of less than a percent also includes hispanics killing blacks due to the fact that the fbi categorizes latinos as white in any recorded crime statistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh this entire thread is rtumblrinaction lmfaoo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you especially the theatre bit managers already up our ass to upsell and nobody is making your fat ass purchase anything in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtumblrinaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit man its almost like these people are individuals and their skin color doesnt determine their thoughts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,careful youre breaking the narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody actually answered you so im gonna give you my two cents on it gang bangers are really a product of the environment white peoples put them in post slavery black on black crime is a product of white neglect i dont think these things are as ignored as you think they are everyone talks about the chicago murder rate and try to preach nonviolence and rising above their circumstances but the fact is theyre two different issues because cops being scared of someone based on their enough to kill them is plain racism gang banging is a reaction to extreme poverty where people dont feel they have an option other than fall into it because rising above has become a fever dream for a lot of people along with the self perpetuation because if youre seeing bodies every week on your block it desensitize you to death
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn its almost as if white people arent all the same person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt itt salt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im guessing he was just a gud boi on his way to collegeno idea how he got there at all tbh fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what the fuck how come rblackpeopletwitter is literally the only sub that gets this reddit is so guilty of this hypocrisy i came to this sub for memes not for race issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you protest something many people feel strongly sbout you are gling to get flak it has nothing to do with race also rioting is not protesting people destroying property of others that have nothing to do with the situation makes you look asinine
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a little disingenuous when one of the wealthiest people in the world claims that society is out to get him same thing when jennifer lawrence complains about the made up wage gap as the highest paid actress in the world
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they get locked because it is super racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im white i never dealt with oppression so i dont care
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kapernick was adopted by white parents and went to one of the best high schools in california i doubt he had many initial struggles
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its gotten to a point now where racism has for the most part switched sides
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure but you dont get to claim that youre personally oppressed when youve lived a cushy life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you claimed to be a poor sex slave i think a lot of people would call you out then same with kaepernick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color he is a black personperson of color so yes he is saying that society is out to get him personally maybe read the things youre defending
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then hes no better than a male feminist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,while i respect his first amendment right and the message hes trying to communicate it was pretty disrespectful hes a first class douche imo mulatto squidward lookin ass bih
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,adopted and raised by a white family too those whites sure hate all black people generalizations are the bane of all movements these days saying all black people are oppressed or all white people or all cops etc is the problem also have a solution when you protest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,individual racism societal oppression ive met individuals who were racist against white people but im not about to claim i was somehow oppressed by the entire nation because of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice strawman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course racism exists that doesnt mean that theres systemic oppression against black people in the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure but hes not hes claiming that he is personally oppressed along with all other black peoplepoc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyd probably ban me before locking the thread if the mods are already on this convo then genuine kudos for not instantly banning me half the time i say something unpopular on a subreddit i get an instant permanent ban regardless of how innocuous it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sure youve seen crime stats fam prison stats arent like that for no reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,duh man its still a straw man since its intentionally misrepresenting my argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the comment that got me banned from rthedonald lets be real guys trump and pence have said some pretty awful shit the last week of course people are going to be talking about it i also got banned from rsocialism for simply being against unchecked immigration despite it being a belief that karl marx shared and hes on their sidebar renoughtrumpspam banned me for some stupid shit too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god bless her she couldnt whip her dick out for harambe but she did her darnedest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kaepernick is claiming that he is personally oppressed in the us despite living a cushy middle class life and going essentially straight from childhood into the nfl thanks to his football talent for a person like him who has led an extremely privileged life to claim that he is oppressed is disingenuous that is my entire argument all im saying is that his claim feels insincere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you replied to me dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color as a black personpoc he is claiming to be personally oppressed thats like a fast food worker saying all fast food workers are underpaid and then you claiming that he wasnt including himself for some reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uh yeah no ones saying he doesnt have the right why is this complicated for liberals
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone does that to everyone regardless of race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racism systemic oppression i never claimed he didnt suffer from racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive posted this quote so many times why are so many people defending a quote they havent read i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color as a black personpoc he is claiming to be personally oppressed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rich people are far less likely to ever experience any form oppression wealth is the greatest position of power you can occupy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the goal is to draw attention and start a conversation what you want him to stand outside every local and state police department thats ever discriminated against black people because hes only allowed to protest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not what im arguing thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kind of hard to protest black oppression as a black man that makes million per year
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you have the right to say and do a lot of awful things are you saying you should do and say awful things just because you have a right to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its because this sub is mostly full of white kids and white kids are so sensitive these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it doesnt black people are believing the leftist lie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a rblackpeopletwitter post that hasnt hit the front page and posts that are vaguely antiwhite get upvoted here not saying its right or wrong but its how it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,race baiting how pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plaidvillain should fucking die in a jail cell like dumbass crazy bitch sandra bland
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably by being a fucking nigger
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,antiracism laws are racist black people find everything and anything racist so it gets really hard to figure out what actually is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont apologize
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it doesnt africanamericans do a pretty good job of it themselves single motherhood and victim culture is a vicious perpetrator to poverty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope racism stems from your inability to look at that statment ask why then have an honest conversation about race racism steams from people like you slinging the accusation of racism at anyone critical of problems in the american black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what about the irish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the mods are nazi sjws
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the mods are nazi sjws and the members of this sub are white people who like to say nigga and call real black people uncle toms when theyre not commies like them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,something like of black people who are murdered are killed by other black people thug culture glorifies and perpetuates ignorance and violence neither of these facts are racist but people cant even discuss them without you crying racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,notallblacklivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt be too sure about that next generation will have its own thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did she join the gorillalivesmatter movements
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if african americans are a byproduct of european entrepreneurship why are you fighting against white supremacy you wouldnt even exist without whitey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a rock doesnt try to kill you for wearing a red shirt unlike some people in the ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,should have post that on rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,real talk she look like the type of bitch to suck you off then suck you dry
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thor be getting hammered at frat parties
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cumbox t r i g g e r e d
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine if a white person made a post about black people in this same manner it would be considered racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,talmbout ahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are people doing this on purpose now or what
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where do you think the word slave comes from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i hate white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i bet nobody on rblackpeopletwitter actually experienced any injustices done by this country maybe your parents or grandparents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess its because im white but it just dont get this stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit i had something for thissomething about leslie jones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah only black people can tell other black people that rioting in the street is a bad idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ayyye made it in before it got locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because its not true and to the extent it is even close it was indentured servitude or debt slavery which is not actual slavery there children werent forced into slavery at birth they werent forced to breed against their wishes and if the person they were indebted to wasnt a crook they were freed once the debt was payed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,chrome tracking scares me tho bruh cant have google knowing i like latex midget shemale bukkake
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he doesnt mean a literal script theyre not all dramatic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is bpt were all white here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the longer we play black vs white the longer the plays the its a distraction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what if its a jew saying it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wowits almost as if race baiting should not be a thing you busters love to not enforce yalls own rules when its convenient
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure is a whole lot of race argument baiting bullshit in here lately
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love that absolute nonsense like this gets upvoted because it conforms to peoples ideas of history race was almost synonymous with nationality back then english was a race so was scandinavian croatian montenegrin dalmatian south italian north italian etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt dont read good
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea and its got some high level vocab
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because money isnt glorified stuff is you can have someone living in a shack feeling like he owns the world because he has rims on his impala rap culture heavily relies on expensive products to show someone is successful so you end up with people buying expensive products to prove that they are successful even when they arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so she made him look like his papa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not really a black thing but a majority of mainstream rappers are black and so are their fans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,deadass them blades wasnt playin no games fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that nigga barber is a wizard with the clips
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,buhh shudder with how filthy she probably is if you throw flour on her itll just combine with her yeast infection to make some nasty ass dough
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im getting fed up with all the lip ive been getting might start enslaving yall again in seriousness in america no one is a victim and black people who play the victim card are trash i learned this from successful black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre gross though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meta title

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you can tell its a good joke because it has to be explained 👌
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bitch make yo food wit the hands she jerk dick off wit dawg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do people think trump doesnt like black people he seems pretty cool with everyone as long as they were born here and like bacon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hot ass air sometimes known as farts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hermione being physically described to being white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rule bro this is a warning
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont have a problem with hermione being portrayed by a black woman but denying that everyone including jkr imagined hermione as white is silly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not to mention the ucla shooting where they called the guy white at first and then he wasnt even close
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought thats what this post is supposed to do black people are victims
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,search engine optimization
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,huge trump supporter so ill take my downvotes up front hes said some racist shit some really racist shit it really fucking bothers me but you could come out on stage in full klan attire and it still wouldnt be as condescending or racist as hillary saying she keeps hot sauce in her purse i live in la yall dont really get how serious this illegal immigration shit is look up skid row whole blocks of downtown taken over by illegal immigrant homeless for decades ill take the guy who doesnt really fuck with me but at least treats me like a human being over the lying bitch who tries to befriend you on some fake shit and then fucks you the first chance she has bill clinton put more black men in jail than any other human being alive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,started by the clinton campaign too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that statement isnt even related to race in the slightest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i would make a comment but i understand how sensitive a particular mod is about talking about race in race based threads thankfully reddit doesnt require email
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol blacks am i right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpslimgvzabxu
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but i mean the reverse doesnt yield the same concept typing in white teen doesnt give me stories of white teens who murdered or raped or have been killed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youths is almost exclusively used for black teens
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i grow a tumor every time i see one of your comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey between you and me youre still a bitch enjoy being blocked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shouting nigger at you late at night still number on the list
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just to get this straight you think its more likely that the people in the hood causing violence are gonna graduate college and get service industry jobs than it is likely that illegal immigrants do work outside of low wage agriculture thats interesting i mean youre wrong and enough americans know it that theyre gonna elect trump but its cool that you think that you know cause being is cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah youre right i love her jobs plan of being a woman and it being her turn awesome how shes gonna fix our trade deals by accepting bribes and so sick how shes under felony investigation by the fbi for treason great gal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do black dudes love dbz so much even more than white dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well stop committing crimes jackass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats fair big dogs arent for everyone personally i think any dog that shakes when it barks isnt a real dog i wish i had a picture of my sisters dog she looks like a srat and it about that size too how do you even pet a dog that fucking small
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,old white guy im telling you this is that colored girl from the super bowl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats only if you use if you use then you have a condom in between the condoms that would usually rub together and therefore no friction so youre good
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no need to be hateful he just asked for some examples
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,isnt it racist to spend this much attention on what colour a character is seems like those sjws are more racist than anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone post this in rthedonald
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for the examples a lot of those points seem to be directed mostly towards illegal immigrants which isnt exactly a race issue people willing to break the law are generally not as scrupulous as for the following comment sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanicsa tough subjectmust be discussed the majority of crimes are not committed by blacks or hispanics but on average blacks and hispanics are more likely to commit these crimes white people outnumber black people by a pretty large amount but some of the arguments about his sexism are just completely ridiculous in his book trump the way to success trump wrote beauty and elegance whether in a woman a building or a work of art is not just superficial or something pretty to see so its okay to call a woman beautiful and elegant and its okay to call a building beautiful and elegant but if you address both buildings and women in one sentence youre sexist sorry but that doesnt fly he even mentioned theres more to women than their superficial qualities but i guess its okay to ignore that completely overall i think trump is an unfit presidential candidate and not a very pleasant human being but honestly i think people are going way too far trying to discredit him attempting to get people worked up over literally nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kids these days cant take a fucking joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this a safe space now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jerking off to porn is cheating now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought this was the monkey filter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,guuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes shadynasty yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,might be the only graduation ceremony they get to go to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some homies dont make it bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the lower the gpa the louder the family
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love how they take being disruptive and obnoxious as a badge of honor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right to life huh tell that to the millions of babies murdered by abortion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,should there be single payer housing as well where do we stop isnt shelter also a basic human necessity what about food
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people on the crowd when you graduate awesome black people in the crowd assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well most people arent very proud of graduating high school you have to be from a fucking failure family to be proud of passing high school
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol youre clearly overly emotional about this whole thing bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you going to make me say it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres an extra s in parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they dont get to go to too many graduations so they dont know how to behave
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,time and effortlessly effortlessly the and the the the witcher computer to my computer i my computer computer my was wondering to how display php the the international your own site own site for more h h in japan forum information japan ut ut to be able i i was in you cherry
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your parents lol who gives a fuck about your parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,graduating high school is the biggest thing theyll amount to of course the parents and family are gonna fuck crazy white and asian parents know that next is college and to get a good job before they can be satisfied with their kids accomplishments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a social commentary i think this reflects how different racessocioeconomic groups view graduation poor minorities see graduation as an accomplishment deserving of public recognition and praise as something truly noteworthy wealthy white families see graduation as a something youre supposed to do sure white people celebrate too but they generally dont have the whole extended family at a high school graduation this phenomenon is seen all all education levels i have seen black families at medical school graduations from prestigious universities disregard the instructions to withhold applause also they interrupted the announcer who was informing the crowd of where each graduate would be going post graduation im black myself and this disappoints me i would be embarrassed if my parents couldnt follow simple courtesy that everyone else managed to figure out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same as rblackpeopletwitters using black fonts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people paying for drugs vs when theyre paying child support
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats worse is when they celebrate middle or jr high school graduations hahahah such low expectations if you celebrate every little thing then there is no need for big things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meh if you cant keep up with the program to know youre kid is next then who cares names being called is like fantasy football nobody cares about your team other than yourself follow along and just cheer wildly when you know your kids name is supposed to be called toning down celebration goes against the nature of the event
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its hard to convince the internet you grew up a po black chil when youre referencing the parent companies of higher class chain restaurants
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like you can afford the olive garden
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they have no inside civilized normal contributing member of society voice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,give me your address and ill double down your heart rate to zero
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because this sub is a minstrel show full of mostly nonblack people and most people that arent black in america dont really know shit about black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh no is the little boy triggered go back to your safespace heres a httpswwwredditcomrthedonald
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,scoobys black now theyre just gonna make scooby black now thats what theyre gonna do theyre just gonna make scooby black now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthedonald will be triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly hearing other people be racist makes me not care if white people are racist if were all going to be racist cant really fault those who are better at it than others
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love the argument yes your country spends so much on defense to help stabilize the entire world not to invade countries willy nilly what a steaming turd your comment is youre not helping anyone besides yourself other countries start building nukes on their own because their ally in the west decided to do budget cuts thats bad for everyone other countries already have nukes contrary to what propaganda tells you other countries wouldnt use nukes as soon as they have them because it would mean the end of their existence youre not whats stopping them to use nukes and you talk about global security was vietnam global security of was it just a simple invasion because you are warmongering fucks its time to drop the act its time to accept you spend so much on defense so you can kill and invade other countries this global security bullshit is feelgood mentality that you tell yourself to believe the us isnt fucked up god i hate americans brainwashed fucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because you want to be contrarian even though you know hes speaking broadly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah fuck the next family that want to hear their child graduate

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks is a cute misnomer blacks are subsaharans culture is cannibalism religious heritage is voodoo subsaharans produce zero commodities making them a liability for all other cultures in this instance subsaharans are cannibalizing others ceremonies they act without moral compass subsaharans have very low cultural iqs meaning it is very challenging for them to adapt and making it impossible for them to legitimately succeed

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its always funny how depending on the narrative a year old is a boy or a man a year old who gets in a car accident and kills some people will be called an adult but in this zimmerman case people called a athletic year old a kid to make it sound like zimmerman shot and killed a grade schooler
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you not doing that but in reverse

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fau poll finds trump edging out clinton in florida murphy and rubio poised for tough senate race boca raton fla august – republican nominee donald trump leads democrat hillary clinton in florida to percent with libertarian gary johnson taking percent and percent undecided according to a new survey by the florida atlantic university business and economics polling initiative fau bepi in the florida race for the us senate democrat patrick murphy and republican marco rubio lead by wide margins before their respective party primaries on tuesday aug with rubio leading murphy percent to percent in a potential general election matchup in november for the presidential race both candidates are underwater in terms of their favorability ratings in florida trump scores a percent favorable and percent unfavorable rating while clinton has percent favorable and percent unfavorable rating clinton meanwhile has a loyalty score of percent those who have a favorable opinion and are voting for her while trump has a loyalty score of percent trump leads among males percent to percent but trails clinton among women percent to percent independents are voting for trump by a wide margin of percent to percent trump leads among white voters to percent but trails with african americans to percent as well as hispanics to percent the race between clinton and trump among hispanics in florida is closer than it is nationally said monica escaleras phd director of the bepi some of that is probably the cuban vote trumps support among latinos in florida is helping him stay competitive clinton is beating trump in three of the four age groups she leads with to year olds by three points to percent to voters to percent while those over provide her the strongest support at to percent trump leads among to voters to percent trumps strongest regional support is in the western part of florida where he leads to percent and in the north at to percent trump also leads in the central region to percent clintons support is in south florida where she leads to percent the top issue for voters was dissatisfaction with government at percent followed by jobs at percent immigration at percent and isis at percent the top quality for voters is experience at percent followed by commanderinchief at percent trustworthiness at percent and focus on the economy at percent wanting an outsider was mentioned by percent of respondents kevin wagner phd associate professor of political science at fau and a research fellow of the initiative said that despite the national trend the presidential race in florida remains close and is within the surveys margin of error the fact that both mr trump and secretary clinton are significantly upside down in their favorability ratings could make it difficult for either to move substantially ahead he said clinton likely got a boost from the fact that floridians chose experience as the top quality they are looking for in their presidential candidate but floridians also chose dissatisfaction with government as their top issue which likely favors mr trump the florida poll was conducted aug the polling sample was a random selection of registered voters the democratic primary consisted of registered democrat likely primary voters with a margin of error of percent at a percent confidence level the republican primary consisted of registered republican likely primary voters with a margin of error of percent at a percent confidence level the general election poll consisted of registered likely voters with a margin of error of percent at a percent confidence level
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy fuck that article is full of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they didnt wanna be called uncle tom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha yeah screw people forming their own opinions fall in line just what clinton wants
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i too cant believe black people sometimes dont think the way i think they should
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,judging by the use of hindi youre from india amd judging by your
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because dems think they own them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not saying that trump is a good candidate but the clintons have put more black people in jail because of bills policies mainly than probably any other president in the last years but lets face it were all screwed this election it doesnt matter who wins
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot of black people like trump hes powerful rich has a freakin golden toilet trophy wife a plane a chopper drove a lambo hes everythign they want to be big boss nigga get shit done
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,huehue like democratic policies havent screwed over the black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its almost as if rblackpeopletwitter isnt actually frequented mostly by black people but by white people who like to laugh at black people making teh funnies on le twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like robert byrd an actual kkk leader and hillary clinton mentor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because that goes against the liberal narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clinton puts millions of black people in jail calls young black men super predators husband supports mandatory sentencing that breaks apart black families part of establishment that has been active in decline of blacks in america for decades calls robert byrd head figure of the kkk a mentor trump hires literally thousands of black workers in his businesses almost made ben carson vp msm trump is racist black people oh ok well vote for the same people that keep hurting us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id support hillary but blacks should probably support trump he outlined a real solution to stop your babymammas getting shot accidentally on street corners whereas hillary used the same old you gotta work with communities blaglh blah blah etc which means nothing trump is by far the best candidate for those who identify with the black communtity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you had asked how they waste more than straight couples who are unable or unwilling to have kids then my answer would be that they waste an equal amount if a couple has children then they waste none as per tradition a couple would get married as preparation to a major financial decision like raising children this was largely achieved through religious and social stigmatization of having children outside of wedlock but even years ago marriage was a business transaction to join families in order to share resources or what have you with far less religious influence historically marriage is about finances so the modern government decided that they could use this belieftradition and give a kickback to couples who were married in the hopes that they would better provide a stable upbringing for their expected children ultimately resulting in a better generation of americans that would continue the trend of prosperity for this country the government was literally investing in babies even at the time of all this the counterargument was what about couples who dont have kids and the overwhelming response was well thats a reasonable risk that rarely happened the good far outweighed the bad however now with the dissolution of tradition and the preexisting knowledge that a couple is completely incapable of producing children it is only right to say no you cant get married to them you cannot reap these benefits if you adopt then you will get those benefits as if you produced a child and then some as if you were married because we want the next generation to be raised in a stable environment but no apparently thats not good enough it isnt the governments fault that you cant visit your injured spouse in the hospital thats the hospitals fault its not the governments fault that your insurance provider wont honor you and your significant other under a singular policy thats the insurance companys fault reaching out to big daddy government for every trivial matter just brings us closer and closer to total government control you cant take care of yourselves so the government has to people have been surrendering control of their own lives for decades and were fast approaching the tipping point if you think its bad now that cops can kill an armed suspect regardless of threat level just wait until the police are summarily executing people for misdemeanors you keep getting the government involved its going to get worse and worse that yellow brick road the government is promising you always leads to poverty and police state do you truly believe our government can fulfill these promises the germans thought they were getting something better equality by voting for hitler the italians thought they were getting something better equality by voting for mussolini they already had equality but they got sold on socialism and fascism do you really want to go down that road even though weve already seen it fail terribly do you not see that this is the road democrats are marching down our government should abandon marriage entirely in my opinion no one should get a civil marriage no one should get these benefits anymore at least until we can sort out an appropriate use for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because liberal white people think the black vote belongs to them because liberal whites just care so much about black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stfu you not white stop writing like youre white black pride nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump with his racist pandering incorrect

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people too busy thinkin bout the next place theys gonna rob ayyyyyyy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea she did take responsibility years after the fact and only because the black lives matter movement basically pressured her for an apology i never said she hated black people but she described the youth gangs arguably black youths in these communities as less than human at the time by calling them super predators which makes it a racist remark even if she didnt intend it to come out like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because black people arent allowed to have free will and do what they want they have to support the agenda of the black community s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a black person constantly being confused for a white person on bpt i think i should represent their delegation

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is just decentmemecom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know those arent real right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no seriously that pbj looks good enough to lacquer and store for eternity most of the peanut butter jelly sandwiches look about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so this arab is brown this indian is brown this thailand is brown and this american is white you do realize that skin tone alone isnt indicative of race and most certainly cannot be used to describe a continent as diverse as asia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes probably gonna turn this into a feminist case because other officers that have murdered black people were men cunt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whaaaaa a woman in power versus a dead black guy who will the left champion this time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not arguing with your point but in the pic he says what nation you stole me from so hes lumping all white people into one group and not considering your point concerning separate cultures my ancestors came to the us after slavery ended and had nothing to do with any segregation much less myself yet i still get flack for being white i just wish everybody could get off this race war shit both sides give it a few more generations old ideology dies in time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people didnt steal anyone they purchased them fair and square from other africans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rcringepics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,than why would you say it if even a small response will insult you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because white people are inferior right thats what the post is getting on about when did this sub stop being funny and get so racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stahhhhppp
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats about it honestly weve been a crew for a very long time so it doesnt get initiated we just kind of join up if that makes sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rnocontext
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone making a my white friend joke doesnt actually have any white friends this would be like someone saying my black friend does nothing but eat chicken watermelon talk at the movies and is never on time the posts on this subreddit dont reflect a typical black person just like a post on tumblrinaction doesnt reflect a typical girl if someone makes a joke and laughs you can laugh too if someone says you cant laugh because youre not gay a certain race or whatever else special snowflake criteria theyre just being assholes and at least now you know to stay away from that person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dem titties tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not its just dudes fapping to porn we just happen to be in the same living room
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly nothing gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aggressive af lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,here is a real answer just avoid blacks as you can see they try to start shit with people who even try to be friends with them theyre an extremely insecure low intelligence underclass in the united states that will go out of their way to try and start shit most other races know this as an unspoken rule so we all pretty much do the same thing to deal with them treat them as you would a spoiled over emotional child but dont let them know youre doing it just avoid them and youll be fine this sub is filled with a bunch of white boys trying to play black because they hate themselves but actual blacks arent people youd really want to associate with maybe arent terrible people hypocritical double standards dont register to them as evidenced by this post dont be afraid to be racist in your thoughts and actions whites that try to act like race doesnt exist put themselves at a disadvantage because blacks are about the most racist individuals in this country no matter how good you get in with them youll never be one of them you shouldnt want to be anyways self hating losers are the only ones that try to mimic them if you do have to fight one of them then watch out for sucker punches and pack attacks one on one theyre actually very easy to take down just be ready for them to cry racism when they get their ass kicked

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this the white version of black people vs niggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is a white right of passage similar to black children seeing their father for the first time after they get arrested
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all you post about is white people and then you lock the thread when you get called out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why white people like they food so rare
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if this was a muslim i can only imagine the reaction from certain folks not yall though youre cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpimgurcomxcxsrbz

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yer gunna wish u did when killary cuntlon wins
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a father doing things with his child news to ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this goes all the way back to native americans and the spirit of the deer but i suppose black people dont really know much about tradition i mean unless you count running from the police or neglecting your children and now i sit back and wait for my inevitable ban tyronesosalty doublestandard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are no black people on this sub only year old white kids so dont worry
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its uh actually a native american thing but u know dont study ya history or anything it good

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he said if something which i took to mean as an animal which eat us whenever they can totally resonable response guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how is this even funny rule posts must be showcasing somebody being hilarious on social media writing white people wyd is hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spending time with their fathers i know its weird to think about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,over a dumbass comment in a sub dedicated to socalled socially acceptingprogressive people stereotyping black cultrebut of course not in a rniggers type of way why would i even waste my time id rather save my tears for the joyous moment when whites quit watching and befriend an actual black person or interact in a black community not listen to rap with their friends in the burbs drive through the ghetto once every weeks and conjure up some false image of black culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in fact youre more likely to change their mind if you keep cool the chances of anyone you correct on reddit changing their mind are literally close to zero its better to humiliate them in a mean way so others join in because people like to bully in the hopes that they just delete their retarded reply and are too ashamed to post it again

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,think of it like the white people version of sending one of your look outs to pop a stranger to see if she is worthy of more responsibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a white person i never understood the mentality of hunting or generalizing an entire race because you saw a satirical fb post of a little girl eating a deer heart this tweet isnt funny its fucking stupid and i wonder how my tweet would go over if i posted a picture of a little black boy eating chitlins with a caption that reads black ppl wyd if you want to be real about it both hearts and intestines are organs this shit is racist and dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit like this is crazy to black folk spending time with your father whats that

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when you repeatedly refuse to address anything ive said and instead say muh oppression in the system over and over i have no choice but to rub in how horrible your dbate skills are if i had opened with ur wrong im rite you would have a point but i didnt look at average income of chinese average unemployment compare it to black average income slaves being paid enough to eat to get around the slavery loophole and they arent in the same cultural vortex of fatherless children and welfare as american blacks i have nothing against any race but it doesnt do anyone a service to lie about reality and pretend you have it hard it just gives people an excuse to leech and give up dont make excuses promote academics even though they arent cool glorify scientists and businessmen not ball players and rappers i dont know its a complex problem but it absolutely at this point in time is not being perpetuated by anything but black culture and black people themselves

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,here in toronto theyre overtly racist and divisive until the last day or two theyd refused to even talk to the mayor about their concerns its about race shaming whites and and showing anger without wanting to be constuctive in any way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf is this nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wrong hood nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree both halves need to be involved in child rearing that being said biologically ie through millennia of adaptation and evolution women tend to be attracted to and choose a mate based on his perceived ability to provide in some capacity this is why generally speaking women tend to marry up on the social ladder of society they want to feel cared for if everything is gonna be equal on all fronts then whats the incentive to marry why not just get a sperm donor and raise the child with a committed buddy or roommate i didnt make these rules biology did you shouldnt have to feel like youre carrying our partner through life so again i repeat this doesnt mean women cant have fulfilling careers but something in terms of priority will have to give to have a stable and happy family situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,umglln mate you can come up with a better title than that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,triggering
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a white person i feel that blm are racist tell me i am wrong i cant argue with blacks saying were racist if thats how they feel i cant prove to them i am not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this nigga really broke his own rules
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf of the people on this sub are white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,square up my nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no you are sevenelevening that ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white couples taking their bulls on dates now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,let me say as ive always said and i will always continue to say that riots are socially destructive and selfdefeating im still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice i feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve that in a real sense it is impracticable for the negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the united states so i will continue to condemn riots and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way and continue to affirm that there is another way but at the same time it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots i think america must see that riots do not develop out of thin air certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots but in the final analysis a riot is the language of the unheard and what is it that america has failed to hear it has failed to hear that the plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last few years it has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met and it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice equality and humanity and so in a real sense our nations summers of riots are caused by our nations winters of delay and as long as america postpones justice we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention also martin luther king jr you know whats tiresome hearing people misquote mlk to justify rioting and then when someone rightfully points out that rioting doesnt help anybody neither does looting or violence they pull out this quote about white people devoted to order over justice conveniently alluding to a false dichtomy in which one is either on the side of justice and must condone all actions taken in the name of that justice or they are a do nothing moderate or worse an oppressor no one who speaks out against rioting and looting and murdering police are saying that black americans must stop protesting or that they do not have legitimate grievances or that things are fine you can be for justice against brutality and racism and violence and also be against rioting and brutality and violence as retaliation doctor king would never in a million years advocate such violence but he understood such violence he understood where it came from he understood why it happens but he never not even for a moment agreed with it he never stopped opposing it he never stopped until his dying day speaking out against all forms of violence and to then use his name to try to silence and discredit those who try to remind us that rioting is not the same as protesting and violence only begets more violence as do nothing moderates at best oppressors and racists at worst is the very height of hypocrisy rioting only weakens the cause of justice by giving those very oppressors reason to say that they are under attack those who kill police justify then the killing by police by showing they have reason to be frightened and worry for their lives to say they are in danger and it blurs the line between protestor and rioter allowing both to be discredited by racists and oppressors in a single breath it is not wrong to not want to demonize rioters but it is most definitely wrong to glorify them or to even justify their actions and not decry them murdering police even in the name of justice is wrong rioting even in the name of justice is wrong looting even in the name of justice is wrong there are other ways there are better ways of protest and those who cant stand protest who are uncomfortable with the truth being laid to bare before their eyes will still decry peaceful protests like the kneeling during the national anthem the raising a gloved fist on a podium acts of solidarity protest marches in peace and candlelight vigils rallies and sit ins are all still valid forms of protest no matter what the old racist white lady or the uncomfortable suburbanite jingoistic middle class white family saysthe line is clear the right path is clear and there is no excuse for ignoring history and doing violence and harm to your own cause and then cherry picking words from a speech fundamentally against violence and rioting to justify your acts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,election ended last year you can get over it now 👋🏻
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,grammar doesnt cost anything

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,typical vegan pussy who gives a shit what another person eatsyou sound like an angry hipster bitch enjoy your tasteless beans and vegetables
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when and where fgt ill beat your ass and suck your dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,apples and oranges youre comparing murdering someone to farming also murder is kind of illegal whereas farming isnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can still get the pipe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck trump but he my nigga itll be different to see him in office hopefully he doesnt fuck up cause its still our country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i honestly really dont care if some of my taxes end up paying for some guy to sell his food stamps to get some jordans the fact that hes willing to forgo having a prideful job and living a comfortable lifestyle in order to apply for welfare and use some for a pair of sneakers really makes me feel sad for people like that people like that live in dirty subsidized housing and have substandard education for their children i dont envy them at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as long as were generalizing entire races of people and acting out tribalism based on skin shade identity racism will never go away were all individuals born as humans in a reality we dont understand at the end of the day we waste too much life on petty things smash that mf like button if you agree 😞
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not even funny tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not possible at least one of them gets a new face every weeks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a poor white man grew up waay below the poverty line and with a single mom i recognize that i had it better than people of color and women who had my same circumstances but i believe that people of these other groups have more privilege than i do if they had the luck of growing up outside of poverty if i am wrong correct me but i believe economic class is the bedrock of privilege and that color and gender advantages are built up on top of this foundation yet class is never in the discussion other than the assumption that poc are poorer economically which is statically probable but also does not take into account rural whites like myself who come from poor white areas i live in a black urban neighborhood now and relate to my friends and neighbors and also see very real poverty and violence in the black community that needs to be fixed i believe that the problems of poor blacks and poor whites and poor asians latinos and everyone need to be fixed through cooperation and understanding but here is where i get touchy on the subject of privilege the people who confront me on white male privilege are virtually always white females from affluent backgrounds or black berkeley students bay area who i assume come from more stable households than myself i really want to have this conversation seriously because i think its important for our society but is white male privilege so strong that even a rich woman or poc have less privilege than myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all my friends are heathens take it slow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,odd how you think the blm kidnap pings were just an excuse to push a political agenda
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit and ill still fuck with smart guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nsfw
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh just get your dumb ass outta here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bull semen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wifed up how can she bet on the next best thing if she decides on a nigga that might not be the next best thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your mental delusions hurt quite a lot even watching but ill get over it unfortunately unlike you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,attention all rappers your political opinions are dogshit to everyone who isnt you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same its literally like claim me and ill be tolerable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sounds like you didnt get enough oxygen at birth thats cool though bro stay mad thats a dope way to live life too i guess not for me but you do you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cant lie that was extremely corny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you dont like fried chicken you can get the fuck out of america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,depends what question he ax you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spent damn there her whole adult life in politics and still couldnt get shit done at least give ol boy a chance😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to respond to your point trump has an even worse track record as a person what has hillary done thats so abhorrent besides being cheated on by her husband honestly a lot of peoples objections to her are based entirely on their feelings not facts feelings are important but not when making such an important decision
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you plugged in by chance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so speaking proper is white speaking voice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more than blacks as well my dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot of white people associate the black accent with a lack of intelligence its sad when i see white people praising a black person for being well spoken or intelligent when in reality they just speak like a stereo typical white person these people are so stuck in their own prejudice that just because somebody pronounces a word differently they consider them less intelligent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga you at work right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so well spoken for someone named laquisha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white voice you mean clear english
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so whiteface isnt racist but blackface is im just trying to understand the rules here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly curious is american ghetto culture really so bad that its so common for people to cheat on eachothet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems like youre the one making those assumptions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck meritocracy we need diversity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its basically a symptom of a lack of education and gang culture blacks that sound like that are usually poorer and products of bad public schooling and rap influences normally the more educated the person the less slang the person uses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that seems kinda discriminatory towards white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop appropriating our voices xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt segregation end in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont save her she dont wanna be saved
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah the bigotry of low expectations why dont you hunt white candidates i feel that having ethnic quotas completely defeats the purpose of meritocracy id rather have gay disabled hawaiian lawyers who are the best at doing what they do over a diverse mediocre lawyer squad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate when people call me bud such douchey pseudo subtle way of being condescending to someone without openly insulting them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no one is telling people where to live cultural segregation is a choice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he isnt wrong being outraged over a factual statement of an event that has a chance of actually happening is silly nu uh we would totally whip you ok cool but its still not happening
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because shes a man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,key word innocent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,calls us racists assuming were white religious and republicans you only got one right on me boy im white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,republicans hahahahahahahahahahaha you know what happens when you assume right you look like a fucking retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i curious as to what you would consider urban spech if someone comes in an interview with you and they mane cuz and have that low mumble voice theyre more likely to get the position
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe they were hired because of diversity requirements and didnt get job offers because they werent held to the same standards as everyone else and were shit lawyers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre the one professing a correct opinion on the subject why dont you share it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,encouragment isnt enforcement i dont accept that in segregation still affects anything in any meaningful way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats the fuck boi haircut easily
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,smh tbh fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looks like a butch mariah carey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,glad to see how confident you are with your opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im pretty sure im right you are the one that is retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is one of those haircuts thats already dated i can picture everyone ten years from now looking back and laughing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,got obama twice too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clownlivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rpunchablefaces
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people arent just being gunned down at random by cops to think so is dangerous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if the clown trains a gun on us and resists arrest can we shoot it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i get the point op is trying to make but this is a weak argument the loudest voices are often the idiotsjust loud enough to sound out the intellegent people making a good argumentbut all we can really hear is nonsense
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair cops dont want to shoot innocent people they just want all minorities to be guilty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair few black people shot are innocent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no organized police forces exist for the sole reason of suppressing minorities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clown lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unbelievable youre head is so far up your ass you assumed it was more likely that i didnt know how to use quotation marks instead of considering the possibility that maybe this was an actual quote you hadnt heard idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that i know i could beat up is this true i wish someone would try something like that with me without having set foot on the mat people are so arrogant nowadays and willing to get in fights without have any idea if that person trains jiu jitsu or some shit i wish people would watch before getting into fights be safe guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,says the wigger
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as long as the clown is not resisting not being combative and obeying police orders what
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mandingo train
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do what the cop says dont resist arrest or run from the police dont carry a firearm if youre not legally allowed to do so felons arent allowed to possess any firearms l and surprise police shootings will drop precipitously
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clownlivessplatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no if they tell you to hold your hands up and you reach for your pocket you should get shot thats what happened in most of these cases plain old suicide by cop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is one incident i can think of the guy who was taking care of an autistic child the rest were thugs not putting their hands up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were still pretending innocent black people are getting systematically shot sure dress as a clown then its very fitting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,am i the only one not seeing the secret to not getting shot by police here if you are black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive never been in a locked thread zips up lets go boys we in here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clowns are not responsible for half of the murders despite being less than of the population
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,innocent being the key word dressing up as a clown aint illegal on the other hand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my face when the check dont go through
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clownlivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just getting banned 卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐卐
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so they spared a few white people big deal you gotta look at the rest of the picture of course apprehending a white person is less threatening at least to anybody who reads statistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,daily reminder aas commit over half of all homicides every year this had been a fun fact of the day text racist whiteboy 😂😂👌👌 to this number to stop fun facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but if black commit of the crimes as of the population what is so weird about them being killed more often by cops i think that is his point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are approximately people killed by the police each year what percentage of those people do you think were not armed at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of all the recent shootings maybe two werent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,every time i read a black man is killed by cop i look for video and usually its a dude cussing at police resisting and reaching for something while not denying the obvious issues discussed everyone right now i am completely disinterested in the actual shootings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clownlivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were losing focus of the original point which was that black people should have the same privilege of having a statement issued by police on their behalf and that they shouldnt be killed because like with the clowns you wouldnt want to accidentally shoot an innocent person but really isnt that redundant people dont randomly kill black people because theyre scared of themmost anyway meanwhile clowns are very rare and people are irrationally scared of clowns its weird because committing a crime shouldnt result in a killing a death should be a result from lives at danger a last resort i highly doubt these crimes were all putting lives in danger i think these crimes were often a biproduct of the environment many black people live in i think it is a side effect of not being wealthy and facing the struggles of poverty thus applicable to any race i dont see your point here if you resist arrest andor dont obey the polices orders and behave suspiciously chances are high you will be shot and killed thats the reality the safety of the police goes before the safety of the criminal its weird because not every black person is a criminal most are not criminals therefore they shouldnt be treated like criminals criminals should be treated like criminals how exactly are black people treated like criminals its weird because innocent black people are killed by authority and law enforcement and though those killed may not be confined to only black people it still happens often how often are they innocent im not talking unarmed im talking innocent how often does that actually happen i can think of like cases in the last couple years but of course i have no actual numbers black people shouldnt be killed for being black the only black people that may have to be killed are those that are putting someone elses life in danger and there is no other choice but to shoot which should be an extreme and applicable to every race are they though could you back that claim up its weird because african americans still deserve the rights of every other american but very often do not receive the benefits of these rights such as having the right to carry a firearm in various states instead exercising some of these rights get some black people killed this may not happen all the time but it happens enough that it has become a problem prominent right now source on that being an actual problemblacks being killed for carrying firearm in certain states
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck white people am i right s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol real funny gramps xd savage af nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are the clowns carrying weapons and known for committing crime case closed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes you can grab their tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so do the blacks when you shoot them for pointing a gun at you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so whites after the only ones who can be racist none of those people could have been hispanic asian
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kill and rape and drink the grape
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,after hearing your voice i see why real niggas are getting banned from this fucking minstrel show
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because black peoples parents are almost nonexistent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well i mean dont clowns usually put so basically dress up in white face and youre innocent but then scary but be your normal black self and youre scary but then innocent i mean at least theyre constant with their logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,such bullshit black people are so salty when it comes to this but they completely look past how innately violent a lot of them are and how they almost always are the aggrevators towards the police i am afterall in a mainly black or whites trying to be black sub so this ignorance is expected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,glad to see yall nappy headed assholes support a racist terrorist organization
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae white people are the worst

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit nigga you at least
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,says the afro latina feminist giving redditors advice on how to score drugs abroad while simultaneously calling them neckbeards in other subs thanks for proving my point about american women being a waste of time lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was a good boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are we going so far as to say users are being offensive for using the word retard colloquially and not in reference to a mentally challenged individual even so should that get them indiscriminately banned from subs hell meirl has been banning people for participating in subs theyve decided they dont like even if the content is completely benign is that right in your opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well in my opinion thats absurd do you mind telling me the reasoning behind yours
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my nigga harambe had a fire mixtape aswell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your face when you smash raw dot then it burns when you pee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rcoontown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do they also ban srs users
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im comforted by the fact that even if theyll live on their parents money their whole life theyll be completely helpless for as long as they live and never get the satisfaction boost and selfesteem you get when you manage to take care of something by yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,monkey jesus whyyyyy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she can feel the burn

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,choosing between a douche and a giant turd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its just president what happens in the oval office stays in the oval office unless you get your dick sucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not with that attitude you cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol now youre just pulling shit out of your ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i kinda hated the fact hillary or the fucking moderator even bothered bringing up obama shit hillary was disrespectful to obama and so was trump more important he aint fucking runnin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she was reading prepared statements i think trump just winged it which is actually bad for hillary and good for him for debates
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahaha the election process is only the beginning of the shitshow my friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not me couldnt be happier that the majority of americans are making the right choice to maga as a former black liberal i was skeptical of trump at the beginning but i honestly believe if you read his policies and didnt rely on preconceived notions youd realise he is a great choice for the future of jobs and a safer country and if you think im trolling dont just take it from me take it from the millions of americans who understand the last thing we need is another politician in office after all thats what brought us here in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you think hillary wouldnt want that hillary is an authoritarian through and through
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how big do you think is when will people start rejecting the bs racism accusations and realize that the majority of americans are sick of corruption and political correctness
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but mostly trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alright talk to me then man why am i a dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to shreds you say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,percent im not supporting him but someone needs to give me some evidence hes racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,either trump or clinton will die in office trump will get assassinated or hillary will die of health issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because enough nontrustworthy girls always zebras im done with this meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more the corruption and brutal needless wars around the globe how many more people have to die for hillarys piggy bank
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well this is a little ranty but he said that he wants them to protect japan and south korea since right now were doing it we cannot keep our current record of bases around the world us as the world police they need their own militaries in the future with those military programs that might mean they get nukes and thats truly not the end of the world sk and japan are modernized eastern counties donald wants to leave no options off the table for negotiations if he can get nk or china to play ball by threatening this its a good tactic and nuclear weaponry specifically the threat of nuclear weaponry has unilaterally made the world safer its prevented neighboring countries from invading israel its stopped the cold war from turning into world war sk a responsible civilized nation and great ally having nuclear weapons only helps stabilize the region and improve their defense against china and north korea it will happen if japan continues to spend less than of gdp on military and they expect us to go to war against china or north korea for them good luck with that if they have to make nukes since they are so scared then thats too bad but we cant keep shouldering the burden
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and hillary is the democrat yes over million americans and this is what we are left with tweedle dumb or tweedle dumber
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why would i lie about my race what purpose would that serve me you may not agree with me but assuming im lying is idiotic and what rhetoric would that be that he has more nonwhite women executives working for him than almost anybody else that he helped victims of the louisiana floods despite hillary staying behind that he supports the idea of easier legal immigration to encourage good people to come to america and be citizens i find it hard to argue that to be antiblack rhetoric now i will agree that his temper is possibly his greatest issue but i will go as far to say that its his passion to make america great again and it must be upsetting to see politicians attempt to ruin this country time and time again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wouldnt expect a black person to understand any level of political discourse tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats pretty discriminatory to imply that and say one is better than the other for minorities one called african american males super predators fyi and the other did not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why cuz you familia cant figure out how to legally immigrate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so hillary the one who supported her husbands crime bill that destroyed minority communities the same time she called young black men super predators that needed to be brought to heel
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,states like new york who have implemented stop and frisk have been shown to be very effective in crime prevention if you ask me cities like chicago would benefit greatly from it considering there were over deaths there since january and if youre going to make the argument that it encourages racial profiling why would it police officers that were corrupt before were already pulling racially profiled searches but with this plan it will allow normal lawabiding police officers to help prevent potential crime in areas with high death rates by illegal firearms or manufacturing selling of drugs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and hillary is the democratic nominee we are fucked either way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ctr rolling deep all across reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont bother these people are as far left as you can get
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am literally cryin in tears right now fam this cannot be real this cannot b happnein dis trump pres mean thats i got to actually use my timberlands boots to get a job when trump brings them all back from china ans mexico yo smh i am literally crying right now thinking the obama free ride handout is going to end i actually have to work and get a job like white people do dis is cray cray yo smh

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im so upset we have to chose between a criminal and a sociopath and its close
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its not youre either unintelligent or a misogynist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mate youre a teenager whose parents dont let you watch south park literally just checked your post history dont even try to pretend you have experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how come hillary can have been against gay marriage many years ago but now its played off as she genuinely changed her position on it yet when trump says one thing years ago and says another now its holy shit what a fucking hypocrite lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary can suck my cock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bernie was on board with the lgbtq community from day one thats why it matters not to mention superpreadtors and all of her other gaffs also it hardly matters if she said it once or a million times they were her personal feelings on homosexuality just like trumps feelings on climate change changed they are comparablenon caps lock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,her plans are a joke if under barry as secstate she did so poorly even if you totally ignore the whole emailgate and foundation and paytoplay scandal she intend to do tpp i suggest you read up the draft version to know what that implications are years under democrat barry and his entire strategy is lets borrow more from china barry borrowed more than the entire usa past presidents combined go to trump site and read thru his policies if hillary at this point cant even state her policies as detailed as barrys whom are even less detail than trump im not sure what is her plans are other than promises i got a lot of those hopeless unfulfilled promises from barry i dont need it more from her come nov we will see the right leadership many countries now are ditching barry and starts negotiating with trump or factoring him in their plans just look at how barry got snubbed at china and you want a frail woman to negotiate with xi putin kim and ayatollah even mexican president had meetup with trump and then there is kaine seriously viting her is like saying kaine will be great president after her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mayyybe i care about he complete disregard for national security and being more concerned with super predators than her husband
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you dont have to vote for a criminal to do your part ☺️
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but trump isnt blaming god damn foreigners hes blaming politicians he understand why everyone does what they do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont understand why youre being downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were you alive from would have blown your mind im assuming you hate kanye west
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dis white person cray posting about black people wanting jobs dees timberlands aint fo doing dat white people shit ans working yo smh dis white people make me laugh yo fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i weep for the black community every single night seeing blacks murder other blacks in chicago since king hussein obama took the throne
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it makes no sense the democrats have done nothing substantial to help innercity minorities in the past ten years even with a black president donald trump was absolutely correct even when factchecked that obamas recovery from the economy is the worst one this country has ever seen trump wants to build infrastructure put money into businesses to create jobs but hey a vote for hillary ensures they can just keep getting by on welfare and food stamps and the economy can still stagnate her political party and the dem administration has shown they are absolutely useless in establishing social progress just look at this country now and tell me obama has made any strides for troubled innercity youths or gang culture were all just fanning the race war flames and obama has clearly shown zero cooperation or respect to law enforcement in america no wonder the police are fucking fed up its a cycle of poverty the democrats are doing n o t h i n g about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mr trump ets talk about literally ever issue the media has perpetuated that you have for the next hour mrs clinton please tell us how much of a sweetheart you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course you would never discuss the blacks murdered by other blacks in the city of chicago since obama has been president but you will have national outrage at lil boosey the three time felon getting high carrying a gun while waiting to drive his child around drugged up out of his mind getting shot by a black cop under a black police chief for being so high he didnt know what was happening and pointing a gun at the cops stay classy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he doubled unemployment ratings for african americans but hes totally lit fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white privilege isnt real
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol someone has different opinion and you quick to label em but i dont see how her plan to create more small business and raising minimum wage to would work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thank you for ¢orrecting the record cents have been deposited into your account
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or die
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you blame trump for trying to bring up other topics look at lesters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not that black and white lester tried to fact check trump on the stop and frisk constitutionality and trump one judge ruled it unconstitutional on a county court and she was thrown off the case someone brought this up earlier but if you declare a law unconstitutional based on one county judge then every lawyer has to go back and take the bar exam again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol strawman argument but then again i dont expect much more from a racist like yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is what i dont understand as a non american even if id share all his views id have a big problem voting for a man who is so weird and cringy i havent yet found a explanation why he is so popular despite this there are other more representable xenophobic conservative racists arround why trump trump has a lot of money to buy advertising and keep himself in the public eye he is also good at appealing to general public racists and xenophobes in a way that a lot of racists and xenophobes arent although a lot of the things he says are clumsy and stupid hes good at catchphrases and soundbites and he is great at evading criticism people criticize him but nothing sticks to him he just plows on through everything i have been thinking for a while now that progressives should adopt this strategy but use it for good speak bluntly and in sound bites but say sensible things when your opponent lies call them a fucking liar call out the shitty things about them and be brutal about it make fun of them mock them i think if bernie sanders had been less polite and more blunt about the shittiness of hillary clinton we would have had a different outcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it must be fucking hard to be that stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can one dude get so many ls that it becomes a w maybe but this motherfucker sure didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,p a i d s h i l l a i d s h i l l
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he flubbed on saying it but he was talking about people that were recently wrongly granted citizenship when they were supposed to be deported
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah yeah guess it was something he intended to say earlier but tried to slip it in to the final question
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre projecting your racism when you think a random photo of a black guy is racist sick fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean cnn and time warner have given hillary millions of dollars did you expect them to be impartial
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont know why the photos fucking there im not the artist but i dont see racism anytime i see a black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats absolutely a fair point but hillarys said some bullshit too only calling out one person on their bullshit implies a bias
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no lester is just a cuckold
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,life must be tough if you cant even look at a picture of a black guy without getting triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because she would never deviate from her script she wouldnt have anything to say if she did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when the mod asked if trump was gonna blame hillary for everything and he said why not i fuckin died i do prefer him big league over her tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or maybe his answer to that question was to make america great again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heavy arms vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alright im not a fan of trump but this is the dumbest comment ive ever read theres no conceivable way hed possibly make slavery legal and lwd with a death penalty these comments for every candidate that are so fucking over the top its borderline an onion article need to stop

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im lowkey hoping for hillary to stroke out so we can have bernie back does that make me a terrible person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what do you mean you guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats cause a huge percentage of blackpeopletwitter subscribers are actually year old white guys who listen to a couple rap albums and think they know what it means to be notwhite in america

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was like watching an elderly couple trying to decide where to go for dinner on their biannual date night and then get sidetracked arguing about shit that happened years ago the wife acting like the victim the entire time and taking shit which the husband had said completely out of context
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahaha get the fuck out of here ctr shill do some reading im not arguing with you over what their emails plainly stated

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or not all cops like wtf lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you sold yourselves into slavery i mean i mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when i became black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i didnt know there were black neckbeards this is a strange crossover between two of my favorite subreddits interesting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meanwhile notallmuslims lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how are they not comparable just curious one is someone we have to trust for enforcing laws and while there are a few fuckups we need them to have a proper society the other is a religion which treats women like shit and believes stoning people to death is acceptable if their god says so why are we treating the cops worse or even equal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre retarded they wouldnt be allowed on stage at a miss usa pageant if they werent a
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its most likely just the manipulative ways of the media but ive seen plenty newspolls that say at least of muslims agree with imposing sharia law in america that is something i think is completely unacceptable sharia law is oppressive bigoted and all around a terrible thing is if these statistics are right that is way too many extremists i dont know how socially active people are even accepting of it its an ideology and a choice of religion you arent born a muslim you can be forced by your parents when youre a child yes but once youre an adult it is completely by choice i believe you are born with your sexual orientation but not your religion muslims choose to be muslim cops choose to be cops cops are enforcing the law to keep citizens safe there are crazy cops but theyre obviously not all crazy people saying not all cops isnt meant to shut down young peoples fear of authority its rather to remind them not to get ahead of themselves and get to the point where they think they should remove cops entirely youd be surprised fear of authority is acceptable i completely agree with putting body cams on all cops i completely agree with arresting cops who abuse their powers i do not agree with the kind of shit im seeing in the media today teens beating up cop cars flipping off cops trying to pick fights etc disrespecting authority is going to throw this country down the drain
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just offer them a foot rub then when her feet are in your lap maneuver her feet so that she can feel your erection and massage your penis with her feet works best if youre wearing gym shorts ive used this method to get plenty of throughthepants footjobs from strippers

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do you like mens nails to look
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,daaammnn google back at it again with the white vans privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shh that doesnt fit the narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she refused to support gay marriage until like the timing of this revelation is perfectly timed for her political career the video above is from when clinton was a senator in it she says i believe marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman she lead the charge against stopping gay marriage she wasnt just neutral on it she was completely against she say whatever she has to to get votes she doesnt give a fuck about anything but getting more power whereas sanders has been a loud supporter of it for years and years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he doesnt know his history either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that would feel like fucking a child tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is still plenty of discrimination against minorites alive today no there isnt it maybe exists in pockets at the local level but that will end when the boomers die there is no need for affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody was saying that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah or you know how about not committing any crime pretty sure people dont go around locking blacks up or shooting them just because
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how come posts talking shit about white people get upvoted all the time and its not salty but when people point it out they are salty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its like all you people think that actual issues backed up by facts is racist black on black crime has killed more blacks nowadays then anything else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,certain blacks being against mixing is more about preserving black american heritage and culture because they dont want it lost or diluted through mixing so white people dont have culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae trump is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you name one racist statement of his
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so you like men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,citation needed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anything else that says hes racist or was that all you had
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im saying that calling a uber for one nighter is not as bad as others were making it out to be as some women will linger if you allow them to stay this is purely anecdotal of course yet im being downvoted by white knights or insecure women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i feel so bad being white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont have a problem with men liking men what i do have a problem with is gay men critiquing other men the only man a gay man should be concerned about is his own man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uhhhh picture one has two pics of trayvon martin and a couple of mug shots picture two has mug shot and two white girls in blackface not as bad as three but still a far cry from all white teenagers are stock images
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,any race can say nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well then stop being worried about me and look after your own man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well its rblackpeopletwitter basically a sub full of degenerates
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mods stickied a post would obviously cause race arguments in the comments can i ask why lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe its just google displaying its most indexed images not everything is racist especially crime statistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hoo boy this one looks fun trumps comments about latinos he called latino immigrants criminals and rapists he was referring to illegal immigrants not immigrants in general and not once did he specify latino immigration just immigration across the mexican border not racist he said mexicans and other immigrants were killers too see he insisted the mexican government intentionally sends their criminals to the us how is this racist against latinos in any way he provided evidence that latino immigrants were rapists see he took a jab at jeb bush over his mexicanborn wife this would be a lot more compelling if it was something he actually said instead of a joke he retweeted from a supporter he brought up jeb bushs wife again less than two months later see he said his followers were passionate after being told two men beat a hispanic man in his name ive searched around but i cant seem to find any source of him saying this considering the fact that he later disavowed the beating im going to go ahead and call this alleged statement out as a hoax as for the beatings the men were just criminals using trump as an excuse he kicked jorge ramos out of a press conference jorge was speaking out of line he blamed blacks and hispanics for violent crime across the country this is a tough subject but in the end all he was doing was stating statistics ill edit the others in when i get the chance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are exactly what i expected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre not exclusively heterosexual take care
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right reporting on crime is the problem not committing them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reddit errors were popping up so i assumed it didnt go through
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hush now that doesnt fit the one sided foolish arguments nobody wants to hear about equality amongst races
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,deadass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so youre still voting for hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is so damn scripted why do mods have the ability to pin comments that a regular commenter would makepost
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,proof was given in reply to your comment where the fuck is your reply to that comment might as well just admit that you fucked up and admit it turns out he is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stickying your own lame comment really
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,with a video that obviously fake cant we just suspend disbelief and enjoy the bit without bitching about how fake it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice lets hope those are actually real and not only allegations nearly half of those could be attributed to hillary clinton as well who has done much much worse in her life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and then months into the relationship she breaks up with you because shes still in love with her ex been there done that fuck that

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you serious people are buying hillarys bullshit her fake sympathy for woman children and minorities are comical and liberal are falling for the act all over the place even when she gets caught in a lie you still find under informed people defending her blindly get real man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the dumbest thing ive seen on reddit ever first of all youre claiming a total of in your title i guess you cant math second this is extremely racist would you want me to identify all black people with corn rows a certain way because thats exactly what youre doing ive never committed on this subreddit and yes im white but does that make my points invalid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah all cops that look like this will do all of the aforementioned things just like a black people will eat your watermelon after theyve stolen it isnt it fun to generalize and buy into stereotypes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,another spicy helping of race bait 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 wew lad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if she do that he gonna get squashed to death
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he makes an ok point calling it black lives matter instead of something like stop police racism or hold police accountable is idiotic if you want to achieve change the campaigns just entrenched both sides on an issue thats very easy to get universal support on its vague like occupy wallstreet or kony allowing the people running the campaigns to be activists indefinitely with no clear agenda instead of including everyone its made borderline racist middle america pick racial war over fight abuse of power by authority as the lesser of two evils
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alright well black people have as much culture as tv show that raised them watch me get downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if it portrays a race negatively it is what are you having trouble with here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,t r u m p lets get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as uidnab pointed out here it really does make sense though he makes an ok point calling it black lives matter instead of something like stop police racism or hold police accountable is idiotic if you want to achieve change the campaigns just entrenched both sides on an issue thats very easy to get universal support on its vague like occupy wallstreet or kony allowing the people running the campaigns to be activists indefinitely with no clear agenda instead of including everyone its made borderline racist middle america pick racial war over fight abuse of power by authority as the lesser of two evils

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ummm shoot him i mean fuck this honor bullshit put the hollow point in his chest and see how much that bulk does for him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so me although as a black person i hate this fucking sub because non blacks are annoying when they obsess over black people music dance and jokes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if it involves race and youre white its racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like to puke in my own asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does everything have to be racist on first read i just assumed that her dad didnt like her going out with dudes unless theres some other details im missing youre kind of jumping to conclusions here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,call me crazy but ill take an inexperienced girl like this over an experienced girl any day of the week unless its a one night stand for one you can safely assume she hasnt had many sexual partnersencounters because no one has trained that out of her yet which leads me to my next point which is you get to train her to do shit exactly how you like it done tell me whats better than that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but you are assuming that our guy here is black and that the father here is white which is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,only white people can be racist so yea anything she does would be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats the reason behind black parents not wanting their children to date white kids ive never heard of it before
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is it racist to assume shes white bc she has a father to blackmail
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the scots are the black people of the uk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of me does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha totally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reddit were you can joke about other races but as soon as your race is joked on you take the high road guess what race reddit consists of the most
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont u mean bompton niggeh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,find someone who is willing to compromise with the fact that you do horrible things isnt that a redditors dream
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fact that you can come on to this sub and call out white racism says a lot yeah it says i have a keyboard and dont give a fuck about downvotes im calling it out but look what its got me also i dont go on rthedonald i dont find the posts amusing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fuck happened to that nigga head
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hi soupdup thanks for submitting to rblackpeopletwitter however your submission has been removed this action was taken because its not a social media post if you disagree with this action you can please include a link to your post so that we can see it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats my problem with blm what about all the people with mental illnesses shot by the police what about the latinos and native americans what about the fact that poor areas have more police violence what about the fact that the second most common police brutality is sexual assault or the fact that yes most people shot by the cops are white black are killed at a higher percentage though we can focus on specifically black people being shot or we can look at the problems at a whole and allow everyone to unite against police violence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh yea i forgot racism only goes one way apparently
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people been banned for less than that this subs skin thinner than the new iphone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you even see your feet lol

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people music and people are wondering why racism still exist its not white people music its called music
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it couldnt be that white people like hiphop too right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if someone tries to tell you youre racist for listening to rap tell them to go fuck themselves and move on with your life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when did anyone say it was racist to be white and listen to hip hop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white cultural appropriation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh i get it because no white people listen to hip hop gotcha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean just check out rhiphopheads im pretty sure we are white guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know its kinda a joke but hip hop isnt black music maybe he was already listening to it because its good not race specific
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racism on so many levels am i wrong aka if youre white therefore you must not listen to black music aka hiphop if youre black you dont know about white music these stereotypes are fine apparently but lets change it to if youre white you must be good at science if youre black you must lack critical thought the thing with stereotypes is whether good or bad theres always exceptions and more to the story
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude youre an asshole based off your post history in this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont start nothing wont be nothing will smith sometime in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know there are actual musicians out there right ones that do crazy things like sing and make melodies not just talk really fast over a bass beat

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,member when bpt was funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if its white to want to stop these dumbasses from protesting rioting and attacking people before trump has even started his term then i guess my black skin deceives me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being president doesnt even really sound that fun the trump family especially that tard eric are gonna be under the public microscope pretty miserable existence

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck this racist shit saying mlk would hate on trumpwhy mlk was killed by this loving government does that fit into your fantasy bubble trump is white and wealthy and is racist right because he says racist stuff like he wants to help the black community becuase they have been getting screwed by the govt foreverhow is that racist fucking stupid is what that is let me ask you folks a simple questionif you can shoot your mouths off and just call all trump supporters white and racist then what do i call my black friends that support trump uncle toms right more stupid another question if a black person is justified in beating a white man for calling him a nggerthen as a white man what is my trigger word if you call me whitey and a crack do i get to act fake offended and assualt that person i am seriously asking a simple question lets see if some one can aswser the question
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets make sure to give that racist twink more coverageright see if we all ignore the stupid racist people then they losecuz they are already losers but we run around giving them attention i know zero racist people racisim is not a everyone but white people thing and standing around talkimg about racist teumpsupporters when trump won the popular vote and electorial college vote in a land slideyou might as well just read from hillary clintons notes and call everyone that disargees with your opinion sexist and racist more stupid shit you want to end this new bs wave of race tensions then stop buying into it and give it zero attention and zero air time same on cnn and the msm for creating this atmosphere blaming trump is the new mass mental illness sorry guys but is actually not up to trump to fix all the problems in the worldits actaully our jobs that is the problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh you smug fuck just shut the fuck up this shit is why we have this bullshit divide in the country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm isnt really either its just so unorganized tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont give a fuck what your race is all i heard was you justifying violence in any form as long as its for your cause or thats its ok because the other side started it thats a fucked up attitude to take and will solve literally nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,really white people dont know shit about history what a broad ignorant and racist statement what if i said black people dont know shit about history see how thats wrong

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uneducated reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,regardless of what the reverend said back in the day there are a lot of people in the blm movement which promote violence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i imagine that mlk would disapprove of the methods blm has used promoting violence at many of their protests and propping up men like al sharpton for example
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think this proves he would have supported black lives matter it proves that he supported radical action in pursuit of civil rights and equality so he likely wouldnt have had any problem with blms methods we dont have much fuel for speculation about what he would have thought of the cause though the opponents of blm not that i am one arent saying that they are going too far in pursuit of a righteous cause theyre saying that their ideology and goals are misguided we cant really assume mlk would have supported their goals just because he was a black civil rights activist there are plenty of black people who were or would have been outraged by the injustices visited upon black people in the mid to late century who would nonetheless disavow the actions and intent of the blm movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah because youre such a great friend oh how you love trying to get any chance to call your friends racist thats what friends are for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he mentioned civil rights emphasis on civil blm is far from civil theyre like the black version of westboro baptist church at this point same old tired message and bullshit delivery that brings everyone down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck this sub nice oneliner dude after he explains why the fuck hillary isnt trustworthy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to the devil have you even heard of the spirit cooking and child abductions and pedophile rings and sacrifices to moloch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i just find it funny how ppl wanted blood thirsty war crimey hillary over trump because he got racists to vote for him thats just that nuc hustler in him he knew how to get elected and hillary didnt trump made al the covert evil come out thats a positive to me i wouldnt wanna hang with him but hes not going to be worse than hillary at least hes going to fix the bridges which obama didnt get to im not mad especially for what hillary and her brother did to haiti we need to stand in solidarity with them and other black nations
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same applies to hillary literally the embodiment of the establishment that fucked us over years ago and wiped thousands of jobs from our country bernie was the chose one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,latinos if they are here illegally what right do they have to stay they shouldve applied for visas if they had legal family members rapeassault victims i support their concern and it is valid blacks that is completely fair but for the record has trump himself said racist things towards blacks coast communities i totally agree with you i hate his stance on climate change i get your concerns dude i really do and thanks for being civil in your post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,illegal immigrants are criminals and should be immediately deported do you not support enforcing the law
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why dont niggers know they are in general far more stupid than everyone else is it a fear of them going ape as usual on us who the fuck cares about that ive personally beaten the dogsnot out of them they are liars just like women who love to kiss their own asses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot of the rich white friends i have are championing this while in and they were sitting in class with attitude because obama won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you purposefully circumvent us immigration laws you are a criminal and shitting out a kid on us soil doesnt change that send em back according to pew research more than in muslims world wide approve of attacks on civilians for political or religious reasons the less of these people we have coming in the better completely agree with trump on the ban so glad leftists have finally been btfo and we can start implementing some policies that make actual sense around here haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i didnt want to get drafted and shot in the fucking face with a because hillary had a hard on for war with russia but fuck that im just a racist shithead right fuck you they types screaming about this bullshit would be the first to claim some kind of disability to get out of the draft needed for a war with a superpower or straight flee to canada but would still pat themselves on the back for progress while men like me died
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tbh half the reason i come here is to collect salt from hillary supporters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rmelaniatrumpnude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its about obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,latinolatinas it is unfortunate that these people will suffer for the crimes of their loved ones nevertheless they are crimes and not to be ignored rapeassault victims the people who voted for trump heya do not believe he was describing assault he was describing being an aggressive celebrity they let you rather clearly indicates consent that his detractors view trump as a rapist is based on them wanting cause to hate him not reality blacks everywhere obama didnt end racism trump didnt start it east coast communities none of them are really at risk within their lifetimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not anymore since trump got in the dow is soaring
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be honest this whole election has made me less optimistic about our future were all on the same side its not us vs them the hatred ive seen on both sides no matter how you try to justify it is just appalling i had faith before i feel worry and uncertainty now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you should get some counselling for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one showing signs of an economic upturn less war poor yoube careful its a big bad scary world out there past your little safe educational facilities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres an important distinction between ignorant and apathetic i would gladly sacrifice the environment if it meant my quality of life improved because im going to be dead by the time its truly awful while im not opposed to environmentallyfriendly changes id like to see us swap to nuclear energy for instance ill never trade a reduced qol now for a better environment in the future
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub does politics so poorly its embarassing stick to the lols
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what exactly is unbelievable about what i said illegal immigrants are always a net negative on any liberal economy if you disagree i suggest you start adopting every stray cat you see from now on no matter how wealthy you are itll eventually break you and my response regarding muslims is based on real data the age of feels over reals is over so you better get used to it bud lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not sure what you mean by this all i advocate for is the enforcement of our immigration laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only thing illegal farm labor does is hurt legal immigrants who end up having to work for less because the labor pool is saturated with undocumented workers making less than minimum wage an increase in the price of poultry and beef is a good thing for us environmentally at this point anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what about all the people who attacked people at trump rallies or the people who just pulled a trump supporter from his car and assaulted him or the rioters trashing stuff and painting antitrump graffiti everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes attractive bro shes underage wtf so am i
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if everyone is special no one is

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,have you been to europe rural areas are completely white cities are white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that level of fear doesnt seem healthy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because they only ride the bikes so that they can put the cool suit on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre white and going through a black neighborhood you dont have to wait for them to call the cops to shoot you theyll do that themselves does anyone actually think a white neighborhood is more dangerous for a black person than the opposite
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah mike brown was a year old kid headed to the library for volunteer work not an lb year old who had just robbed a convenience store and then attacked a cop fracturing his orbital bone lets stop pretending every fucking black kid that gets stopped by cops is some angel

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha totally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,women arent logical accept this now and youll be better off later
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably the bowdlerization of culture is now on the rise again after a period of falling off its very frustrating it used to be that the left was a consistent champion for freedom of expression but i guess now that theyre dominant culturally its not important anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga be looking like et
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sometimes i feel like i need a translator to read these posts

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dear blacks havent you people have had enough of killing each other dont you people deserve some peace to rebuild your cultural image why complain about an innocuous emoji when so many of your people are killed by your own people every single day the late great martin loofah king junior gave us one important message i have a dream that message was not only for civilized people to treat blacks with respect but also for blacks to treat each other with respect why wont you people honor his legacy stop killing each other over petty things its time you people put down your guns and pick up your books and educate yourselves one day you people will truly be able to bring honor to yourselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they dont want to lose their market in the middle east
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats why its confusing that this mod posted it considering hes the type of person who pushes for emoji changes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpsislimgkvcnlqjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats so racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pathetic that the little white man yet has still not embraced diversity send these kkk nazi scum to the reeducation camps immediately
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the racist person says the black family emoji cant exist because there is no dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,try factory resetting it its he same story on android
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair doe the dad would have to be removed for the family pic to be legit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,✈️🏢🏢💥
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i cant tell if people in this sub worship black people or are actively mocking them this is the only thing youve replied to in the entire thread and all you had to say was succ a dicc and youre a moderator you guys are fucking retarded

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,missed this by minutes lmao would now im the one thats lying been a better title
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,beyonce does nothing but pander of course shes with her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i work in a restaurant in an nicer area of alabama and unfortunately the stereotype is true here at least usually only of their tables tip more than
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive been in the service industry for over years in all that time i have only had one black table tip over this doesnt mean when i get sat with some black folks i dont take great care of them but the stereotype has been pretty accurate in my personal experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people dont tip
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a former waiter this single dollar is more than most black dudes leave
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,confirmed black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they do i worked at cheesecake factory for a year the black tables were always the worst asking for tons of extras and demanding to be waited on hand and foot furious if that third side of ranch wasnt there within seconds then theyd always either not tip or leave less than in a busy place like that i have to tip out the bar and the busboys so times when a black tables came in i personally lost money
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt used to be funny as hell i have not checked it for a while but its not nearly as funny as it used to be just a bunch of try hard shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats the thing most ppl understand thats how restaurants work cause its been that way for like a hundred years if you go out to eat tipping is part of the expense if youre cheap or poor then you make excuses and if youre black it doesnt matter youre not tipping regardless
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,perfect sub to post this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats a very popular opinion on reddit but keep pandering for upvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,poor ppl shouldnt come to restaurants if they cant afford a tip should be buying groceries and making their own food
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what language is this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its been the way it is since before your grandparents were born dont act like stiffing a waiter is meant to solve the system if you cant afford it stay home
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive had shitty service from bus drivers but i still expect them to earn money for doing a service this opinion is only held by people that have never worked in the service industry and its as ignorant as it is selfish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alternative rwhitepeopletwitter title when someone ate all of the bagels
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i also was wondering this must be government censorship

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they wrre in the closet to their kids and didnt want their kids to know they were gay they slept in seperate beds too they are bad fathers in my opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in her defense blm has been just fucking themselves over left and right recently roadblocking highways and schools there was a video from a few days ago of a huge crowd running in front of an ambulance with its sirens on and crowded around it so it couldnt leave there wasnt even a roadblock at the time they just saw the ambulance and decided to stop it i wouldnt support them either id support some other anti police brutality protest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did you adopt black kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they sleep in seperate beds and are in the closet to their kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you love this shit

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt somebody just post this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same exact reason these tried to start drama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because we are taught that european features are what is hot this applies to people of color especially in countries where whites are the majority
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love that the mod of this subteddit is reposting stupid shit like the rest of yall keep fuckin up bud
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looking like a wnba power forward

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,michelle a dude though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alright yall this is my last post here im not banned but everyone is asking about the drama why are they having entire threads about me across threads yesterday i made the front page by posting a black guy with a shirt saying if all lives matter stop killing each other i go out to eat with my wife come back and the threads locked but on the front page i posted it just to spark discussion and the top comments explaining that us black people do tons of activism against gang violence and that blm is a separate group i knew somebody would clarify it for the white people who think we dont care about our lives none the less it started a which hunt and im still receiving hate mail somehow people are calling my job some of you know that i do social work in the black community some of you know i have top comments about white privilege some of you even think i hate white people but now and even larger group thinks im an uncle tom i love yall and i appreciate those who liked my account this is getting to realtime to dip
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump talking shit childish first lady talking shit oh lawdy lawdy how amazing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,could not possibly care less its a non issue and not worth discussing hillary stole her last name from a former president thats real plagiarism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so you like dudes 🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but michelle look like a retarded ape no racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not only that the mod of rblackladies and rblackfellas refuses to take the post causing the which hunt down she wonders why i sent proof to the admins instead of her theyellowrose because she hates me always talks bad about me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its amazing how somebody can vilify you when they dont know you they have no idea what ive done for the black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same nigga with the cheeto stained fingers and the acne
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because he didnt get any pokeballs and was expecting pokeballs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because those are michelles kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because it combined topics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because he intends on making sexual advances on his interviewer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because melania plagurized
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because he implies that women who mess with horoscopes arent very intelligent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,careful now buddy you wouldnt wanna be a racist racist with those facts would you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because it implies melania is going to plagiarize the theme song from fresh prince of belair
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,s u c c
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as long as it gets us off the damn kanyetswift jokes i count it as god sent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because melania copied michelles speech
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because she made cups of noodles thinking that she lost the previous cups
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i always upvote antitrump memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because she claims she wrote it herself with some help
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a joke about somebody elses professional victimhood coming from bpt now thats rich
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,savage af dawg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and dont forget parts of michelles speech were also plagiarized from previous first ladies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,difference is he was a candidate not the spouse of one theres a different level of accountability a candidates wife who speaks english as a second language and worked with a speechwriter can hardly be blamed for two sentences that resemble a speech from years ago if anything blame the speechwriter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of the time in the day between am and am what time is it josie its real nigga hours httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama has been accused of the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because people usually dont wear boots in the shower
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because the liver processes alcohol and his did a nice job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humorous because the sign says black republican committee and theres no blacks to be seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she can tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop screwing with the rhetoric there guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its humourous because michelle obama plagiarized her speech from a book too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he also looks like the basketball player that switches to the team that beat his previous team in the playoffs purely because they choked a and blamed in on the previous team he was with not being good enough oh wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt know melania was an illegal immigrant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people that like cardale jones are bitches too lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he is a businessman first and foremost i mean shit we canadians elected a goddamn male model that has a doorknob for a brain
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what are you smoking you cant deny past history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the level of material youd see from any randomly selected thread on rpolitics

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,definitely not comparable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,actorspro athletesceos can say whatever the fuck they want its up to the people to not give a single fuck what they have to say dance monkey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah ive known about him since i was ive only been around years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone supporting clinton is literally retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope they are obviously paid to express these opinions wren they have such a huge audience anything they say should be taken with a grain of salt or rice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doubt that when they are basically drama students
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its pronounced blek
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because opinions aint facts son
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes rioting and destroying your own city is despicable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit actor at best
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to add to this controversially all races arent equal either we all have our strengths and weaknesses but we are all people same with genders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see what i mean lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rename this place niggertwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its all about the continuing the narrative now facts no longer matter thats why he should stick to movies sports etc because they are good one thing theyre ego starts telling them theyre good at everything then they post some emotional video like this that makes no logical sense and then they ruin star wars cause now when you see fin you imagine hes sharing an apartment with lena dunham in canada
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plenty of celebrities have said political shit and went on to continue making money though kanye west said george bush didnt care about black people and it took years before enough people finally got fed up with him rosario dawson got arrested this summer and no one noticed the south park guys have put out way more vapid shit than they have insightful and yet theyre still making money personal brand be damned so long as you look good in front of a green screen youll be alright
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,new star wars was retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lel lel dae drumpf is enough i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you should try to be a whiter person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit niggayou mean not procrastinate get the fuck outta here with that logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hilarious people dont take his political comments seriously because hes a professional ball juggler so he decides to play the race card instead only liberals could be dumb enough to think that thats a good response
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who cares the guys nothing but a damn traitor anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when did talking big on the internet become takes no shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit india used to be a part of africa youre all good im gonna say uboobdood is white and is just trying to get points by calling you out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair actors tend to be some of the stupidest people rather than treating them civilly im all for ridiculing all of them into shutting up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black dude love white women lol it aint even hard to get a white girl if you black thank gawd for rap and the nba
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he didnt suck the movie did fucking terrible just as the next one will be oh well i love real star wars all the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unoproof
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this sub considered racist asking for a friend who is trying to impress a chick who said shes a feminist she cute though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,or they go for the hottest women who tend to be supermodels and you know what the hottest women are white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this whole sub is white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,george soros
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they probably pay of the royalties
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes trying so hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah despite the fact that in reality hes some tiny noname hungarian billionaire with to his name which is probably a fraction of what typical republican corporate interests like bush oil haliburton the rothschilds the vanderbilts the rockefellers etc have all put together anyone claiming one hungarian guy worth is somehow able to dictate the direction of a country with bush oil big pharma haliburton the rothschilds the vanderbilts the rockefellers etc still being on the scene is either fucking delusional or trying to spin you a yarn and brainwash you into this altright for alt read neo for right read nazi bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,naggers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cause tumblr already exists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,definitely gonna inch its way to the frontpage

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae all white people are white supremacists screenshots some original content on twitter to reap karma on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we already advanced colored people

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not afraid of white people the same way i hope youre not afraid of black people i find this whole post kind of disturbing and sad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man now that is just way out of line im incredibly disappointed with bpt if this is the way the mods here are going to act
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all youre doing is fear mongering its not like troops are gonna start rounding everyone who is different also not every republican who voted trump means they are racist honestly people are acting like people will start being hauled to concentration camps calm down you will live
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sounds like youre having yuge panic attack
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you just told people to be afraid of an entire race as a mod of this sub no less do i really need to tell you why thats out of line
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see this is exactly why well never get anywhere here is the real problem people like you constantly make it an us vs them scenario and you guys simply dont have the numbers for that to work i know plenty of black people who voted for trump also here is a quick tip the kind of racists that would actually hurt somebody are never going to be afraid of you theyre going to see the riots the same way you do an opportunity to inflict violence on people they dont like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look buddy i dont know what you think is going to happen but disregarding the fact that obama will still be in office for more months of course rule of law is going to persist trump doesnt hate black people he hates people who hurt his business which is what america is now if youre not a terrorist here illegally or a criminal you dont have to worry
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are unbelievably dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know what im a young black woman and though i didnt vote for him im not completely sold on a trump presidency being the worst thing in the world his victory speech was humble and gracious he acknowledged hillarys accomplishments and contributions as a public servant he also called for unity between parties races faiths etc he said he truly wishes to be a president for all people and i believe hell try for no other reason than his pride wanting him to go down as one of the greatest presidents ever thats a huge comfort to me right now and it beats the shit out of making devisive comments that wont change tonights outcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as the chinese guy in the corner i have been laughing my ass off at this black vs white situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how drunk are you get a grip we will start judging him accordingly come january whether he will be good or bad cant be judged right now

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those white people are so violent and criminal right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my ancestors be from egypt n shieet smh nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump is president your argument is void
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,member when he and his squad gave a ton of guns to mexican cartels or aca that cost poor families more money or lost health coverage or let loose regulations killing fishing energy logging jobs for americans for the first or second black half white president he fucked over black america making him king uncle tom of the democrat plantation i love the idea being floated about slavery being enacted by trump because obama has blacks enslaved with free phones free abortions to kill babies free housing in gun free dangerous projects and even less ways to get out of a shitty upbringing awaken the answer is not trump it definitely wasnt hillary read up on the democratic party skip church and read the entire bible being a good person solves many problems if only we could do what is right and fair and not what comes easy or free
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,speaking as an outsider who has no stake in the gamestill very interested i think this kind of remarks such as all white people are racists or bigots or whatever made a lot of people go yeah well fuck you then ill vote for trump since im already a de facto racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt really answer my question then unless you think veiled racism is in any way better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop over reacting pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aww the poor liberal tears lmao finally this day has come for you to eat your own words
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all white people are racist fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt mods are most likely fat ugly losers with no life just like any other mod
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a shame yall complain about violence against blacks then you out there throwing fists like your muhammad ali
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol youre a fucking clown keep voting for criminals tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get bold k ill just look the other way clutch my purse and hope you dont ask me for a newport you will get real life shot tf up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist against white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im gonna talk to family and friends right now who are have been living hand to mouth trying to achieve the american dream both legally and undocumented it seems you were having a hard time with this but the antonym of legally is actually illegally not undocumented
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but if these same people voted for clinton the argument is the same white people lol come on these are american citizens theres so many white people with different view points this is just stereotyping to the extreme and this is coming from someone who is brown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we did it trump boys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol salty as fuck way to use your mod position to get yourself a forced soapbox youre no better than trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the salt mines
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i didnt vote for trump but people arent bigoted just because they werent willing to let hillary become president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what do you mean you people im a year old collegeeducated white male i voted bernie then i voted clinton are you going to give me a dirty look when we pass each other on the street are you going to feel anger at every white person you see am i to anticipate some form of aggression or action directed at me because im white what are you going to do about this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,took the blue states loser and the red states trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bigoted lol remind me who it was inciting race riots cop killing and made race relations worse than its been in decades again all in a vain effort to energize the minority vote throw there facts out all you want minority turnout plummeted and the result is shown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yada yada at hominems will you ever learn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah problem is that it all boils down to the fact that the election would have a different outcome if the dnc didnt fuck sanders over your argument is retarded it basically says that there is one and only one cause for trumps presidency thats not true thats like saying that white people were responsible for hitler when he achieved his position as dictator through many strategical decisions it is the democrats fault that trump won after the primaries the attitude in america was basically well guess well have to choose the lesser evil ive literally never heard anyone describe sanders like this fuck the dnc i actually disliked sanders when the primaries were on i thought he was a pussy and retarded for going with his socialist thing in a country as anticommunist as america i fell for the media so did the rest of american progressives which polls all of them yeah look at how that turned out trump won thanks to media the dnc white people in that order also as for you citing statistics about white people keep this in mind white people have had the highest percentage of turnout of all racesethnicities except for and when obama was running dont even get me started on the turnout of the rest of the racesethnicities youre blaming white people for actually doing their civic duty of voting what a fucking joke you literally cant make this stuff up this is the exact same reason sanders had a problem in the primaries minorities suck at voting prove me wrong my only problem with trumps presidency is his view on climate change i am not concerned with anything else the american people have spoken and regardless of the colour of their skin they were all given the same opportunity to vote evidently most americans agree with trump who are you to say that theyre wrong thats how democracy works i hope you understand how childish your rant is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont tell me i threw my fucking vote away because i followed my morals and voted for the third party candidate i most agreed with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow tears of sadness because bluecollar america didnt get behind your corporate backed politician the same corporations that have been sending jobs overseas for the last years instead of giving reasons as to why people should vote for her her campaign devolved into nothing but my opposition is trump and to vote against him all the while you delve into the race card i voted thirdparty johnson but had sanders been the nominee which he should have been i would have gladly stood in line to cast my vote for him instead i got the establishment personified because the dnc and corporate media put sanders into a hole and now that clinton has lost i see the delving into racist stereotypes as to why people didnt vote en masse for clinton a trump presidency will be a disaster but i cant help but smile when i read shit like this because i realize that people like you still dont get it nothing but pure idiocy in this post ps you should go back to insulting middle america and marginalizing them in the next election too im sure itll work out just like it has in this one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nothing obviously because everything is the white mans fault duhhh s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democrats still walking around with their noses in the air projecting a false sense of moral superiority democrats had a choice between bernie sanders and hillary clinton bernie sanders fought for civil rights his entire life hillary clinton supported goldwater who voted against the civil rights act clinton called kkk member senator byrd her friend and mentor clinton supported a crime bill that disproportionately targeted minorities while labeling them super predators even to this day clinton supports the war on drugs which is steeped in racism and destroys minority families and communities clinton was against marriage equality her entire life until it was politically expedient to do otherwise this is the choice the democratic party made they are bigots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so mad youll be deported soon enough though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a dumb fuck you probably didnt even vote homo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,um no
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh boy these salty tears taste like heaven have a sad day you liberal cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre insane
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they said this and if youre a minority poc marginalized person who voted for trump or you voted for him because le feminists and political correctness has gone too far i hope his policies affect you like he promised they would basically fuck everyone that disagrees with me and whites are racist pretty pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yay voting with your skincolor and generalize against eachother because of color has always worked to great lets continue to do so blm blm blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,majority of bigoted white people aka the of white people that he pointed out that voted for trump so no reddit hillary clinton and her supporters are not responsible for trumps presidency the majority of bigoted white voters are yeah i said it the same people handed the senate and congress to the republicans the first of its occurence since hes literally calling all the white voters for trump bigots theres so much bias and hes even using his mod power to sticky his own comment dudes mad yo rthemeltdown and rhillarymeltdown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did you sticky your rant do you think your opinion is more worthwhile than those upvoted by the people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i voted trump and i would like to work with all americans all nations races colors genders religions ages fucking species whatever the hell you use to identify yourself lets stop dividing over the nomination especially when nothing has changed yet the tensions in this country over the past year have been ridiculous and i am sure everyone is as tired of it as i am dont let the trolls on other subs get under your skin they are the loud minority just as dems have theirs and indies have theirs end goal here is uniting the united states improving everyones lot in life and helping our neighbors if nothing else this election cycle should prove once and for all dont depend on the government for support youll be left high and dry that wont change we as a nation have to help each other the gov is here to provide law and order lets just get back to that and start fresh i know this post isnt perfect but i hope it at least proves that not all trump supporters are the dumbasses you see on other subs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol melting down bro shit sub get your whining outta here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so niggas was too dumb to go out and vote is that what youre trying to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love the new mod power to sticky comments so i can see you and others stand on your soapboxes why do you think your opinion matters so much more than everyone elses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so basically youre furious white people finally stuck up for themselves after all the bullying race baiting no such thing as reverse racism crap theyve had to tolerate over the past few years cry me a river go ahead ban me i hope it makes you feel better you clearly need it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a salty little bitch about that now arent ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kind of like how clinton would have put a very anti gun scotus in and remove one of our rights written in our first amendments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are one salty man im mexican and i voted for trump because im not an idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is funny because you actually think that the people who post on this sub are black people from twitter even though its just a bunch of liberal white people this just shows that everyone is fed up with obamas lack of performance the last years obamacare will be gone in the first days so hes really done nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah youre right we really need to have a discussion about race based statistics but before we get to voter statistics can we first talk about race based crime statistics 😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,climate change halted thats comedy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she would also be in prison for treason if she was any of us but dont let that get in the way of voting a criminal someone who has time and time again shown she will throw whoever under the bus to further her self someone who couldnt even thank her supporters last night when she lost into the highest position if power that is why a lot of people voted trump they voted trump due to being tired of corrupt politicians selling us out over and over trump might do it but we know hillary will look at her campaign contributors lots of links to syria however its far easier to get emotional and say all white people are racists or what have you instead alienating a group of people who do care about minorities in the process
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats kinda rich coming from american today million people voted for trump guess which countries havent elected racists lately italy and greece
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because if you support trump you hate black people am i right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its nsfw cause this pic is sexy af
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not butt hurt but when hillary said young black men are super predators if i was a young black man and heard that id be pretty angry even if i knew i wasnt a super predator
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for grouping us all together like that i have a feeling theres a word for when you generalise an entire race of people in a negative light i just cant think of the word for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you guys shitposted bernie and hillary stuff all night when you thought she had a chance to win even had a meltdown subreddit too bad the meltdown went the wrong way for you guys lmao you guys claim you want some graciousness in victory but i say fuck you we overcame everything and despite all odds still won so again the poor liberal tears will feed my joy for weeks like it or not tldr move to canada mexico you unamerican fucks since you want them in our country so bad and seem to hate ours so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you guys shitposted bernie and hillary stuff all night when you thought she had a chance to win even had a meltdown subreddit too bad the meltdown went the wrong way for you guys lmao you guys claim you want some graciousness in victory but i say fuck you we overcame everything and despite all odds still won so again the poor liberal tears will feed my joy for weeks like it or not tldr move to canada mexico you unamerican fucks since you want them in our country so bad and seem to hate ours so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and trigger warning because this sub is cucked as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about judging an individual based on their actions as opposed to their skin colour that seems like a reasonable start
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i remember telling you guys there was no brakes on this train and was downvoted there where in fact no brakes shoutout to all the actual blacks who werent okay with being called super predators
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so hillary was president before did i miss a page out of my grade history books or what
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if stop and frisk is validation for you to assume that all white people want to lynch colored folks now then i say affirmative action means that all black people cant read and need the gubment to feed them neither is true and both are retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol telling me to have some class i can celebrate my victory anyway i want youre just mad that im not letting you liberal crybabies down easy half the country was about to leave if trump became president thats class you tried good job but lost accept it tldr it might not of been you personally but youre part of the problem for even sympathizing with these losers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,personally i think this sub is full of uneducated people but i wanted to say this the dude in that video deserved to get his shit rocked he really did that being said i grew up in memphis and maaaaaaan a huge percentage of the black population there is just insufferably crunchy its ridiculous sometimes i moved away and now i travel and i have come to learn that there is just something shitty nasty and stupid about a memphisatl nigga those two cities black youth seem to be in a bitter competition to act the most like a baboon that being said i can almost understand why a white man in memphis could finally lose it and snap
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cracker
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what kind of stupid shit is this yeah so donald trump won the election i guess that means its just open season on black people now s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude its tough i have a lot of black friends back home and where i live now i personally prefer my black friends to my white friends most days but maaaaaaan memphis black folks is a cut below for real when i moved to new orleans one of the very first things i noticed was that when i held the door for a black guy i was thanked in memphis you do that and of black guys will walk thru the door and either mean mug look you straight in the eye and not say shit or will even scoff at you if you visit places outside of memphis and atl youll see it mississippi doesnt count
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking racist piece of shit fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you kidding me trump isnt even president yet and you have really mistaken trump supporters for white supremacists donald trump didnt win because white people hate blacks he won because hillary clinton was corrupt as shit dont act like trump is gonna start a race war when he has stated that hes going to pull money from the iran deal and funnel billions into the inner cities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most of you faggots are white liberals who act like youre black anyways this sub used to be funny and now it has turned into a shitpool of antiwhite garbage

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your salt its delicious george washington and donald trump are the only two presidents with no political experience and thats a good thing or did you not even read wikileaks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,collective guilt huh i guess black folks are going to be thrilled about them collectively having to take the rap for being responsible for almost all violent crime now since this is the new standard and women with false rape reports and blah blah blah do you want a race war this is how you get a race war

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,at least white people vote op should be bitching to his fellow minorities who regularly have low voter turnout i voted for clinton and im tired of the bullshit excuses from people sanders had a better chance at beating trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah lets blame white people that will help
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe if more black people voted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,glad you think blacks will be shot for no reason youre an idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahaha 😂 ill have some more salt with my popcorn thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just gonna say you are woefully blinded in your opinions and analysis i graduated from a university and currently work on wall street i deal with people like you on the reg you are a pseudointellectual in that you think youre above people but really youre not youre a mod in bpt lol the real decision makers and people who care about policy voted for trump over hillary despite how easily winnable this election was for the democrats im obviously not mad unlike you but stop thinking youre so high and mighty im smarter than you and make more money sit down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,somebodys salty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you can actually cross off pennsylvania and minnesotathey were that sweet sweet color red trump trump trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why because you dont get treated like your a king not all white people are rascist but you need to feel like your some victem in society cry rasicsm times over nothing and people stop giving a shit people treating you bad dont hate black people they hate your qualities as a person any attack against your qualities is seen as racist since you cant handle being criticised
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what a cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,arseholes yeah talking about brexit like its remotely relatable to trump getting elected fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when the hillarys campaign manager from her loss to obama debbie wasserman shultz becomes the dnc chair and the former dnc chair becomes hillarys vp pick tim kaine on top of all the voter suppression and bias by the dnc yea this is solely the dncs fault the dnc conspired against bernie and then the citizens said id rather have that idiot over that crook so its not the uninformed citizens its the fed up citizens and this is coming from a berner that reluctantly voted for hillary just to cancel a trump vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she called us names i didnt just bring it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes not next in line until january until then pence isnt shit weve got a deadline folks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first of all are you seriously suggesting this sub isnt racist it fucking is theres no debate about it second of all based on your reasoning it doesnt fucking matter the kkk endorsed clinton so obviously all people who voted for clinton are white supremacists this is using your logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that and hes conflating voting for trump as being racist the most likely reasoning for most of the votes was fuck hillary not even gonna go into how shitty our two party system is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my nigga when is done we will never speak of this mf ever again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is bpt not rpolitics idc if youre a mod leave this shit elsewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol its ironic cause youre racist

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude having a panic attack praying he doesnt get brought to heel by hilldawg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lgbtq fuck off being queer is no different from being gay lesbian bi or trans any nonstraight sexuality beyond those is some special snowflake tumblerina bullshit

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,another weak post nothing to see here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet were posting pictures of a woman who got famous cause of porn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyones making nuanced arguments about why trump won but can we at least agree that the real reason he won is that a shitload of americans are stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe because they dont all vote the way the media tells them to vote maybe they actually look at the candidates objectively and decided hillary black kids are super predators clinton was the actual racist party
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,very tolerant of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i whip ma hair back nd forth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,career criminal ftfy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,buy yeezy can have the first lady who was made famous for being a hoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahaha dont be so butt hurt bubs youll be okay your inability to keep yourself from flying off the rails when presented with different views that dont match your own is exactly why trump won the election
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,goddamn these comments complaining about harambe voters make me mad no these votes werent stolen from hillary no they couldnt have swayed the election or saved america because for a vote to count towards hillary that person must be willing to vote for hillary in the first place and the same goes for hillary lost because her voters didnt show up in high enough numbers or hillary lost because of third party candidates these are not hillarys votes cause they havent been cast for her hillary lost because not enough people wanted to vote for her plain and simple
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,handle it pussywhole world just avoided said herself that if she became president she would start a war against iranso you are lucky you ignorant bastard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you point flys off to tangential superhell with all the ebonical jibba jabba
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know who else didnt make things better for hillary the millions that voted for our next president of the united states you sore fucking losers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao get fucked loser
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i definitely get the point you want to blame people who dont want shit to be black and white for eternity and not every factor that contributed to trump winning the dnc hillary the way the electoral college works and the fact that he got the fucking votes you blame the smallest factor because youre a coward
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont understand this do blacks really think they are going to get murdered in cold blood by cops now or end up a slave i get it you dont like trump but jesus you people are dramatic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck off the immigration act was guaranteed not to change us demographics yet the white population share went from well over to low the people that came not only consistently vote against white interests they get privileges unavailble to whites and constantly insult and complain not only should nonwhite immigration be forbidden until the white population share is back over all the ungrateful fucks arriving after the should have their citizenship stripped and be deported make america white again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this stanky ostrich looking skank is famous for being some brappers cum dumpster ive had liquid stool with more integrity than this used up burlap sack

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i meant what i said
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we should mix it up more than that year olds only vote for house and senate year olds only vote for president and governor votes for all local elections
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpimgurcomavcbwh they both seemed pretty hated by youths online but even if you saw the opposite the polls showed the opposite of what you saw from a non usa person whos confused by your anecdotal response
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love to swim in the tears of the whiny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whos she calling welfare offices getting ready to cash her obama checks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck the ham sandwich cheese steaks are where its at
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet for some reason all the mass killers over here are misunderstood good christian boys 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you dont get it if working class people are constantly talked down to by the liberal elite and labelled as racist backwards and stupid with no opportunity to defend themselves then dont be surprised if they vote for a candidate that defends them youre dividing america youre pushing people towards trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,realdonaldtrump then fucking move
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh honey no theres not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,only about of americans at the peak of slavery had slaves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,only white people fuck their cousins smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,niggas are actually capacitating puppies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no african american has any land or living relative back in africa but it doesnt stop white people from telling us to go back to africa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,never said they did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cause it would work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racism is some rough shit against anyone dude not offended just somewhat confused at the hypocritical nature of your post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then give me more please i think youre the one in denial here you used cnn as a source youre aware of their extreme collusion with the dnc right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah dude didnt you know if you are white you have owned a slave even if you are a generation immigrant from slovakia im actually gonna get all of my stuff and give it to the nearest black and tell them they can move into my shitty apartment because they cant get their own lives together they need help from me dont worry ill be fine living off the fact that i was the sole reason a black got his life back on track
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,upvotes and no comments yet heres this useless comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and black people are lazy and abuse government welfare and latinos are all drug lords
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,follow for more iggillbatesmemes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre fucking stupid go kill yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone keeps calling things l what does that even mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well since they bitch about systematic racism which hasnt existed for about years then yes they should probably move the fuck on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most people on this sub are white 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,instead of protesting you should instill a love of learning and self improvement upon your children my girl teaches at an almost all black school they act like animals totally the parents fault there is no one else to blame
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because tshirt propagating racist terrorist organization is perfect for family dinner
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for showing me this sub haha i subscribed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you and your circle jerk victim reddit this sub just proves how stupid nonloyal in relationships and completley void of any indipendant thought most of you negroes are fucking street trash ive grown up around you pieces of fatherless shit and know exactly how to deal with you its funny that you poc would call anyone else a wasteman try taking a look at your people and culture lol also president trump motherfuckers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive grown up in the hood most blacks that cling to their dumbass identity are literally at the same intelligence tier as chimps the ones who decide to actually stay in school and work hard i respect since it seems your shit culture encourages young black men to turn to crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just playing devils advocate here to try and speculate a rational nonracist answer to ops question i think that some folks dont see celebrity protests as depicted in pics in the meme as legitimate protests because it feels like the protestors are doing it for selfaggrandizement and not in full interest of the actual cause itself for instance lots of people saw kaepernicks protest as a way for him to remain relevant despite his recent failures even popular athletes and celebrities might be seen as doing it to promote their brand since they know lots of their fans support these ideas certainly this is kind of a cynical viewpoint since obviously these people are entitled to freedom of speech just as much as anyone else but it may just seem kind of tacky when its pretty obvious that the actors in one of the hottest plays in the country pretend they lack as much privilege as the average black american but of course the counterargument is that these people can use their celebrity to give a voice to a cause that is voiceless i think in most cases though people are just sick of celebrities telling them what to believe on race politics the environment whatever and would rather rely on them solely for entertainment a separate complex issue as well again not saying i agree just trying to formulate a rational response
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we been trying to kill this mini hitler for half a century and it takes trump only weeks under budget and ahead of schedule
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats also racist and hypocritical
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think i just found my new favorite sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the people rioting in the streets arent the same people as the celebrities in the other photos or may ben this is a joke post is this a joke post your not actually defending rioting and hate crimes right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fast and furious this is fun now that weve actually won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he gon take mah wellfare
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people didnt turn out for her because she is one of the most corrupt politicians ever not hyperbole the email thing was pure and simple a crime i was a marine for years i went through all kinds of opsec training she knew what she did was wrong and extremely careless as comey put it is the same fucking thing as gross negligence which is what the actual law states intent is irrelevant if you go around and actually talk to people who voted for trump such as myself i will say a large reason i knew early that i was voting for trump is because hillary would be a horrible president she has no earned experience as everything she has done is the result of marrying bill and the experience she does have is shit experience its also very hard to look at her actions as sos and the donations to the clinton foundation and not at least raise your eyebrows i am also sick of this far left pro marxist bullshit i see everywhere on my campus in my far left prosocialist history book by eric foner and that all of this is pushed by the oppression obsessed groups that with the administrations approval work to keep conservative speakers like ben shapiro from even speaking on campus when you stop ideas from being heard because you dont have good enough ideas to fight back with people start to notice and thats why youre the bad guys now and if you remove only la county trump wins the popular vote i dont want my president decided by the most out of touch morons who get paid millions to read shit other people wrote the electoral college stopped a bad president from being elected seems like it did its job and you refuse to accept that the lefts actions play any role in not just trump winning but winning over of all counties republicans have the house and senate too and if trump does ok in years there are democratic senate seats in contested newly red areas its more than just this one guy because i know lots of republicans who voted down ballot only or are you going to give me some bullshit about how the senate is gerrymandered too lol when people tell you why they voted maybe listen the left hasmjustmcalled all conservatives racist bigots and never chose to listen and now we are going to control everything and possibly have a senate super majority in years your tactics arent working maybe start looking at the worthless policies that none of us want starting with the aca
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean the house or the senate its more than just the presidency youre driving the economy and culture into the ground and blaming people who want a smaller government for all your problems trump is a symptom but when we have a senate super majority in years im sure you wont have learned anything and you will keep crying haha feels good to see yall fuckin lose tho no consolation prizes in real life but keep up with the protests trumps approval rating has gone up since those started
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,agreed thats why we just voted them out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,solid repost
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all trump did was make some money and grab some pussy and yall mad at him half yalls lyin asses voted for him and too and still wont admit it so now he president and yall pretended like you didnt wish for this

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black girls saying this when they have multiple offspring they cant even support on their own financially what country would want to take you in have fun living in guatemala or any of those other dictatorship crime ridden utopias that are so much better than a democratic state
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im still waiting on you to prove anything youre saying do you want me to post the thousands of terrible articles and first hand accounts of the people oppressed by castro an actual argument isnt just saying oh that didnt happen thats bullshit which is all you liberal shit heads that would defend a dictator can say its no surprise you all would act this way when youre candidate for president got millions in donations from people just as deplorable as castro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,actually this argument is over why dont you go back to the commie subreddits or syrian war shitposting you are clearly fucked in the head
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does everyone on here try to talk like theyre black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is everyone is san francisco a homo like you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,messed up minorities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that guy is a racist i dont care hes black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some of them my grandfather is but my other grandparents not so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre on the internet defending fidel castro in between shitposting about the war in syria and now youre throwing out what you assume is edgy so you dont have to admit that you know nothing about what youre talking about so yes you are a supreme cuck now go get your sorry ass mother to warm you up some tendies before she goes and gets your disability check from the mailbox because youre too fucking fat and worthless to get out of your computer chair while you shitpost and dream of a socialist world that will never be
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpmimgurcomtpszhtl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol so you realllllllly dont know what youre talking about then great cheers asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i got called a racist for voting for trump after trying to explain why i support him the bitch said another dumb ass hispanic who thinks trump is on their side
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,at least white parents are around for months cant say that much for black parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea because then you could just sell it to the child sex market for some 💸💸💸
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the child will most likely be replaced if its china were talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the actual one is here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am from the states but the fact is we are the only place you can catch niggas giving an award to everyone and foreigners are soft af have you even left your backyard ive been around the world twice to places you probably cant even spell there are killers even in places that are rich af like dubai your another idiot jumping on the bandwagon smoke my dick clown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because im a retard and thought his dad was the donald
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rniceguys is leaking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im slowly starting to realize that liberals can also be just as racist its just in their own little special way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right thats definitely summer still but these niggas dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i aint famous so i am self promoting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea ok so theres like pics of a black guy giving a group of white people the exact same stare when they are taking some kind of pic and its just white people be actin crazy but when its the exact same pic with the races switched all of a sudden thats a racist white guy that dont want you to be successful
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well what happens is the actual black people see some good shit and upvote it usually it is then followed by an inordinate amount of reports sent by white people from rall because of racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ill believe it when i see proof
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you got me there mate i take it you are american born and raised i bet you dont shit in the pool or masturbate to young children i can trust you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i take it you dont rape people because you are horny i take you value a womans rights i take it you wouldnt want to know your daughter will most likely be raped
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe black people should make themselves more desirable as employees
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh man mod drama who cares
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those better be sandwiches on that fuckin table
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be real for a moment theres a disturbingly large number of black people in college who write like they speak and they dont speak well to put it lightly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they all ugly too specially old snaggle tooth on the left
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hope your condom breaks next time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,zimmerman is an insult now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look at their faces they are beyond proud and happy that they managed to fill the room with white women as if it is a diversity accomplishment icing on the cake is the actual minority asians shoved waaaaaaay in the back
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you kinda have to know the difference between ask and axe to work at huffpo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thedonald isnt even this bad he gotta get his ass over to pol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you can tell progressives are fake when they try so damn hard to have women staffs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the other weird thing is that all these chicks are in the range as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair overlooking qualifications in order to force diversity in your workplace doesnt feel ethical either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no bombing them wont solve it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lack of diversity more like it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,misandry is a thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more like muffington post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so i guess diversity not men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats pretty much the sjw demo these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people asian people and men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seriously i must have missed that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does this work for everything but white dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and numales
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gottttt emmmm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,feminists think everything will be better if its all woman therefore if you dont like whats going on here you must hate women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitest title ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,actually you cant be sexist against men so they arent being sexist s but this is literally what huffpo believes thats why theyre actually bragging about not having any male editors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shots fired perfect aim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,antisjw crowd how very dare you we prefer the term social inequality warrior
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh the court hearing that i watched didnt say anything about him being a murder or beating his wife source for him being a wife beater selling the gun and taunting the family is pretty fucked up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jesus if theyre only going to hire young white women at least hire a few hot ones its all dogs at the dinner table there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what most companies are you talking about i think youre just parroting rhetoric
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it says that it was his ex girlfriend and that she recanted her statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre also of the population and commits of the murders that could go a long way toward explaining the discrepancy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea fuck dem hoez
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thatll do pig thatll do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they probably dont have black people living in huffington or men for that matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf why is this comment section freaking out about the lack of diversity or sex who fucking cares of people here are just looking for a reason to get offended by anything and anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,feminism we deserve the right to vote and own property feminism we deserve equal access to education and employment feminism fuck everyone except us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice buzzwords what you said has literally no relevance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rule of posting anything on the internet you will offend someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre all retarded brainwashed liberal sjws
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you guys are delusional if you think thos women arent over lol whats it matter newspapers editorsare full of old white guys for hundreds of years in america now a different
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,makes sense that their articles all stink of fish vag
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that means other companies should go out of their way to not hire men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so we have a shitty analogy and now a strawman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe everyone else should just git gud
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is it really surprising that the site that posts man hating shit on a daily basis is composed entirely of women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ill be surprised if there isnt a serious case of queen bee syndrome running rampant in those offices there are endless anecdotes of allfemale workplaces being total unmitigated disasters precisely because of their gender
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a homogenous group not an example of diversity you played yourself stupid bitch i like how she thinks an all woman business meeting is worth celebrating but if it was all men shed be screaming about the patriarchy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think this quote is very relevant to what you just said httpiimgurcomgpeqbwxjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can see a man applying there masters in journalism from nyu published aplenty previous jobs at some of the most illustrious publications on the planet yeah sorry theres just something missing from your cv i cant really put my finger in it i mean on it on it of course anyway good luck and thanks for applying to the huffington post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can smell the office drama from here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine if a company with all white men posted the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shouldve banged your dick on the conference table like a chocolate thor hammer asserted dominance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope that is also a sign that apparently a shit to of white males take their job seriously and work exceedingly hard over several years racial and sex diversity should increase if it doesnt there may be foul play but it also may mean white males are simply better for those jobs thats life thats reality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the racist thing would be to hire someone only because of his race hire the best available if there is no black in these group of people its not their fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people want society to hire people based on race remember the last time we did that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looks like the mods here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look a table of mostly white women all with overpriced computers living their sheltered lives complaining about how unjust the world is how evil the straight white man is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thread full of people cherry picking who shouldshould not be working at a given company by their skin color seems kind of regressive and most importantly hypocritical given that the main objection is racism cries
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look at all the creative writing and gender studies degrees
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,token black lady that is under qualified and treated like a pet and given only special black interest assignments introduced this week with formal apology the liberal way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right on actually its better for public use
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uhh what exactly are the first two emojis depicting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,btfo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they also all have macbooks because women just buy what other womennumales buy to seem popular
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looks like the huffington post took advantage of the gender wage gap
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,made it so there will be nothing interesting for men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i cant believe someone was so clueless that they thought posting this was a good idea its far worse that none of them are old enough to have substantial life experience than it is that they all are white women with gender studies degrees from dartmouth i thought they would be better looking at least one or two of them i still cant believe someone was so clueless that they thought posting this was a good idea i thought they would be heavier but i suppose that wont happen until they hit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,absolutely hilarious to see the regressive left fight over whos more oppressed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not sure i buy that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what if men did this im sure its not a very big accomplishment when there is a meeting with all men lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh no theres not one of every possible race in every public picture put out by an organization they must be racist

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wouldnt that just be an airball in this situation during a game the shot looks like it at least has a chance of going in an airball message thats never opened has no hope of ever going in for example on this in game of the memphis grizzlieslos angeles clippers series the ball hangs on the rim and looks like its going to drop in eventually its decided that the ball will just hang there and never go in so they just remove the ball from the rim this results in a jump ball i feel like equivalent of this happening would be the girl opens the message and starts typing for a really long time but never actually responds eventually she stops typing and you give up on her responding so you delete the message so in reality the title should say something like when you shoot your shot and she start typing so you think she gonna respond but she never does

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that theyre more dangerous than alligators
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,count me in too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when black women on this sub cheat theyre hoes and ratchet when a dude cheats especially if gets away with it hes the fucking top dog pun intended its straight bullshit if youre cheating on someone who cares about you then you go back to continue the abuse afterwards youre just a straight up fucking piece of shit human in need of therapy or am ass beating
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i think its the fact that an alligator is more likely to comply with a police officers orders and doesnt think its exempt from law
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so sad to see how liberal reddit is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you people really fucking hate your parents huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its real this place is full of cucks who can predict the future same people who regurgitated the hillarys gonna win trump has a chance of winning provided to them by corporate news they never learn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah but its being used to insult baby boomers so its ok this time thats the modern political climate i have principles and beliefs but am willing to sacrifice any and all of them for a chance to throw a snarky insult at the other side
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what makes a joke a joke then culturally speaking i havent seen any posts here that praise women cheating the way i see posts praising men for being dogs is it funny just because haha we got the stupid bitch and she wont ever find out we creepin smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how blm was so impotent up until the election now all yall complains about are losing the election and obamas last days in office
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why would you know what websites any of your friends visit thats a boring conversation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is was these
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im latino but im white does that still make me a minority its confusing to me honestly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,worst title ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,millennials claim to be masters of technology yet complain they cant find jobs maybe they just have a fundamental misunderstanding about which skills are valued at what levels maybe that guy cant format a hard drive but he knows how to weld guess who is always gonna have a job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they have pretty much the same subscribers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im asian i dont belong here at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah swimming
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol the point you tried to illustrate about nyc being expensive to the tune of is overblown misinformed and cliche if it were sarcastic then maybe youd have something there but if you want to keep spewing the same unoriginal garbage im gonna tell you to shut the fuck up so shut the fuck up you clown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive only ever heard my black friends use light dark red yellow etc never heard anyone say lightskin or darkskin to be honest though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bro wtf is this title you just took the joke and made it shittier
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what difference does it make the lol its just a joke is the same shit the trump people say its not right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow im seeing racism between black people thats a change
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,true that i was just trolling the racialised history of swimming especially in regards segregation of pools in america is sad and fascinating these two articles in the atlantic are good reads
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in a sub known for shitty titles this one stands out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the sentiment of the comment was sane most if not all of the black men who have been shot by police have failed to comply adequately with police and overall thinks theyre better than the law this leads to them dying the fact that a crocodile survives instead of a black guy is telling of which is more dangerous in a situation police dont just kill because they feel like it if you think that a police officer is going to kill a black guy because hes racist you are deluded to say the least
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was meant as a joke the joke being an alligator complies better with police than a black guy would and obviously some butthurt ensued
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why am i not surprised that you couldnt refute any of my points and instead resorted to ad hominem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ububatman and the silly millennials have to di it for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,joke or not generalizing people by their skin color is all this sub does anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,enjoy the hour of not being shot by the police
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think if any white people are downvoting out of anger theyre just pissed because theyre tired of being called racists by people who then turn around and do the same thing to other black people just because theyre skin is lighter like isnt that the problem in the first place generalizing a whole group of people based on their skin color
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people if you were black for hour what would you do me i would go sunbathing lolz
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly lol thats what people usually say when theyre told something they cant argue against
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes so adorable i bet white people would fuck him while still giving him a hard time about not being white tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont understand why you guys dont say that to them lol after all your ancestors bulit america on their backs the white house was built by both slaves and free negros as well as some irish an poor whites if anything this is more your country than theirs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy shit i am saving a link to this thread just in case someone doesnt believe that reddit is really really stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you inspired me to google this bitch as well this is the type of girl who needs the d constantly or she goes all haywire and shit if she got a daily dose of some thick ass pipe she would turn into rachel maddow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ya dont whites created modern civilization you ungrateful fuck if you owned this country it would be a third world hell hole like the one you all came from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not sure thats necessary wait an hour and youll be eligible for minority grants and get into college for free your food stamps might not work for an hour though😕
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i want to debate her so bad i wouldnt do her stupid ass like trevor noah either im going for her throat probably in more ways than one with that last thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only attention she gets on blackpeopletwitter is people talking about her having sex with black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,name a black country that doesnt suck look dont even bother just thank me for my ancestors pulling the bone from your great great grandads nose and beating that dumb tribal shit out of him so you could grow up in a nice white country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we tried to civilise you savages yet youre still ayyy playa yo peoples dindo dick so much wasted time should have just left yall doin raindances out in the jungle 😉😉🐒🐵
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck fptp
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this goes both ways black people cant constantly be bringing up slavery since they obviously were never involved and most of their ancestors werent involved either maybe both sides should just move on but it feels like black people are more consumed with the past than whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont see how working at a cotton plantation is equivalent in importance to having developed architectural and construction methods for thousands of years also dont forget things like sewage and electricity and many other systems that allowed society to function on such a scale european immigrants built modern america i dont really see how shes wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao im more of a fucking he liberal into you than fucking the conservative out of you type of dude whatever works
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,women with short hair are justugh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone doesnt understand how conquest works
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a conservative classical liberal i find both tomi and lauren refreshing compared to the hags in the legacy media
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt buncha haters hating on a young good looking year old millionaire all set to take a slot on foxnews before she turns yall are making this girl an icon by staying mad she loves it her audience loves it her wallet loves it girl out here driving a cadillac while the haters stay paying for uber foh just ignore her damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres a very clear difference in thinking between her followers and people who think shes stupid i for one feel like she completely destroyed tn on his show i felt extremely embarrassed for him he couldnt refute anything she said
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,eh she actually made him look pretty stupid from what i remember bit cringeworthy actually
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall mad at tomi lahren because she speaks a lot of truth shes a little fucked and does go off on bullshit tagents sometimes but she mostly speaks the truth about special snowflakes bullshit blm and a whole bunch of other things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is like the black version of the neckbeard fantasy these things only happen within your feeble minds
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kinda dumb because whites created the united states of america lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes a fucking democratic party establishment monkey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if maury cannot find out who your dad is maybe it is not his fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the united states wasnt a country until the settlers came and named it that it was just a big mass of land with a few primal tribes this witty comeback never takes that into account
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes informed and gorgeous something the left knows nothing about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uh we conquered it fair and square
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont remember black people building one of the most advanced civilizations in history traversing an incomprehensible distance on a boat and conquering an entire landmass making the spoils of war include the conquered land i do remember hearing something about how their tribe leaders in africa happily sold their brothers and sisters into slavery though in fact i dont recall black people building much of anything without whiteys help why all the hate for the people that lifted you out of the dirt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,implying this subs population is even black people i came for the memes like everyone else sorry just gotta call out dumb shit when i see it well can i catch a ride with you cause this aint your shit either umm it kind of is if blacks cant accept that they are free to fuck off back to their stone age continent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you going to learn how to read
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ummmmmmmm you dont look so well informed yourself bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this comment drips with white guilt though and uses whataboutism to justify the results of european imperialism across the world
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,guys advocating for rape of person with different political views other than your own is still rape
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah dude how aobut you scuk a dikc dsylxeia is a fkae diesae
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people who tell other people to go back to their own homeland are dumbasses and people who imply that white people stole land are dumbasses poking at one another for what our great great great grandparents did hundreds of years ago is dumb as hell and counterproductive i know this is all just a joke but seriously if i was held responsible for what my parents did then i would be a meth head and in prison i also would abandon my children and i wouldnt have graduated college so fuck the idea that im responsible for what someone with my same skin color did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,agreed i hate what she says but i think she held her ground pretty well they conveniently edited out trevor noah agreeing with her on the obamacare issue he said true she made a good point there for herself though i dont agree with that his traffic lights comeback was pretty lame but shes lame too to equate kkk and blm just to be controversialall for that sweet fame noah couldve handled that better kkk is still there blm cant be new kkk was his comeback like really thats what youre going to go with when there are literally dozens of other valid reasons
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah my 🅱 thats how someone explained it to me when i was looking into it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,asked kaepernick to go back to africa because she thought it was wrong to peacefully protest by not standing up for the anthem iirc not sure if it was kaepernick or someone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i bet she has a come to jesus moment in a couple years and admits she was wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,primarily posts in drunk skincareaddiction and blackpeopletwitter calling others basic and saying shit like bitches with lots of makeup arent pretty but surely its just the kettle thats black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rmeirl for noncucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha racist people are funny af
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of black kids born out of wedlock shits sad fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go back to your safe space honey
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah they both kinda suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you cucks have some sick fetishes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,genocide
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt even make sense rblackpeopletwitter isnt an opinion its a content community just because he disagrees with the opinions of other members doesnt mean he doesnt belong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt realize you were the african king of this sub sorry typical black mindset response their cellphone is literally the most important object in their lives willing to starve their kids to lineup for a fucking iphone that will be paid by their welfare money so they can go in twitter all day and circlejerk about their oppressors go trash the still standing architecture in africa because it was designed by white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,explain how it was stupid and ridiculous my view is that it was a lean comparison if anything the kkk has never inspired national race riots what blm lacks in lynch mobs they make up for in rhetoric and mental deficiency which leads to mobs and people like micah johnson murdering cops in cold blood sure the mission of blm and the kkk are entirely different but the outcome of the rhetoric is no different in my eyes its all whites vs blacks us vs them with no self reflection
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she has the figure and face of a year old boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,never been there is that a coffee shop in portland
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first off read your own stupid username before you suffer in this argument what do you think a neoliberal is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because africa isnt on the way you fucking idiot look up a map on that computer instead of trying to track down your daddy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god forbid someone in the media has a different political view than your own
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,disgusting bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the point doesnt change just because of the messenger

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hello i am a bot made to detect and explain common chatinternet acronymsslangi have detected one or more such items in this comment if this seems incorrect please send me a pm to address the mistake the following definition comes from netlingocom u yo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the guys point isnt that wanting a poc to win is racist wanting a poc to win over a white person simply because you want the white person to lose is a little racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what the fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fact that you acknowledge that sex with her would only be on the basis of hatred shows how bigoted you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i honestly dont understand how you missed my point root for whoever you want but wishing the other people to lose simply because of their race is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nolivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody likes arabs tbh fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol oh you mad huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shouldnt you be letting terrorists rape your family out of existence back in sweden maybe your self hate is so ingrained within you that you think its okay that sweden is the rape capital of the western world perhaps you shouldnt be advocating for hatefucks and worry about the women in your country or are you too big of a doofus to realize your country is already fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no denial just a weakass strawman this ls for you mama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the difference yall got bought and shipped here we came oops around with disease and made homes on top of now diseased ridden dead natives over in tree swinging whoop nation they never bothered with writing shit down didnt even bother writing down why they hate each other just spear chukking each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your a cool guy looking at people comment history on christmas eve loser
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall sound like straight uncle toms
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what about all the other mass immigrations in history where they ended in voilence also it isnt we you and i were not alive durring this time period and dont have to suffer for what other people have done you dont take on your ancestors debt if we did everyones hands would be soaked in blood it is okay to immigrate especially if your home land was destroyed but that doesent mean open the borders and bring in millions of people who wont have anywhere to go or any jobs to work or anything done to transition them the people who dont assimilate arent just gunna sit on the ground and be homeless amd starve they wil riot and try to force out society to go backwards to be like theirs they want to vote even though they arent citizens try that in any other country and see what they say nobody wants to look at the negatives though as itbwould be racist to not just allow anyone to live here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what have you done
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,eww
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they came here legally jk my great grandfather got deportedto canada
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so youre a bigot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo do we really have to say this in every fucking tomi lahren thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some people will never find transgenders attractive because of their origins and there is absolutely no way to change that at least not yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not a medical treatment its essentially cosmetic surgery like plastic surgery except you mutilated yourself too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do you read through comment histories do you care that much kind of embarassing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you ignore her she goes away as a minority not only has this never worked ever its actually incredibly damaging
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only thing you hatefuck is that your hand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,best recent example is those who elected gop governors who turned away federal money free money to fund obamacare for the poorest people poor white people voted against getting free healthcare but hey now they can insult obama when they cant afford premiums
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lauren southern is not a republican
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,neocons are not very conservative rinos your comment is ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,😖
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real tho no one would have anywhere to go if we all were made to leave the land our ancestors took
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hi quincyno thanks for submitting to rblackpeopletwitter however your submission has been removed this action was taken because its a repost if you disagree with this action you can please include a link to your post so that we can see it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think his point is that tomi lahren is not particularly good looking in anyway there are millions of young white girls who look similarjust as good so theres no reason to be fawning over her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,speaking about things that happened a thousand years ago is stupid because it doesnt affect anyone today thats the fucking difference and it more times than not fucks over a lot of people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,under a rock apparently
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea thats what this is about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am just as shocked as u are surprised that fact i said she is basic which is fucking true triggered every closet white person on this fuckin sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the response to my unexciting comment really brought them out of the shadows didnt it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seen pussy rdefinitelynotmeirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,med research does not identify as a mental illness gender dysphoria is not the same thing as being trans gender dysphoria is the presence of severe dysfunction which is then classified as an illness a person who feels as if theyre trans and then has reassignment surgery will never be diagnosed as having gender dysphoria everyone has anxiety but not everyone will be diagnosed with anxiety disorder and need anxiolytics please dont speak on something you know nothing about furthermore xxy xxx xxy and other sex chromosome abnormalities due to nondisjunction sex and especially gender are far more complex than just the type of chromosomes intrachromosomal interactions alone are a field of study that show that its much more murky than what youre saying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,arabs are pretty hatable tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo momma a guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is not representative of black culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh you mean that srs satellite sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they can but gotta spent it on a blunt and cigars
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay im locking this shitfest of a thread heres why threatening to rape someone who sucks doesnt make it ok typical rthedonald schlock get a life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,congrats for reaching ralltop of the day top with your post nbsp i am a bot probably quite annoying i mean no harm though message me to add your account or subreddit to my blacklist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i dont like this person either these comments are absolutely shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not crying though hillary lost bernie stole his supporters money which is hilariousnah im fine
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aww man that sucks i realise i sound like a white racist but if it makes you feel better i prefer dogs to white people too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha nigga thats lit fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre an absolute fucking retard like murder rates have anything to do with being targeted by the police what the fuck makes absolutely no sense funny how the south side of chicago over black is a fucking war zone and the police wont go anywhere near it interesting how thats never brought up also funny how the cops dont go there looking for someone to brutalize considering their undying love for locking up black people its clearly gang culture and fatherless families but feel free to continue blaming all your problems on police brutality and duh white man all of you are losers looking for someone to blame your problems on no different than fat white feminists blaming male privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice comeback i could not give less of a fuck about my username it has absolutely zero significance to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,again nice comeback instead of addressing anything i said you wasted your time calling my username real stupid really shows you have no idea what the fuck youre talking about and no original thoughts of value pleasure talking to you for everybody elses sake dont weigh in on any conversations other than epik maymays which im sure youre well versed in
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you literally kill people when you block highways its not acceptable in a civil society
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if he blocked highways preventing emergency vehicles from getting places then yeah he was knowing mlk though id say he probably wasnt quite that stupid though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because we have a pretty civil society that works because we care about and respect others around us creating racial tension by attacking white students in libraries etc doesnt make the situation better it quite literally makes it worse providing ammo for racists to use against the movement and estranging well meaning white people from the movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i n n o v a t i o n n n o v a t i o n
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this nigga look like hopsin if he wasnt such a total faggot

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its cause hes looking at the first shooter girl back left looking at the second one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the text makes sense because why would a black guy want to be around white people at all theyre pure evil and not to be trusted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ha i get it hes black and theres white people around him lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,still makes him a token regardless of the circumstances
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but then hit the blunt and remember white pussy worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its a great thing when people have a lot more confrontations with cops due to the color of their skin the vastly disproportionate amount of violent rime they commit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know math can be a dick sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not his view its a fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the feeling is mutual
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your logic is flawed across the board
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,have no idea about racial equality and think alllivesmatter are you trying to say that some peoples life dont matter whos exactly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes kick out that black friend its pointless anyway because privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you guys just fucking smile once in a picture holy fuck yeah everyone else is having a good time ill just be a boring ass

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude liberals posing as republicans burned down a church in this campaign thats every bit as bad as the dumb white girl who carved a b into her own face saying it was black guys who threatened her to vote obama in both sides are bad liberals are attacking and harming and intending to kill people too sure on a waaaaaay smaller scale and not as a real political position but its still happening so playing the all liberals are good all republicans are bad card is just wrong

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know kanye isnt the only black person stepping up but hes the only one stepping up who has the publics eye thats my point plenty of other black celebrities and influential figures could be capable of this but they havent made moves to quell dissatisfaction with trump kanye has influence is everything

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,¿¿dude just said he wanted to combat serious issues in our society and the first thing thats said is hes out of his mind kanye west has spent his whole career talking about some of these issues for fucks sake hes a rapper from chicago and suddenly its all just irrelevant now what the fuck right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so mods i just checked out rule dont you think that this sort of post is baiting for rule violations

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and thats a bad thing lol yall always hatin on trump just like the media tells you i didnt even vote for the nigga but come on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just to be noted none of these clowns know anything about the hood fellow year old white guy who looks to pretend hes black on reddit

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so jayz and beyonce can cuddle up with hillary and its fine nothing to see hear move along
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id hate to be black because yall a bunch of racists to other black people with different views smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae blacks that support republicans racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people dont want to see their heroes support someone they were told to dislike for a bunch of bullshit reasons a month ago kanye was real spoke his mind was a rich independent entrepreneur who was leading free and open thought pushing talent moving boundaries now hes a sellout or maybe hes just smart enough and willing enough to give it all a shot elon musk just joined trump i guess an innovation genius is awful too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,donald must have gotten a couple shades too dark on accident
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ahhhh yes blm like when bill clinton issued the three strikes law and when hillary wanted to bring the black community to heel what has trump said negatively about the black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeezys got a for yall
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah good old leftwing racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im black and get called white because i dont act black im a nerd and ive been ostracized for it in the past and people black white otherwise still casually joke about it the hell do you mean internalized racism when its really a problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,chill yo he was joking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you ever thought the left was the party for diversity and inclusiveness search kanye uncle tom on twitter and hav r your illusions shattered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id have to argue the fact that society has the same if not more racism today than when bill was prez especially with all the blm and cop killings going on today what id like to point out is that in the trump insisted on accepting blacks and jews into his golf courses when others did not the clintons at this time belonged to segregated golf courses i think its actions like this that shows hes not a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,remember when hillary said she was on colored people time i remember
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so segregated subs then not sure what you mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and your comment tells me youre racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no he didnt im guessing youve been watching too much cnn in your free time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so is every black a house nigga because they like trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao arguing issues you aint know shit about a candidate running a platform on racism wouldnt make it past the primaries but this one won the presidency but sure keep believing it was a platform on racism and stay in your echo chamber so you never have to do any critical thinking thats why he won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice to see casualy racism on reddits most racist board
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,change reddit to ceddit in the url seems the mods are deleting anything they disagree with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre an idiot quit sucking yezzys dick gay boi
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,calling black people super predators isnt genuine racism im not trying to troll anybody but the clintons have done far worse for blacks in the united states then trump has

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck kanye and fuck black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,save him from what thinking for himself and deciding to go against the liberal establishment that runs celebrity culture it really amazes me how quickly you guys turn on one of your own
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these are the comments bpt censors they admitted to this in the thread itself people dont want to see their heroes support someone they were told to dislike for a bunch of bullshit reasons a month ago kanye was real spoke his mind was a rich independent entrepreneur who was leading free and open thought pushing talent moving boundaries now hes a sellout or maybe hes just smart enough and willing enough to give it all a shot elon musk just joined trump i guess an innovation genius is awful too upvotes this sub is trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if some tweeted white excellence oh lord
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut the fuck up already stop making everything political acting like its a shock that things get political when you post and love posts that criticize white people im not white so you cant blame me of being part of the problem but stop being so fucking sensitive its fucking blackpeopletwitter not rpolitics nobody is here for your bullshit so stop lowering the quality of this sub with your bullshit you fucking pussy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,harambe is dead fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,check out the sub rbandouchebagsandsjws the mods here made it to the ban list
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive heard black people have been jumped for supporting trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean reciting something loudly in an enclosed room is abnormal behavior id assume the recitation would be in a different language so thats adding confusion to what is already either fear or mild annoyance then we have the context of over a decade of violent attacks purpatrated by fundamentalist nutjobs who use the source material as their calling card so yeah no if you get tackled stabbed arrested or otherwise understand that youre basically shouting fire in a movie theatre those people arent exceptional wusses theyre just not taking a chance on person vs a whole plane full of people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mladys first rig from your other post you dumbass go hate somewhere else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait if nobody is going to think that youre commiting a terrorist attack then whats the point in trying it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she cute in an ugly sort of way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the thing is statistically a muslim reciting the quran in a public place is times more likely to blow himself up than trying to prevent harm look at it like a sane person religious obviously insane muslim taught from a young age that heaven comes from killing happy white people its kind of obvious that normal people get a bit worried when you go off with your terrorist chants dont you think
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because all those motherfuckers dont have the slightest bit of courtesy and just fuckin mad dash for even a sliver of open plastic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre fucking retarded lol how do you even wipe your own ass or live by yourself youre full on pantsonhead retarded

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair this would be the best thing to ever happen to bpt you would have some actual repression to justifiably complain about instead of pretending you were personally alive during the times of slavery the memes would be lit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats cuz the white people got jobs to go to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can understand the paranoia from hispanics and muslims but i honestly dont know where the black community paranoia came from people do know that the executive branch is very limited in its power and that between congress the supreme court and the constitution he would never be able to do any of the shit people accuse him of wanting to do fuck trump and all but people need to calm down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but clinton also has a long history of racism also going all the way up until the election clinton and her husband passed laws that targeted african americans and she reffered to young african american men as super predators who needed to be brought to heel she refered to white americans as hard working and there was no way they would vote for obama the internment camps also only happened because we had reason to suspect japanese americans as enemies after pearl harbor and back then we didnt have the tech we have now to figure that out it doesnt justify or make it right but why would africans face that also yes white supremacists do support trump but that doesnt mean that trump supports them he hasny proposed a single policy that would hurt african americans gays hispanics and muslims yes he has but not for africans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and they employ people the best people from what i hear

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,vacation huh guess you didnt take enough racking up trillion more in dept
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but i still think hillary is a racist honestly if you mention hillary making the super predator comment about black youths which she later apologized for i could see you having a point because i thought the same but when you look at how hillary tends to change her opinion after reflectinglistening to her supporters i would give her benefit of the doubt while trump on the other hand hasnt accepted any responsibility for his shady past when it comes to minorities in america link me the rest of her mentors story ill give it a read httpsenwikipediaorgwikirobertbyrd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no one gave a fuck about you for a decade no one cares
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so i saw a picture where it was a zoomed out one of the inauguration at it showed there were a lot more people out of frame
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,almost as if people are more likely to dislike and not trust a woman or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,didnt he just finish a vacation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol unemployment is not lower under obama in fact its gone up significantly the only reason people say he brought down unemployment is because you have to be in the labor force to be unemployed and the number of people in the labor force has gone down significantly since obamas presidency downvote me all you want but its true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bitch you played yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol it was the most attended inauguration ever in history fake news but as long as it fits your agenda its okay right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hope she dies in a fire

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i wish this was true i wish it was true the same way people from hollywood think it is i hang out with black people every day who dont sit on millions of dollars play pearl pianos or have time to cry about issues blown up by the media because they have actual problems that the obama administration did fuck all to help first off all those jobs all of reddit keeps talking about are part time normal people in places like south eastern america are hurting just as much as they always have there arent more jobs in fact places to work like the mine my friend t used to work at as well as the pump distribution place and the air conditioning place more of my friends work at have either completely closed mine or are tanking ac pump this isnt a clap back this is an out of touch rich guy who has no fucking clue what its like to watch his friends struggle to find work watch people you know for years worry about whether or not their kid gets to go to college it makes me mad as fuck when people pretend like the black community was helped because of obama or like we have all these jobs its funny i never hear from anybody working these magical jobs obama created with his magic wand i only hear rich celebrities or reddit moral busy bodies siting that statistic provided by the administration race relations are worse creation of blm terrorist cop murders blmkidnapping and torture of mentally disabled unarmed black man selling cigarettes because its fucking dollars for a pack in new york strangled the fuck to death men shot for no reason other than being black feminist zealots protesting white people existing alt right scum mimicking nazis shall i go on than they have ever been and if you look at a president and see that hes black mixed race individual and you imagine that race relations or jobs are better youre the problem its a gross uninformed oversimplification that obama has created more jobs and plenty of people around me feel it every fucking day watching reddit say shit like this just rubs me the wrong way god fucking dammit endrant

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats the yams
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i looked at your history and found you are neither black nor white and didnt even grow up in america why in the world you think you know more about american black culture is beyond me but you do you i still laugh and kind of cringe when i see people refer to nigga as the nword the fact that you think someone in jersey is going to get bent out of shape if someone uses the word nigga in a nonpejorative manner is hilarious if a white dude born on the block went to chicago and greeted a black guy he met recently and was getting friendly with saying what up my nigga he isnt going to get a funny look what i find interesting is the younger generation seem to be utilizing the hard r nigger thats a step too far for me but im old so wtf do i know i didnt miss anything about your post im guessing what was missing was a valid response to me pointing out black people did the same thing and that white people in one region do it to other white people in a different region there is nothing worth giving any concern to called cultural appropriation in the us sjw definition or otherwise we are all americans we all take and give parts of our cultural identity to others with different cultural identity thats not going to change no matter how much people try and make it a thing or repackage it in pseudointellectual marketing

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we debated this entire topic in my literature class yesterday black lives matter racism black culture white culture and the n word too if people stop being stereotypical about other culturesethnicities and treat people as just human beingsamericans then wed be a totally different nation i realized a long time ago that black culture is hypocritical we cant expect change but in the same breath still call each other nigga as a term of endearment then we expect the rest of the world to not see us as ignorant as we do that and truly glorify bad decisions and an uneducated lifestyle a people that cavalierly refer to themselves as ignorant will never be seen as anything other than that removing the er from such a historic word doesnt remove any power from it and doesnt make you more powerful for taking the word back and adding an a on to it smh

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this the kinda shit that got trump elected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,falling for the trump hates black people meme lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rniceguys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,superpredators
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the type of shit that makes us turn our backs when there might be legit grievances
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so i should have ignored my common sense and voted for hillary clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he knew what he was getting into when he said this and he knew for a fact that yalls salty asses would stop listening to him and guess what he still went ahead and said it cause he doesnt care deal with it if nelson mandela had found all yall salty tears he could have bought his freedom three times over 😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,voting is a useless act imo both candidates will be or are puppets of the ruling elite i was confident hillary would be voted in or swayed in a close election she got btfoed so i dont really care because the policies of trump are not why i voted for him more of a fuck you to the establishment and democrats who continually just parade their nwo agenda for all to see but many wontcant open their eyes trump is an interesting character time will tell im not inclined to believe it matters considering every tool needed for him was left and approved by the benevolent obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay say a white dude made a presentation called 😕 black people keep ruining everything 😕 this would be front page of rpolitics but this is okay nah man you dont have to be racist to know this shit it is no okay regardless of race cant fight 🔥 with 🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,have you been paying close attention to the policies of obama adminstration and bush let alone world events
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its funny since she was born a man and not capable of having kids and the kids dont acctually resemble the parents at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,while black may not crack yellow does in fact mellow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you i give you legitimate issues based on the shit that the man himself has said and you still find a way to be a condescending piece of shit get lynched
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well if we are talking about new slaves the clintons are literally responsible for the expansion of the war on drugs and the prison population so yeah he did learn and decided not to vote for the woman who made new slaves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre telling me to pay close attention to trump his administration and policies but discounting that hillary would be in the same position as trump and that anything either candidate did that was nefarious in nature is directly attributed to obama and his years of free reign of destructive policies perpetuated by not only the bush dynasty prescott bush bankrolling nazi germany ghb funded saddam who went on to kill hundreds of thousands with chemical weapons made supplied and sold by the usa and then goodol dubya who allows implodes on itself lol and then proceeds to pass the most disgusting legislation for a democratic nation patriot act hope and change is elected proceeds to not close guantanamo although campaigning on civil liberties and being a constitutional scholar himself youd think hed be inclined to eradicate that stain of american diplomacy but instead we see a power vacuum left in iraq afghanistan insurgency resurgence enacting of the ndaa allowing anyone to be declared an enemy combatantno lawyer renditioned worldwide crackdown on whistleblowers whilst again campaigning as the chieftain of transparency killing an american citizen in yemen whilst taking it upon himself to drone strike anyone in any nation like yemen somalia pakistan regardless of the military need its simply unprecedented behavior from good ol usa hmm cant forget libya and hillary clinton who worked for obama and successfully allowed americans to die who did not want to be in country considering their real objective was selling weaponsfast furious terrorist edition and of course this being a cover up and ignored by the media up until election season where its suppose to be a non issue and what have you because all shes doing is communicating classified information through unsecured channels which is no big deal if youre hrc and of course its all russias fault present day the regressive left has been so coopted they dont even comprehend their own collective stupidity and weve now allowed immigration racism and many other cultural nonissues to dominate the psyche of disenfranchised useful idiots who parade talking points and fear as if they are doing themselves or history a justice as you can see there are a lot of things to talk about but dont mind me just ranting in the echo chamber that is reddit and bpt which is seemingly headed towards the dummy side if ive noticed anything in mod behavior and posts recently celebrities the media obama your favorite rapper they aint on your side fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,really though assuming shes racist because of who she voted for her skin color is a little wrong no
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary wouldve increased drug sentences and prison farms because she profits from it but none of you niggas will give a shit until you locked up and become new slaves
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no one should get run over ever but maybe if you stand in the middle of a freeway you have that shit coming
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spotify its way better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id just like to point out that nothing trump has said is inherently racist or sexist clinton called black men superpredators is that racist if trump said it of course it is but clinton was being descriptive and outlining a reality of black americans yet thats ok and everything trump says is not i dont read their content and all i did was scan the bolded headlines within the article but every example cited is not racism and if you think so youre an idiot in my opinion sexism we live in a sexist country and sexism in general is an issue not addressed in this world thanks to regressive talking points of crazy hyper liberal sjws and feminists saying you just grab women by their pussies is no different then the vast majority of mencelebrities your favorite rappers who call women bitches and treat them like subjugates its the culture ours is poison and within context trumps comments are not sexist or cause for such rampant concern also idiotic opinions twitter the guy says a lot of things he acts upon his perceived persona crafted by himself media and his image calling his cabinet white supremacists paints a picture not equal to the reality of current dynamics taking place as far as race relations go you cant have black power without white power dont be mad when white people want to fight for their identity as much as anyone else some people dont believe the climate change narrative as much as youd want to be led to believe or be inclined to believe its as impending akin to vaccines not causing autism homosexuality and gay marriage probably arent as big an issue in comparison to the trans movement and what all that entails clinton would still be worse then trump you just wouldnt know it because youd accept everything that happened as the greater picture just like obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wish i had her big dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and if she doesnt say anything go on twitter anyway and tell everyone that youve been victimized by hate speech there isnt enough real racism to talk about so a good sjw should stage racist incidents to bring more awareness
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what kind of cunt eats honey anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ops post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,actual racist acts unlike these
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,google music
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like the clintons didnt devastate every black community in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but that doesnt target a race or group if it is applied unevenly towards a group then that is a problem with the police force being unfairly biased but not the actual practice itself and the department doing it unfairly or with prejudice should be punishededucatedcorrected immediately
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when is supporting clinton pro black that crime bill was fucking barbaric and hurt blacks the most the welfare slashing was their policy on day in and went way beyond what the republicans were proposing it was fucking devastating not to mention the mass incarceration of blacks incentiviised by prison privatisation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people need to stop directly focusing on racism because its america and it exists and always will exist he was saying essentially how we need to prosper and overcome it and stop letting it affect so many of us exactly he said hes still pro blm gay marriage pro womens rights etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol fuck off he goes out of his way to care for his fans and does massive charitable work the clintons have done nothing beside destroy black communities and mass incarcerate a generation of black men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,play stupid games win stupid prizes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the clintons were the worst thing that happened to black communities its fucking ignorant and bullshit that any rappers would endorse her after the crime bill that destroyed every black community and mass incarcerated a generation of men
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking over the same fans that made that bitch famous the only people who fucked over minorities and the black community were the clintons in the its ignroant bullshit to give them a free pass after the crime bill they mass incarcerated a generation of young black men they destroyed almost every black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how can you give the clintons a free pass on the crime bill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,vote for me its not like things can get worse hes right the clintons are the ones who destroyed black america how ignorant are you people that you can forgive them for the crime bill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,picture of a black guy and the caption is he looks older white lady comments seconds away from trying to mug me wouldnt that be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you arguing that the crime bill didnt completely devastate black communities how fucking ridiculous and ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a racist ass sub

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair blacks use the n word more than whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do people go around saying this i live in a town that is like black in the deep south and i havent ever heard it i mean im sure it happens but it doesnt seem like some kind of epidemic also the racism flows both ways but all of the reasonable people get along just fine unfortunately stupid people exist everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wont somebody please think of the white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are more racist blacks in america than racist whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was publicly ostracized by his whole county for supporting them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i said blacks not african americans wikipedia points out that around non african american blacks identify as their actual ethnicity ie carribean and how else are you supposed to measure what comes across as racism how do you establish concrete boundaries between what should and shouldnt be considered racist its impossible the most comprehensive way to measure this would be to look at public opinion the fact that blacks in the study actually said theyre more racist than whites should be a good enough identifier
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its because of people like you that race relations are so fucking shitty these days reflect on this remark because you know it isnt true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is in your post history so maybe you are just that dumb white people these days seriously ignoring trump for half a second hillary is a disgusting person who would be under federal charges right now if her last name wasnt clinton the ctr shilling is going crazy at the moment because i refuse to believe people have come around this hard on clinton especially with the support bernie had around here before and clintons rigging of the dnc primary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so klay thompson is white huh about as white as obama i guess mr robot is white too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not racist its just stupid stupid and racist tend to go together which youve proven in short order
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,neighborino
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was probably a black person that called him that i am sure this fine upstanding young man never uses racial slur against other races
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well we know you better than they do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the important part of that moment is the australian
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tru dat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,waaaaaah vicitim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,called the n word by another nigga shiiit lets be real
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well he did suggest he use his gloves or use the other hand because they only had one pair or something like that strongly supported what they did and wore a pin in support on the stand they all remained life long friends and the americans were both pallbearers at his funeral he wasnt the main story but he was not an afterthought either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rniceguys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she was probably being a self centered ape thus the n word was used
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably by another black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my nigga missed out on that caramel skin tone most mix folk get he just a bit too light out here looking like there a little too much cool whip in the chocolate pudding

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not american thats funny because you sure seem to spend most of your time talking about american whites that and trying to comment on porn is the same way someone in congo is different to someone in new york did you have to look that country up enjoy your ignorant life mr i have to post my insecurities on an internet forum he says after trying to insert his own racism into a conversation about cultural tendencies instead of racist ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes people are free to be racist in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope my parents are congolese and moroccan yeah where do you live
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol its pathetic you dont believe in the constituinal rights of americans by the way next time you ask yourself why youre such a fuck up in life just look here and remember that its not your fault that youre black but it is your fault that youre a failure in life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well theres no way im gonna prove to you where i live and where i am that youll accept so have fun on your alabama farm be careful about fucking your cousin though i know its your culture but it has harmful effects on kids

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well yeah blacks call each other niggas all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she could go anywhere in the world and find someone who not like her for some stereotypical silly reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,welp guess i cant really feel bad for her i mean black folks everywhere constantly throw around the n word
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol fat hoe just made that story up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks are professional victims
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats called xenophobia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ironic that this kind of person would be against black sterotyping but then stereotypes an entire country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,baked into our dna right next to child beauty pagents and keynesian economics ill put that right next to the gene for likes battlefield but not cod you even know what social constructs are theyre not set in stone cause guess what tons of people do not partake in any sort of tribalism its an ingroup outgroup mentality and yes people can work past it or simply not learn to think like that at all of course theres backlash but the alternative is constant discrimination and prejudice towards minority groups and that shits not okay fucking hell man you wanna end up on rbadbiology keep making terrible naturalist arguments about our dna that you clearly dont understand
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do africans poop on sidewalks this is new to me

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well if they said it in the movie it must be true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah its freedom of speech you kinda believe in it or you dont do you honestly think that richard spencer is at some sort of forefront of white supremacy ridiculous hes a bigot but a moderate bigot by that same principle blm the us socialist party even liberal feminists should be assaulted in the name of protecting hypothetical victims in the future from hypothetical acts of violence committed by hypothetical supporters of their movements which obviously we shouldnt do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,said this white ass sub

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when i arrived in lackland for air force basic they had us sit outside and get berated by an old crusty civilian guy hey faggot tell your boyfriend to put on his jacket you boys fucked up then they ushered us unto an extremely hot building and had us keep our coats on while they processed us one at a time one black kid had enough of it and told them to stop yelling at him they told him he was government property and to do as told it escalated until he was thrown on the floor face down with military dogs barking at him right in front of us as they led him away in cuffs he was crying and saying it was against the law to do this the security forces guy laughed at him at said you signed on the dotted line didnt you it was quite sobering

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whitest title ive ever seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,young thug is hella lame tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white guy reporting wtf does curve mean in this case
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white man passing through all what does curve mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats dm this is almost the time im seeing this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i had to do research to understand wtf you people are talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet i cant say the nword i thought africanamericans could say that and if everyone is africanamerican here we should be able to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes thats the joke also giraffe found the african
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does this even mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well since most people are gonna ask curve to stop ones sexual advance its like that moment when you go in for a kiss and the guygirl straight up moves hisher head away from the kids shutting your ass down for any sexy time dm like others have said its a pm and usually it go down in the dms
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,saitama trap card this is why you arent getting laid bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,care to explain english isnt my native language whats curving also what does dm stands for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn its like people have never heard of urban dictionary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,curve another shitty made up word pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,eliw explain like im white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,says the white guy who wants to be black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf is a dm he sending her a dank meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,curve
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i had to urban dictionary what the hell curve meant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats dm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what the fuck does this mean slide in my dms to fuckin curve me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,curving someone is ruthlessly shutting them down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one day ill learn to speak moron and understand this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it means to debilerately reject anothers often indirect sexual advances in the above picture the man curved the girl before she could curve him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we only accept the classiest mods here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dms direct messages on twitter sliding in means basically there was no reason for you to dm them besides if you are interested in them curve when a girlguy pretends they are into u then they suddenly shut you down or dont respond
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fellow nonurban slang aficionados my best guess of the situation based on an urban dictionary search is that the male negro initiated the conversation simply to preemptively reject the female negros rejection in an attempt to make himself appear the hotter or to inflate his own ego definitions slide into dms to message confidently almost peacockingly so to a person often female through direct messaging of a particular social media application or website in an attempt to win said persons affections andor phone number often called digits or simply number curve to rebuff or reject advances from the opposite sex while telling someone to curve can mean to simply leave albeit in a more aggressive fashion ie to bounce back off or get the fuck out of here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but really can you explain what a curve is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to get curved is rejected he dove into her personal messages to deny her before she could him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,isnt like of bpt white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought curve was a very commonly used slang but apparently people dont know what it means
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youve wasted everybodys time with this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,edit this is sarcasm and im mocking the white users that do this the fact you wrote that proves youre white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont be a fucking twat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did you distinguish and sticky this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait so you can make fun of white users redditors for being white but we cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the rabble that align with drake on this sub you guys ever watch the wshh fight comps why are you blacks so damn vicious with each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats curve
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he submits some of the best content here tbf not that theyre actually his
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honestly this is one of those times where typing then deleting your comment wouldve been reasonable because you know it would be a terrible joke or no one would care delivery
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn way to body mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone care to explain to a white guy what the fuck any of this means
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people amirite thumbs up i am crying laughing fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did you slide in my dms just to curve me sounds like a sentence a slang professor would use
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real at this point i feel so out of the loop im afraid ill get banned for asking what the hell this means
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow what great comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why yo eyes like dat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ew
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,was she a white stripper
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,never hear about black people wanting to go into science or engineering only into sports or rap well to each hisher own
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he might try to bring little boys home if he is trying that hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes got a grill right not just super yellow teeth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the alt right literally hates everyone that isnt a straight white male and only the right type of white jews dont count
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,smart and funny get over it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so why do they dont like black and brown people black and brown people live in america and can be republicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cool thanks for letting us know you have no sense of humor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,educated racism scares da fuck out of me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how is this racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall still lost thoso
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,find it in my history faggot you cant because its not there go to the undelete reddit site if you think i deleted it you cant unlike you where kid diddliding is all over your history you accuse everybody of doing it but in reality its you that are doing it talk about projecting i reported you to the cia fbi mit lmnop and chris hansen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont want to be the person to point this out but ever since donald trumps election this sub has gone from funny to straight up renoughtrumpspam this sub has gone too political i dont want to hear fucking anything about political bullshit i just want to laugh unsubbing from this cancer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cause all white people look alike right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not your friend bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those titties tho 👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and people say black people cant be racist yall a bunch of fucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao are u actually implying blm is an organization for social good lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,until she opens her mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the sjw segment of the left has caused terms like racist to lose all meaning by their standards shes probably a satantier racist but from what ive seen she just states facts that they dont like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,from what ive seen shes only racist by the sjw standards she just says factual things they dont like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i get that its a joke but let the record be straight that shes not a racist im no tired of people throwing that word around to shut down peoples arguments seriously its just as bad as saying everyone you dont like is literally hitler
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree but being prettier than a baboon isnt much of a compliment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean i dunno if interracial marriage is racist against white people but i think white genocide is definitely racist against white people also who is this tomi girl i think im in love
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see what happened here guys one user asks for proof of her racism another says well yah know original user then apologizes for asking in the first place this is why you think everybody is a racist because you can label without consequence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,comparing two groups is not racism even if you disagree with the comparison you are taking away and stretching the word racism if you think that should be included at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how is that racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,comparing two groups is not racist racism the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that ones own race is superior stop attempting to change a word to fit your narrative do you have any actual examples of racism or are you going to keep changing definitions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,comparing groups is not racism i have linked the definition of racism in this thread feel free to find it in my comment history notice that the word racism has an actual definition and requirements to fit that definition you can not just say something is racist because you feel like it is wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do one with black people ill wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet i havent seen one comment here explaining how shes racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so youre ok with people making accusations without backing up those accusations
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in many ways they want black supremacy rather than equality so in that way yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes gotta be racist shes white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the women on the right still have enough self respect to take care of themselves the left has a monopoly on feminist accept me for who i am whales and white knight males telling them its ok to let yourself go
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no need to figure it out just call every white republican racist with or without proof and then act bewildered when you are asked for said proof 👍
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxjpwivzlom members of one group kkk also being a member of a separate group trump supporters is different than members of a group blm openly chasing people people and advocating for assault and the kkk can be relevant when theyre rioting assaulting and destroying property or doing anything at all other than being a boogeyman thats constantly referenced really
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everybody is racist to not be racist is to be blind or retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone i disagree with is a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because he is racist and doesnt see white people as people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are correct putting someone on the spot on national television with racially charged loaded question is the true test of racism we got her guys case closed 👍
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm to the kkk weird comparasion could you list all the murders and beatings that kkk has done lets say in a last years and also property they have destroyed then lets look what blm has done its so clear who the real bad guys are but the media has poisoned peoples minds
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its about how funny this could be with black people or asians this one is funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except dad was paying the bills and mom was just oh wait nevermind this is black people twitter there are no working fathers here lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i remember when bpt was funny and i didnt see shitty politics pop up and always being posted by mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not kkk do you really wanna start to talk about white on black and black on white violent crime stats
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if i march in the streets people say im a thug if i go out and i protest people say that its a riot if i bend down on one knee then its not what is the right way you need to google what a loaded question is if you dont think thats exactly how he framed it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay but you are factually incorrect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im gonna give my kanye best
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahatotally

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop pretending like trumps entire campaign is based on race trump is verbally critical off tpp nafta and our position in nato all of which are stagnating wages outsourcing jobs and increasing our national debt not to mention his stance on the syrian civil war is far less interventionist than hillary clintons hillary is a voice for wallstreet the banks elites and no one else there are enumerable controversies and scandals relating to the wikileaks that plague this women this is coming from a man of color btw
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt people on reddit pretending they know how to be smooth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please list ways you can slide with better than building a wall guess what you cant also personally im not a trump supporter per se but his opponent was the one calling black men super predators so hes not the only racist in the race we can only hope gary wins new mexico mcmullin wins utah and it goes to the hor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this whole post is about being butthurt that someone supports trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more than double the number of whites are killed by police than blacks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im asking because there arent better ways and to say that is a blatant lie im all for discussion but making things up and using false facts like hillary supports love to do isnt very honorable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its called the kinsey scale
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,straight trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont even bother you cant win here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no one here does polsci majors have a better place to be than neoliberal breeding grounds i really do just wish we could get a candidate with the opposition trump gives to things like the tpp nafta and most of the corporate monopoly bills out there with the social justice insight of sanders if they existed clinton wouldnt have a chance but we live in a world of binary extremes and either youre for or against left or right theres no slider we couldve prevented this but we have the mindset nothing we can do can help us weak ass fuckers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre the only ones making these memes its fucking reddit black people dont use this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just saying we all know the only thing darker than a kardashian heart is their taste in dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do kids get an automatic bye on everything
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the wall isnt based on race its based on intentional borders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay according to the fbi this of people have committed of murder of all robberies and of car thefts but thats because the white man oppresses them and they have to turn to a life of crime right this is why nobody takes blm seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the alternative is a career politician who laughed while remembering aspects of a case involving a childs rape kathy shelton allegedly threatened a woman her husband raped juanita broaddrick called young gang members primarily black and latino participated in the birther conspiracy circulating that possibly being involved in circulating the birther emails to begin with led a state department whose ineptitude caused the death of a us ambassador and othersbenghazi and laughed about the rape torture and murder of another human being gaddafi trump has said awful things clinton has done awful things at least trump will probably be stonewalled at every turn by the democrats and some in his own party whereas clinton will likely get a rubber stamp for everything she does luckily its looking like both will be one term presidents barring a war
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it definitely is im done with hoes hoes are for niggas that have too much time on their hands or niggas that cant pull any better because they dont have their shit together only a lady can keep my interest i just dont have the time or patience to waste time on someone who could be considered a hoe yup aint no hoes or hoe ass niggas on my team legit like that

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some people did some fucked up shit in the past and because i share their skin color i deserve shit from you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think making up a term like caucasity to generalize white behavior is no different than using the term nierdom you guys arent gonna get anywhere with rational people by being so unapologetically hypocritical
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tygas wack b tyga like the ham on a meat lovers pizza dog u know he there and u know he doing something but u dont know what he tastes like

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah my aca policy was one of the most expensive ive ever had good riddance its almost like if you make something mandatory the industry involved in aforementioned federal mandate is going to spike prices just because they can did you not keep up with the results of aca outside of sensationalist media it failed miserably even many liberals admit that wake up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tell that to the president who was the first in history to be the only president at war every single day of his presidency
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i could do this all night if you really want youre putting words in my mouth you can actually read my history and see the similar comments ive made on the issue there needed to be a solution for those who were uninsurable and i have people in my life who have benefited there are also people like myself who work hard for a modest income and whose out of pocket costs have increased tremendously we could all agree healthcare costs were very expensive prior honestly do you purchase health insurance or are you covered by your parents there are several options to achieve reduced costs for the masses at the same time such as opening health care markets across statelines having a higher allowance for healthcare deductions from personal taxes tort reform eliminating billions of dollars of medicaremedicaid fraud systems similar to how banks detect fraudulent charges allowing purchase of safe generic drugs from other countries use your brain theres other solutions healthcare savings accounts oh theres another one one more thing you know a lot of people retail and the service industry in general lost hourswages because companies cut them to avoid hitting the full time schedule and start paying health insurance just saying frankly we dont need use political label to discuss this issue yet you want to attack me did you know that the aca is unconstitutional taxes arent supposed to originate in the senate you bring nothing to the table and you cant put yourself in someone elses shoes you wanna join in the circlejerk because of course it sounds nice many more people have suffered than have been helped lets find a better solution because there are some fuck you by the way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,adios finally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,havent you learned whenever something bad happened under obama it cant possibly be his fault because he cant oversee anything but anything good that happens was obamas direct responsibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,poor job trying to crop out the black woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thank god hes gone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good riddence
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump slammed obama during his inaugural speech and obama was only feet away from him kinda like when ben carson called him out at the prayer breakfast funny good bye loser

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know all i need to know you are delusional if you really think people care what a hat says its just funny how easy it is to bust on you guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre going to live your life very disappointed my delicate wallflower
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive read it before and i agree with it for the most part i think black lives matter in theory is a very good thing but in practice it is used as an excuse to riot and loot by a decent chunk of their supporters if the movement gets organized they can really start doing some good
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm must want to stay on welfare and have their inner cities stay in ruins truth is blm doesnt care about black lives because black people be killing each other every day in chicago not a single lootingriot protest and not a single mention from obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,copied from another comment i made in this thread ive read it before and i agree with it for the most part i think black lives matter in theory is a very good thing but in practice it is used as an excuse to riot and loot by a decent chunk of their supporters if the movement gets organized they can really start doing some good
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol harness that energy young buck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im all for making jokes about the guy thats what i expect like the bill on capital hill post thats funny this post garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,saved millions of lives from malaria and aids oh whoops sorry we are on the hating train forgot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm movement is fucking stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black lives matter translation im a racist shit stain
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is a good enough source of the breakdown of demographics i dont like the term black as its very vague but while the blacks didnt get more than hillary got less black votes than obama did despite his wishes the other minorities had sizable percentages voting for trump trump got close to half of women despite all the sensationalist bullshit that feminism brought to this shitstorm people just want someone whos going to be a proper president whos not going to meddle in their lives and focus on more important things trumps not racist hes not perfect but hes a successful businessman and hes very honest if we wanted perfection well wed elect me a swedish years old guy over hillary my friends and family arent too fond of trump and i agree with them but they all agree that theyre glad that hillary didnt win
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and in the meantime they still killing each other lol yeah glad its funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre black and have any self respect stop supporting the terrorist organization black lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were you able to keep you hat on while you were rioting and setting cars on firelol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its hard to not call out the black people when they make it so damn obvious what if a white person said that to you its exactly what you said but changing the word white to black i have no dog in this fight but you sound racist by saying that shit just like white on black racism is an absolute thing black on white racism is a thing too ive lived in heavily black populated areas many times in my life and i was sadly fearful sometimes because of how fucking rude some people would be to me just because i was white i didnt chain youre fucking ancestors up so why the fuck am i being prosecuted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so much that many of them are even willing to pretend theyre black on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they spelled lies wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pretty sure milo sold hats like that lmao trump is the first pres to openly support gays the day he entered office obama didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youd just have to be liberal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey guys im new here is anyone else on this sub liberal i love the memememes but i wish we could find a way to stray away from them and push a more political message thoughts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and they say its the white man i should fear but its my own kind doing all the killin here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so is this sub just going to be anti trump memes for four years now

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,definitely considering theyre no longer cannibalizing their own kind i cant say the same for the left note that im a classical leftist apparently this makes me far right to the new left part of the reason why i support trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this sub going to be antitrump for four years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh like south chicago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,son you dont have to care about other countries because youre a us of aan your ignorance about most of the rest of the world is your beautiful privilege stay sweet summer child
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably the quickness of the black community to call them coons for building successful personal habits
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what was the voter turnout among votingeligible bpt posters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf post is this i thought it was about posting funny stuff not all this political garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like i think its funny too but this probably doesnt fit the theme of yalls subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i just think she looks like a monkey and i like women my features does that make me racist no i just dont wanna fuck an ugly black girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cnn said 🤔 already stopped reading
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,referring politics to chartoon movies and you wonder why trump won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mufasa banned an entire class of people from the land though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shiiiiiit that title game
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can someone remind me again what obombyou did for black people

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this comment section is a shitshow turn back
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fisrt two are americans fighting foreign enemies last is an american fighting another american
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate that this has become a joke meme despite the fact that we have indisputable proof of both sides producing obviously fake news to fit their narrative is there a major news organization that hasnt been caught making fake news
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,naah i think we just went thru that with obama our first black president lol what a failure he was
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump is a win for democracy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dad said the same thing but he went for cigarettes that was years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,housing market crash isis nonjudicial police killings middle class gutted ignorance of politics etc its been shitty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was kangz
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were a democracy i thought we were a constitutional republic weird
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reddit is pathetic right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ya pussy foreal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more about the very positive general reaction of this being ok and even encouraged rather than the fact that he is a white nationalist i guarantee you that except for pol if a gang of white dudes started beating a blackgay person you would be outraged and so would we as we do not want anyone to be hurt yet you have this guy that just said that violent protests are an issue gets sucker punched and the general reaction is laughing and offering a medal to the puncher and encouraging more similar action because you dont agree with him yes hes a white nationalist but he never hurt anyone and hell never have the occasion to and now that person gave him and his followers more arguments for their movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks should stay out of politics they base their arguments on nothing lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so what you mean to say is that the lion king is monarchist propaganda that purports the divine right of kingsmandate of heaven
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy shit drumpf btfo its over for him now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what is america now under obama blm destroying cities guaranteed murdera everyday in chicago people not working because government is giving them free money already sounds terrible
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do liberals reference childhood so much with politics you like hunting but bambis mom how could you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,leftists totally dont do that to minorities themselves though right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we just go back to the memes instead of blatant racism and hate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ya cause there is citys full of white people killing each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bro cnn has been caught bullshitting so much lately theyve earned that right to be called fake
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meanwhile bpt ignores all the videos of antifa numales smashing windows and lighting fires in dc for the fuck of it thinking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you just rename this sub rdemocratpeopletwitter already jesus christ
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary was a shit candidate who didnt inspire people to go out and vote she oozed complacency and reeked of the status quo only thing equal to far right would be a farish left i doubt its because she was a woman had some onle like elizabeth warren run im sure there wouldve been more excitement but hey it is what it is providing he doesnt get impeached trump will probably get years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thoses are monsters rights have you seen any propaganda in the that was the same things against the jews
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democratically elect trump complains about democracy going away
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as if anyone actually gives a shit later barry and michael
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,america is about to be that part in the lion king where pride rock became all shitty bc scar became king candidate you wanted lost
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but trump is bad so obama has to be the best person to ever exist ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump is bad right guys haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,chicago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is no reasoning with you tear wiping sore losing whiners
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah because america was soooooo great with obama in office right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,instead of randomly sucker punching people for putting a superficial „nazi sticker on their forehead i actually read what they say to understand what they are and how to defeat them because trampling them to death will never make their movement die youre just an americanmoviebrainwashed antifa supporter that is promoting genocide if i took your comment i couldve just changed a name or two and made it antisemitic i bet you also think that the usa alone won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its fine its just which is dumb and tiresome
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,funny thats what i was thinking downtown baltimore already reminds me of
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so much tasty salt from the kangz on this sub remember you was kings n things my homies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so detroit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love how people only love democracy as long as it goes their way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most of us supporters are at work ya know we are hard working individuals with jobs and careers we dont rely on welfare and we dont sit around in our parents basement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is this subreddit just rblackpeopleenoughtrumpspam now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt is pretty much one big groupthink experiment isnt it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,barack and michelle please just go away
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this subreddit is so cancerous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looking good trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people die riots and call for murder of cops white people die meh mexican die ok he must have been a drug dealer trump supporters gets fucking rekted i didnt see that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its worry and insecurity mainly from young people who have only lived a life lacking worry and insecurity if youre a gay year old person you have never in your life been not allowed to get married to a person of your gender but recently you couldnt and they are worried women who have never in their life been treated legally as unequal are now pounding at their tits that they will soon be treated as unequal of course none of this will happen however they believe it will happen so they are going crazy hell look at the locker room talk thing people who havent actually listened to the conversation are absolutely certain that donald trump walks around raping people despite the conversation spurring these beliefs literally talk against that also the locker room defense is a weird one but its apt have any of you ever had conversations with a friend where you just say a bunch of stupid bullshit are any of you human or do you latch onto any string you can grab and make it fact while disregarding the facts that being said insecurity and concern cant be belittled away these people might be wrong but they still deserve to be recognized as a trump supporter half the time i want to slap them and the other time i want to hug them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know what the southern strategy is congrats on completing the grade bro what you dont get is trump doesnt need to use dog whistles or whatever to get the vote of racists his opposition was hillary clinton they were gonna vote for him anyways this shit is as stupid as conservatives blaming hillary for getting endorsed by the communist party
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get back to work doing what time to start giving speeches for a pop so he can wash all that bribe money like clinton did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,national policy institutedeemed white nationalist viewslabeled alt rightredubbed neo nazi organizationliteral nazi guys only more steps and we get to kevin bacon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre the type of person still clinging to the idea that they were both equally shitty youre a fucking idiot instead of looking at all that they had both done that you didnt like why didnt you look forward to what they were going to do because everything that trump has done from november to now is exactly what he said he was going to do none of this is surprising to anyone who was actually paying attention im going to give hillary the benefit of the doubt because her campaign was to the left of obamas and and she acquiesced to some of bernies demands like a minimum wage you can sit here and tell yourself she was just pandering and that she wasnt making you enthusiastic but the world as you know it wouldnt have be drastically different when you woke up on november and clinton was the president thanks for your misplaced apathy jackass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,now apply your stupid fucking logic to voters in mi pa wi nc fl youre dumb as hell take this shit seriously you stupid asshole

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,give it up bro youre time is over
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats what theyre called escorts get all pissy when you call em somethin else like theyre hot shit or somethin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,your response to ululumeme is even worse ululumeme wasnt saying anything that wasnt inaccurate or rude or shitty or unempathetic or assholish he never said its not a real problem he said social anxiety is not a disease thats an enormous difference yes social anxiety and generalized anxiety is a serious crippling issue for millions of people but it does not have to be a permanent chronic illness it is not a lifethreatening disease that you get hit with and can do nothing about in fact its all on yourself if you want to get better or not no one else can do it for you and yes actually the standard proven goto effective treatments for anxiety involve exposure therapy and cbt as well as acceptance and commitment therapy dialectical behaviour therapy dbt and other treatments that teach you how to rewire your brain and challenge your negative thought patterns and gradually learn to tolerate the discomfort of getting out of their comfort zones and learning to gently expose themselves to the things they are afraid of so they realize that the thing itself is not whats causing their life to suck its their fear and avoidance of the thing and constant attempts to control their fear that is making their life unbearable people who do undergo this kind of acceptance and cbt and exposure treatment for anxiety do get better and start improving their lives that is if they do the work with a trained professional and are willing to put in all the necessary homework themselves to get better thats literally what the statistics show cbt for instance is equally or more effective for treating ocd anxiety and clinical depression than taking antidepressants though this is not to say that medication isnt also an important part of your mental wellness toolkit even still ssris just give you a leg up maybe theyll help you get out of bed and get you outside but you still need to change your automatic negative thought ant patterns with cbt as well as your behavioural patterns if you want to make any real lasting progress as someone who has struggled with generalized anxiety for years and only started to get some relief and enjoyment out of life once i started mild exposure treatment and cbt and dbt and mindfulness i know that ululumeme is correct that getting over anxiety largely comes down to continuously exposing yourself to what scares you in tiny little steps each day as i mentioned in my previous post but now everybody expects all their mental issues to be exclusively accomodated by others in order for their situations to be fixed instead of trying to take some personal responsibility in conjunction with proper accomodation to get better people now get offended and lash out at the merest suggestion that there might be something they themselves might need to do to get better and believe the world should completely accept whatever their behaviour is presently no matter how maladaptive and disruptive it may be to their lives and the lives of their family friends and people they are accountable to and accomodate them completely because thats just the way their brain works im not saying accomodation is unnecessary or that depressed and anxious people just need to snap out of itpull themselves together but actually as someone who has been clinically diagnosed with gad ocd and bipolar disorder type i know that getting better is not something anyone else can do for you and i realize that yes your brain neurochemistry or thought patterns might make it incredibly difficult to get out of bed and leave your house and go for a walk or talk to a girl or guy you like or see your doctor or go to class but that doesnt mean you still dont have to do those things or that doing those things wont help your recovery if you are depressed and anxious you may be terrified of getting out of bed or have absolutely zero will to do so but its still on you if you want to get better you have to take action you are the one who has to get out of bed its your life mentally ill people like to tell people who are normal that they dont know what its like that may be true but thats still no reason to sleep your life away and that still isnt a good enough reason for why you cant make any effort to help yourself yes medications and psychiatric treatment are absolutely crucial particularly for illnesses like bipolar disorder but those alone dont fix your illness the other part involves rewiring your thought patterns and changing your behaviour which is where cbt and dbt and mindfulness come in from personal experience and the experiences of friends and other members of my family who have worked hard to deal with mental health issues and continue to struggle with them the only thing that staying in bed will ensure is that you do not get better

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just wanna slip in here before this thread locks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wasnt trying to sound blacklike wat are you stupid nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont care either way comply or die not a hard concept
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no because when cops want to contest white people you know they fucked up hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts are often unpopular
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they always leave out that this is because white people are literally over percent of american population if you dont include white hispanics like those who have ancestors from spain then its still this is also part of the reason we have white privilege being part of the majority is beneficial white privilege does not mean every white person has it easy and that every non white has it hard it doesnt mean all white people are racists out to hold minorities down it just means being part of the majority group is usually more beneficial than being a minority in most countries the white privilege people refer to is based on strictly american population and race demographics there are always exceptions i probably had more privilege than some whites since my black parents wereare upper middle class architects there are poor and disadvantaged white people but it doesnt negate an over all trend of white privilege also overt personal racism is different than institutionalized racism which is on a macro systematic schale any race is capable of racism i have seen the white and asians bullied when i went to a majority black school a group needs to dominate an area or be part of the majority to be part of large scale systematic institutionalized racism this doesnt mean there is group of white men maliciously trying to bar minorities from jobs are there white people like that yes but they are probably much smaller than the ones who do it unconsciously the concept of homogeneity dictates that we are more likely to mate with be friends with date and give unconscious favoritism to those similar to us this could be in race socioeconomic status or hobby its a big part of the reason white people usually date other white people its not because whites are racist or hate the look of other races this phenomenon carries over to the job market remember whites are if you count white hispanics like those from spain this is what affirmative action tries to correct for but its not a perfect law and sometimes hurts white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you guys try to fight racism and then say things like how white are you this is why people think you uneducated af and aint worth respect lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah let me just stop being white and start being a menace to society that sounds like a way to have a good life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i didnt say that holy shit let me break it down for your noncomprehendin ass by be a menace to society i mean be black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you want racial equality you should consider not deflecting or avoiding discussionconfrontation about it no work will get done if you keep that us v them mentality
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fact that this rational summary is getting down voted says everything about the state of this whole thing good luck america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the thug that shot the charlotte protestor his name is rayquan and he has a gold grill in his mugshot this may be a joke on whitey but theres some hella truth to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn wish i coulda shot up a blacklivesmatter meeting in like gta or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone who actually wants to test it would look at number of unarmed blacks killed by cops vs unarmed whites and then compare that to the proportion of blacks in the country im sure this is about to be locked but the most accurate thin to compare with is the death rate relative to the encounter rate with the police you can then also compare encounter to homocide and other crime to see if that is disproportionate if police are killing people equally relative to encounter rate then the racism ist happening on the cop level its at whatever level causes black people to commit more crimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most of those are silly but stereotypes do exist for a reason sometimes theyre almost baseless other times they are spot on they generally dont just appear out of thin air theyre based on an existing template that embodies the stereotype im another white guy who has lived in the ghetto and you can be sure there are plenty of living stereotypes walking around every one plenty of gangbangers plenty of crack heads and every time the social security checks come in the mass migration to the liquor store begins if you think whiteys opinion doesnt matter just cause hes white youre just as bad as the asshole cop who plugs a black kid because hes black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude must be drunk because that girl is ugly af
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spiderman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,spiderman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone wants to be a fucking victim its a joke i really stopped giving a shit almost always turns out that the person getting killed was a dumbass and has previous problems with law enforcement it really isnt that fucking complicated to understand but its all the white peoples fault im not denying there isnt a problem but theres a problem from both ends

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i lucked out she looks hispanic but acts white of the time the is classic hispanic crazy i thought she wouldnt have it but shes does bless my soul
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in the sextape that actually exists i dont get why people are saying its fake just go watch it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then go watch it its definitely real also alicia machado was an accessory to murder and even threatened to kill the judge so i dont get why people are defending this piece of trash just watch her sextape its there just watch it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how much for one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you do realize clinton was the one that brought up alicia machado in the first place right tried to shame trump because he called her fat one time years ago then trump said why the fuck does she matter sextape making getaway car drivin judge threatening fat trash she does not matter at all the sextape was real even if it wasnt intentional on her end its out there she does it up the butt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh i know facts never matter to this community i just dont get the widespread lies that are easily disproven but you at least gotta try plus when people get worked up by it then i get a good laugh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think im missing something but is the title calling someone an uncle tom for being with a white woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know several polish girls and the crazy is in them too maybe everyone lucked out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,harambe is that kid in class who keeps telling the same joke over and over and over and over thinking hes the flyest mother fucker there but in reality he is just the smelly kid that nobody likes who got raped by his mothers exconvict boyfriend a couple years prior

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ouch i have been clean for almost a year now and during my drug phase i was actually pretty liberal this still doesnt change the fact that you are a stupid moron who thinks a blue american flag is some neo nazi symbolism kill yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,goddamn you people get so worked up over a sextape and an accessory to murder trumps whole point was shes irrelevant believe me all trump wanted to do debate was talk policy and etc thats why he was ripping into hillary on trade and taxes before they started the but he called a women fat bullshit and attempts at gotcha journalism the debate was a sham
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao what where was the logic in any of this why are you people getting so worked up over a sextapethats real and accessory to murder tf is wrong with you guys oh wait i know
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can someone translate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you people as in the ignorant liberalleft who are constantly taken advantage of by their own party
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats probably because no one actually gives a shit what he called her years ago its all irrelevant none of the rosie odonnell garb stuck so they had to move on to the next one but again its all irrelevant thats why all anyones talking about now is the sextape and the being an accessory to murderthreatening to kill a judge and her somehow now becoming a us citizen thats the only bit thats relevant now no one gives a shit what he called her years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,really lame joke like thats the best you could do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ugh dont you hate it when black people stop being funny and start fighting for their basic human rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not really no one knew about the sextape or the accessory to murder and threatening a judge until she admitted to it on the news right after the debate now thats the story not that trump called her fat that she is actually trash being put on a pedastool by the clinton campaign
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist prick

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what did they predict that black people like bananas to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,come on rtheydidthemath lets get on this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because black people are worth less than an animal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you really are a generic gummy bear
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah its an odd combination of white nerds trying to act black and titlegore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he wuz a gud boi
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ugly and black 😔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im implying that this sub is mostly white nerdy memers pretending to be black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,opens urbandictionarycom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,quickest to make broad generalizations about other peoples racism black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is that how gremlins are made
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how black people arent on this list even though the list itself is racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha relatable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they forgot to put black people as number just keeping it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres no place for realworld views here if there were black people would have topped the list
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,simple just go over to rimgoingtohellforthis you will see the same memes that probably would have been posted back then by the same type of edgy teens
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cuz us white folk love feeling like its okay to be assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,strange how the mods of this minstrel show cry racism from time to time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,missed out blm activists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,niiiiiice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is the misogynist black man the first one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck this entire sub calling for an assassination of trump just because you dont like him hope this dumb woman gets screwed for tweeting this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know a white dude doing this at a black table has two outcomes getting his ass fucking whooped or permanent seat at the table no way tyquan im not moving oh really finesse is that so
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good story deshawn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait so a woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and rthatbappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this would have been a lot less funny if a white guy refused to give up his seat and kept calling everyone jamal and dante tbh this kinda shit pisses me off im not saying dude should have given up his seat but the fact that he instantly turned it blackwhite makes me say hes the asshole in the situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well at that point what happens you get attacked and they get expelled
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappended
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no you dont understand its one thing to call for the assassination of political foes spew hatred wherever he pleases destroy economies you know normal stuff but if he so much as spits in the queens direction thats when the commonwealth puts its foot down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha this guy is being a little racist and its ok cause hes black nice right on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure thing negroid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he also used the word caucasoid if the races were flipped would anyone be cool with him calling them negroids
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,repeat this story with a white dude calling people jamal and laquisha and tyrone see if it gets as many lols im black before any of the white kids here try virtue signaling bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i believe we are talking about two different issues from my understanding it seems that youre speaking about individual racist occurrences whereas i am speaking about an overarching systemwide issue that is composed in part by the individual issues youre speaking about i appreciate your point of view and understand your frustrations a great article on this is httpsgoodmenprojectcomfeaturedcontentwhitefragilitywhyitssohardtotalktowhitepeopleaboutracismtwlm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some white guy tell the same story but with black names and stereotypes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut your negroid ass up tyquandaseehowitdfeelbonquiqui
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lot of racism and stereotyping in these tweets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you care about the stigma of the bat someone is using to bash your skull in a bats a bat patricia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not here to make friends jokes on tyrone cuz thats exactly what college is for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow so youre saying if the situation was different that reactions would be different thats crazy s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this race baiting shit is kinda getting old
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo this shit wasnt even that funny dude was just being racist and kind of a dick tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol i expected a white personal to get offended and say this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rich old hollywood actresses are all the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist im actually kind of offended yes it was his seat but does anyone agree he was being completely racist if it was flipped it would be on the news im just tired of the double standards with race downvote this i dont care but im tired of this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so black people can drop stereotypes and its all cool but white people cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre dumb as rocks for thinking he was actually mocking the reporter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,educated republican here theres plenty of intelligent republicans out there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre dumb as rocks for thinking he was actually mocking the reporter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre dumb as rocks for thinking he was actually mocking the reporter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get it whatd she do wrong would love a logical response
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they absolutely do he said he wasnt mocking him get over yourself do some research before making slanderous accusations like the left always do its going to be a glorious years if the best you can do is make up shit about trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats your point show me a news site that isnt biased
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plenty of college educated people voted for trump and thats just a fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man fuck you if this were a twitter rant from a white guy about sitting at a table full of negroids referring to them all as jamal and demarcus and shit saying he broke up the jackson reunion thered be a fucking campaign out to get him expelled from the fucking school the name of the sub doesnt give you any fucking excuse for being a racist ass piece of fucking shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuckin tyrone at it againi love it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,plenty of people disagreed with trumps ignorant rhetoric and still voted for him thats just what happens when you only have one other serious choice for some people all it takes is a candidates stance on one topic to switch over to the other candidate for example if youre heavily against abortion you wouldnt pick hillary even if you agreed with some other things she stood for plenty of trump supporters were not racists homophobes etc fun fact trump will be the first us president to support gay marriage from inauguration
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub has become pure race baiting which sucks because the other is 🔥🔥🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump not because im a racist sexist etc i voted for him because i have conservative values and would have never voted for hillary i couldnt have cared less about the wall and some other shit but i think abortion is a problem we dont have to abolish it completely but going balls out no limits on abortion was not the way i wanted things to go i also care about free speech and i didnt like the way democrats and liberals were suffocating it when i talk about free speech im talking about the right to talk about controversial topics not to say racist shit i also knew hillary had a shitty track record internationally anything but hillarys shitty track record of warmongering politics wouldve done it for me especially in the middle east im middle eastern so ive been following that stuff i also believe in conservative values like free markets even though trump isnt doing a good job of that right now i have no problem calling out trump when he says dumb shit either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please tell me who hes making fun of exactly in the other clips which diseases are you referring to exactly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reducing all people with disabilities to a single caricature of what it looks like to be retarded youre pulling this straight from your ass hes not pretending to be retarded or to make fun of mentally retarded people when he does this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah if you called a random black guy jamal or tyrone etc it would be racist or if you said sorry i ruined the wu tang clan reunion you would be sentenced to exile
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow easy there tyrone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes black and left the democrat plantation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems lowkey racist and by lowkey i mean pretty obviously racist think if the situation was flipped and this was in rwhitepoepletwitter there would be a shit storm ya know
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so a white guy can just be like what the fuck you want daquan you blackazoid and thats ok this sub is racist as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people murder and rob thats not a fucking joke its a cancer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is funny because in this story the black guy is on time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reposting piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i agree with dauan jackson over here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks obongo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more empty calorie bullshit translation he looks like i do

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,calm down tyrone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do i make this about trump you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who the fuck is janelle monet nevermind no one cares
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats made up is the whole meme they made to try to push their agenda that trump is putting racist misogynistic homophobes in positions of power they cant see that anything else they live in a different reality trump is hitler to them but their actions speak louder they just all talk and no action if we really did have hitler someone would have done something already truth is we dont have hitler and all those people in the meme are good people they wanna demonize anyone that is on the trump team which is what they have been taught victim cards will be played for about years its gonna be fun looking at these people try to make sense of trump making inner cities safer and bringing jobs to the rust belt this sub used to be about just funny black people tweets nows it has become a political sub thats completely misleading people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah right as if anyone could fuck michelle obama for the sake of pleasure

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the amount of disillusion is astounding here could this be step to irradicating muslims like hitler did to the news yeah we could go down that line but could this also be a way to better track all potential terrorists because its an absolute fact they move certain parts of the family in then move in after dont care about the religion of who it is or what ethnic group is under the microscope all i care about is that less innocent people die to terrorist threats if someone has to sign up on a database that says theyre muslim just like i have to sign up to show im american indian than so be it also much of this is already being done its how people get caught funding terrorist groups from other countries go ahead and down vote me all you like i have muslim friends and i know they arent a threat and id protect them just like family if it came down to it but it only takes a handful of bad families to kill innocent people were not looking to kill lock up or get rid of muslims in our country

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can tell youre quite an intolerant and intolerable being i never said you were wrong i only told you what my assumption was and showed you the data i saw to make such a conclusion i even told you that i may have made a mistake between atl city and atl county but the fact that youre projecting hostility by name calling and making false accusations shows me who you really are glad you dont represent the fine people of georgia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre when you get older you cant tell them apart like if you had to pick kusanagikun from a bunch of japs it becomes borderline impossible

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,come be a white person in a black city people constantly asking you for bus fair change money for mcdonalds homeless people only accosting you and only you because of your skin color groups of teenage black kids demanding you hand over your bookbag at the bus stop its real easy to see problems from one side only man im in college and a commuter and i literally took several semesters off to get my license and a car because i wasnt going to be stabbed to death or some fucked up shit just because i couldnt have a ride tofrom school
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,both sides of the argument are true blacks disproprotiately commit crimes and are also disproportionately found guilty tried and incarcerated ignoring either side of the argument makes you ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is no excuse to commit crime you do not get to steal because youre poor you do not get to rape murder and assault people because youre really mad you are not given a free pass to break the law because of your skin color or living conditions being a victim if you even really are is not a pass to victimize others
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im saying homeless people and random people antagognize and harass white people way more than black people in a black city thats also racism believe it or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the only option get outta here with that shit excuse that poor people use to explain stealing and even murder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes racism when people target white people based on their skin color for threadsantagonizingetc in a city thats racism mr upmmeurshavedpuss i am not trolling
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah im sure theres some racial profiling that goes on but im willing to bet that of it is either location or the way you act ive only been followed in stores that sell expensive things or stores in more crime prone areas of the state
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i havent had a mom my whole childhood and i lived in a shit ghetto apartment until i was or and my dad never stole or hurt anyone and he had to handle two kids we werent brome because he was lucky to land a nice job of hard labour but it wasnt easy only lazy poor people say they have no other options

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being the majority of the population and having the most mass shootings makes sense statistics wise what about the black crime rate using her thinking if we banned all blacks with a blackban prisons and the crime rate would drop significantly

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because otherwise im just fucking pissed that i have to worry about my friends dying for fuck all knows what how many people do you know that have died at the hands of the police versus being killed by criminals etc honest question within miles of where i live about black people get shot every weekend but all i hear on the internet is that the biggest fear a black man has in america is being shot by the police is this was people in watts englewood baltimore brooklyn really fear the most dying at the hands of the police im being honest in asking this because to me it makes little sense i get about being harassed by the police i see that happen but actually get killed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so lets dish this out if you assume all cops are unjustifiably shooting blacks then im going to assume all blacks are selling crack to year olds on the corner see how that works nowwill the suburban white year old moderator please ban me thanks

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh man never noticed this comment but i still have the same view as i did then to a regular person i guess im not sure what nasa has to do with this but they are my biggest piece of evidence they havent released photos of earth that could remotely identify as the same planet as the other you will find nasas released photos proves this way more than google images you can always believe what you want just realize that people who believe the same weird stuff i do dont shove shit down your throat ill debate as long as i have to but at this point i do not believe i can be swayed back into the norm every time you are presented something that makes nothing but sense to you before sticking with your guns because it feels right just think about the odds of that actually being the proper way presented with logic and reason vs a gut feeling only works so much this may not relate to you now but i can only hope that it resonates later as a lot has with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a rapist a fraud white woman and draft dodger you should be happy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just be glad they keep so many in those two places if the us gave texas back to mexico and they deported white people for the lols imagine all the salty mayonnaise that would spread over the rest of the us map
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as shitty as they are at least they know better than to not burn down their community gas station and loot and as a taxpayer funded organization that only looks at racism cases against minorities it doesnt take into account racism against whites even though they pay for the majority of their funding it ignores them for the color of their skin i look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character mlk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because blm has antagonized no one at all right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as opposed to the blm terrorist organization that burns down buildings and blocks roads if black lives mattered they would stop killing eachother
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the best part is its exactly the same the other way around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you want an award
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm has attacked people for which candidate they support and what skin color they were look up white people attacked in milwaukee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i swear to god every white person in america has some connection to virginia idk why
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sick of this black lives matter and white lives matter shit cant we just agree that nobody matters
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey man nice virtue you should signal harder next time though

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeaaaaaaaah
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anything but child support amirite
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes because blm says that blacks are the superior race and dress up in wizard clothes to terrorize other races
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im white and i think both these idiots and the assholes that assault and kill people under the blm movement are only causing more hatred and racism there are way better ways to go about this why cant we work together here its fucking for fucks sake
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so is blm they are attempting to bring back all of that post slavery segregation that our greatgrandparents fought so hard to abolish the only difference is that the roles are now reversed all these white people in this image are doing is trying to send a message that we are all equal human beings all of us matter not just one race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this comment is how i know the majority of people in this sub are white lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut up cracker
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just as crazy as blm i dont see anyone making fun of blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what do we want kill the crack daequan daequan lingo fo sho black lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy crap are almost all of your posts about hating white people and thinking that most are racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all blm wants is racial equality and nothing they have ever done or said has ever implied otherwise only a bona fide white supremacist wouldnt wholeheartedly agree with their ideals completely and support them entirely in all endeavours
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,now flip the races
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well its not billy who are currently creating race riots in the us just sayin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they should start rioting like the classy blm people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more race baiting i wonder which mod could be behind this

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seriously theyre as mainstream as you can get theyre less woke than a fat white pinkhaired feminist stereotype taking gender studies at u of vermont telling purrself that pronouns are the major issue of the century and white genocide is a moral obligation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did you guys know that more black people voted for trump then romney kinda interesting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats exactly right he doesnt just use it to be accurate but to elicit an emotion how you react is more a reflection on yourself

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it omits the first message drake sends where he says hi how are you attempting to strike up a friendly dialogue but is instead made out to feel like the only reason he contacted the person was to ask for something
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and yet black people in white societies have it the best than anywhere else in the world black people teach their kids theyre oppressed and cops want to kill them before they teach them theyre at an economical advantage for being a black minority in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,welp im gonna take on a lotta shit for this and probably not the smartest place to post but heres the deal if you live in america you sing the fucking anthem yeah shits bad for black folk and people of color in general but you sing the anthem because you live in one of the freest fucking places on the planet you can live pretty much any way you damn well please and the majority of people probably arent gonna fucking beat you to death or burn you alive on a pile of tires for holding an idea that goes against the government does america have a problem yeah but id take most of americas problems over any other counties problems any damn day of the week rant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess whitelivesdontmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,savage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,loving your country is racist gimme a fucking break
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why is making fun of ebonics prejudiced but making fun of southern english especially white in general is not southern us english is actually descended from a dialect from england that basically slowed down over time i cant find the article but think of a southerner talking times faster and higher and he sounds britisher
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not racist if youre stating something obvious when rational thought has been getting trumped by oversensitivity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah fam were all black friends here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah theyre was a trend going on about how it was racist because if it was a black boy that fell in there which it was they wouldve tranqued harambe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ugly animals

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im pretty sure it was more of the reaching in his right pocket for a gun that makes it justified
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did it not look like they were trying to subdue him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how the mods removed the comment this guy replied to and soon theyll remove mine too unbelievable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol didnt you guys ban racebaiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you actually think generalizations dont cause racial strife then thats sad youd rather poke fun at and ridicule white people instead of wanting to make change and dont bs me with that white people dont have struggle bs lol and im not white im just not a dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about all you racist culture raping stereotyping always gotta find a problem assholes get the fuck out of here stop coming here posting shit at the expense of black people stop being the racist asshole stating its just jokes and shut the fuck up

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i was banned and my comments were deleted because i said some guy whining about racial strife had a victim complex one of the nicer mods just unbanned me so no banter is not appreciated here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait wouldnt the son be a prince i mean if oh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people pretending to be offended for the illusion of moral superiority now thats just a wednesday
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he is the only man she need he is her king not strange her man probably dipped on her and their kid so shes filling that void by devoting all of her attention to loving her son
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rise above this racist generalization we dont need that right now but we will keep this one because it fits our agenda
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where are the chicago philly or baltimore protests against black on black violence that is the biggest epidemic facing the young black community
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes not still talking about harambe is he
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,scary game for black people job application
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cant tell if i found the white guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,humans are not an endangered species so idgaf when one i never met dies lol rimgoingtohellforthis i didnt care about the gorilla coz there was a baby whose life was in danger id kill the last gorilla on earth if it threatened a childs life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but see its not really about that because what you see is blacks systematically excluded from the legitimate economy and so they turn to shit like selling cds and loosies or selling drugs since this is illegal he is forced to do it in dangerous situations like late night in front a gas station so he carries a weapon to protect himself now if our society wasnt racist it wouldnt be that blacks were forced to do shit like this but here we are now the police come to arrest him hes just trying to make a living and not get killed but then he gets killed when he doesnt want to go prison for trying to eat and not get robbed and so he resists so if youre hung up on what this individual did or didnt do or where exactly his hands were or whatever you are missing the point entirely the point is we live in a world where blacks are consistently and systematically forced into situations where they get blamed for the police violence against them downvote me but dont let nobody say you werent told
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can understand how a racist would see it that way go to some of the funerals of the black people killed by gun violence youll find plenty of anger go to the stop the violence rallies and see the outrage just because the media doesnt cover these events as heavily doesnt mean they dont exist so be flippant about another murder i can see where your heart is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,try not to ban me for this i just want to get it straight he says white people riot when a gorilla is killed but a black dude is killed by the cops and its just another day now if i say black people riot when a felon pointing an illegal firearm at people is killed while resisting arrest but people were shot in chicago and its just another weekend would you find the same insight in the second comment that you found in the first or would you remove the second and ban me to me both sound like race baiting and neither have a place in a comedy sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh shut up
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rfellowniggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,harambe didnt rape a girl between the age if harambe didnt go to prison and learn absolutely nothing dont compare apples to oranges or monkeys to gorillas
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean an alligator cant exactly pull out a gun but fuck logic this is blackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tamekia boqueshia takeshia

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i will say black entertainment television entirely because its awkward as awkward as the explanation the chrysler marketing team probably gave after putting over percent of their marketing budget for the on just black entertainment television black entertainment television black entertainment television
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah fuck the donald im just here to point out hypocrisy smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have chlamydia if that makes you feel better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when people stop resisting arrest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and if you cant handle people commenting on content they see on reddit get the fuck off your computer and find your own safe space speak out for my agenda when i tell you to and how i tell you to we want you to speak out but only when we approve what dont you understand about that no thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you found the white guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,media exposure brings up the tweet count black people have a long complicated relationship with american policing something youre clearly ignorant of also your account is days old and most of your posts are on this article so hi troll bye troll
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice to see you forgetting the part where alton sterling literally raped a child source obviously facts arent for blacks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,zimmerman is at it again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean these shitty memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im black and i say that from what i saw he wasnt complying except for a split second at the end where his body goes stiff with fear and you see his left hand extend but it was a breif second immediately followed by him struggling again yall niggas act like every black dude is innocent or blameless bullshit plenty have been plenty have not been
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not as lit as ashton sterling
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the guy was a piece of shit in he was arrested for fighting with a cop and an gun fell out of his waistband also he was a fucking pedofiile sexual predator the guy was struggling the entire time he was being arrested and the cops saw a gun i would have lit his ass up too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets take a good look at the guys record several battery charges breaking and entry drug charges illegal weapon charges convicted of carnal knowledge of a minor failure to register as a sex offender twice so the cops get a call that this dude is waving a gun around and have to report he resists arrest gets tazed resists more possibly goes for his gun gets shot i refuse to believe this dude was just some fucking black guy cops ran up on and shot for no reason when it comes down to it cops will go home to their families and you will not when put in a life or death situation never mind the black people killed by other black people in chicago last weekend alone lets focus on this several time repeated felon with a weapon who was resisting arrest play stupid games win stupid prizes i refuse to feel bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see you just highlighted my point lotta people getting mad if you dont act like you know or believe the nigga was innocent huh thats crazyness i dont know shit now am i assuming he had it coming or did something to do deserve it not at all but not screaming police brutality before i know all the facts is pretty fucking dumb and doesnt make me an asshole or anything either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more white people die by cops and more black people die from other blacks than cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can confirm am asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was asked for his license and registration he went to get his wallet from his pocket and was shot by the officer you tell the officer where your wallet is if thats the case you then ask if you are allowed to get it or if the officer wants you out of the car dont make any sudden movements especially after youve made it known that you are carrying and if you dont think his race played a part in this youre actively trying to give yourself tunnel vision of course race played a role in this it is a black man who was shot by a white officer what are the statistics on violence in regards to certain races what about aggressive nature you have to take those things into account
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,about people were killed by police in the largest number of those people killed by police were white annually on average about black people are killed by other black people i dont see anyone here tweeting about black on black crime are we concerned with saving lives or feeling good about being on a bandwagon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,have a criminal record threaten to shoot someone with a gun have someone call cops on you tell them to fuck off get put on ground reach for gun get shot twice done get shot two more times sure excessive force but criminals are criminals no matter the race the only thing that i cant justify is the recent recent shooting with the traffic light that cop was a pos who didnt know how to do his job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought this was a humorous satirical sub why are we discussing real social issues here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats a huge false equivalency he was illegally carrying a gun its not clear yet if the cops knew he was a felon he didnt inform police he was armed while being arrested he was resisting arrest and his right hand was free though it also isnt clear yet if he reached for the gun in no way am i saying theres enough evidence yet to determine it was a justified shooting im just saying your comment is garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i got in one little riot and moms got scared
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am not buying the narrative you are spinning maybe stop blacks from being so violent against all races and this will fix the problem these numbers are from obamas department of justice a black is times more likely to attack a white and times more likely to attack a hispanic than the other way around a hispanic is eight times more likely to attack a white than vice versa this table can be used for a number of interesting calculations first we find that during the period blacks committed an average of violent crimes against whites whereas whites committed only such crimes against blacks this means blacks were the attackers in percent of the violent crimes involving blacks and whites how do these numbers fit the narrative are these numbers racist lmaof
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please ive already looked at your post history and its obvious youre trolling youre probably and wouldnt last minutes in the streets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont want what to be true httpnewobserveronlinecomfarmorewhiteskilledbyuspolice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,also the guy who shot castle wasnt white according to the gf he was chinese
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub goes to absolute shit whenever something like this happens between the racist idiots who say the victim deserved it no matter what and the retarded people saying things like all cops are racist and deserve to die this sub is gonna be a shit show for a few weeks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meh just another shooting the guy was resisting like an idiot and stupid cops shot him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone shitty did get shot though the guy has a criminal history and was stupid enough to resist the cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,really not surprised that redditors are shouting their lowkey racist catchphrases bbbut all lives matter yeah but all lives arent being killed by police in the cases of alton sterling and philando castle stop being willfully antiblack and acknowledge that race is a huge factor in these incidents if youre not going to fight against injustices sit back and let us do the work keep your white supremacist bullshit out of rblackpeopletwitter of all subs smdh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if he didnt resist he wouldnt have died your fee fees are irrelevant when you resist cops escalate ten fold
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone should tell jazz to stop going for the officers gun
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,odd that he doesnt mention the guy was a felon with an illegal firearm who was reportedly threatening people with the gun the entire reason the cops were out there was because of a report that he was threatening people with a gun right im not saying he deserved to be shot but to pretend the cops only feared him because he was black is silly do people really think that if he were white the cops would have just laughed about him having a gun there is real racism in the world just assuming that every place you can shoehorn claims of racism in is a proper spot is stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think this is horrible but i take issue with your premise that white people are trying to systematically exterminate your race because its wrong the number one presentable cause of death for a white kid is car accidents the number one preventable cause of death for a young black male is homicide committed by another black male the single motherhood rate in the black community is now in the it was at the rate white cops kill blacks it would take them years to kill as many black people as black people will kill other black people in one single year your race is being systematically exterminated but it aint by white cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah blackies still worship thug culture when that changes this stops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except it was a homeless man who had made the call to after sterling allegedly showed him a gun to get him to leave him alone the store owner doesnt know because he had dick all to do with it stop spreading misinformation this is part of the problem cnn is just what i had open but a cursory google search will show several other stories confirming this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rodney deserved worse than he got
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dozens of people shot by black gangsters in a single city over a single weekend crickets convicted sex offender shot while resisting arrest having flashed his gun at a homeless man who bugged him for change protests of all nonsuicidal gunshot deaths are tied to minority gangs but sure white cops are the problem im not saying that any particular officer was or was not in the right im saying that in a country of people a dozen separate incidents over the course of several years do not indicate a trend thousands of incidents per year that just might
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i cross the street and dont answer the question for anyone of any color doing shit like that not saying he deserved to get shot but youre not exactly painting the picture of an upstanding citizen standing on a street corner selling bootlegged media
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah police brutality and da evil racist whites is the biggest problem black people face lets just forget about the fact most blacks getting killed are by other blacks also if a white person gets falsely accused or is a victim of police brutality who gives a shit hes not making the news so its not a problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think people are trying to pardon the murder its more so the fact that sterling was a felon carrying an illegal weapon which he should not have had and was trying to reach for it during the altercation no sane person thinks he deserved to die
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,indeed black people have yet to integrate to the western world
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were all black here so theres not need for your logical debate you racists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the hypocrisy in this thread is real you sit here and complain about cops stereotyping black men as always guilty and being trigger happy with them and believe me i dont think youre wrong but then you turn around and cast a shadow over all white people im white i live in chicago im out there on the front lines with black white hispanic and every other race out there on the streets every single day ive had cops shove guns in my face simply because i asked why i was being stopped i feel the hate and the anger when these senseless shootings happen just as much as the next person yet i get shit constantly because im white because all white people are out to get black people because i cant understand because im not black and then i come in here and the fuckin top comment is a dude calling out racists while being racists his damn self ive been to protests over shootings of innocent black men by police yet when i show my face im cast as one of the bad guys simply because i am white racism goes both ways racism needs to stop both ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice cancer post funny how black people can even ruin a subreddit originally dedicated to making fun of black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you didnt read what i was saying the biggest threat to black people is other black people if you want data and statistics true observable facts thats the truth the left lies to blacks for votes you are a victim and only we can save you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr one incident stands out in the lengthy file it involved a wrestling match with an officer that involved a gun in the affidavit of probable cause contends that a police officer tried to pat down sterling when sterling resisted arrest and the officer ended up wrestling with the defendant on the ground at which time a black semiauto gun fell from his waistband the officer grabbed the back of sterlings shirt during the incident and he was able to arrest him without further incident smh the guy didnt learn from his mistake and is now dead from it the guy is was a piece of shit registered sex offender cause he impregnated a year old also was separately charged with domestic battery and possession of illegally carrying a gun people cant ignore his past and its annoying as fuck that his lawyer is trying to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yup people are trying to force him into the false light and jab a halo onto his head but the guys not all that innocent hell he has a pretty fucked up criminal history the guy was in this same situation years ago and lived youd think he learn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there you go kid the guy lived through the same situation in youd think hed learn but nope
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no the difference is when im pulled over i start by telling police officers theres a weapon in the car that its legal and i tell them where it is second if im on the street and for whatever fucking reason im in sterlings place i dont ya know reach for my fucking gun twice

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i guess you mods are gonna ban me then huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why dont you address your own people that are slaughtering each other senselessly before addressing all white people about a few bad apples then maybe things for the black community would improve instead of just giving white people shit all day africa is the first destination to the east you know since youre so oppressed over here

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bringing awareness and solving issues goes hand in hand people knew the legal system policing practices and judicial system was unjust and inconsistent the platform they operate on is solid but they squander any ground they gain with stupid protest sticking up for thugs brown attacking white people and blocking traffic with the funds being raised and amount of people behind this movement if they dont get anything changed its trash name anything thats changed in the justice department since this started how about decrease in black on black white on black black on white crimes have the numbers changed nope this whole thing is a circlejerk for the lazy a pity party for the poor honestly the first open dialogue and conversation started with kaepernick but now theres an athlete speaking on issues where hes blaming the police want this to be better ask more from each other ans less from the government

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,umglln when do you think this gonna get locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,crackers are white men that are too disgusting to live in thier own country blacks was stolen from thiers crackers was thrown out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre an interest group right what do interest groups do since you want to be condescending ill explain it to you they are suppose to lobby and work with politicians to create bills that goes with their interests i have yet to see an outline of where institutional racism is happening how the us is actively oppressing the black communities where cops are being taught to go against the african american communities of our nation if there was physical evidenxe there would be actions and bills presented on solving it just like what happened with private prisons but there isnt there are poor communitues killing eachother and cresting single parent homes at the highest levels since the beginning of the civil rights movement this narrative of oppression is a way to point the finger at others for the problems a culture has created the blm is a crybaby movement

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,olivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah and this ones full of the opposite
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,honkey here i really dont feel anything about the word cracker its kind of silly even maybe if a dude was being all meanspirited in calling me a cracker then id mind but it would be more about the attitude i like crackers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what no ive never considered that why would i consider that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh man look out guys this one can use the classic you must be an immature teenager insult your internet prowess is too much for me to handle

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rcringe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the black equivalent of this would end up on rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the general public cant help if his team can silence a story well its hardly comparable to lena dunham admitting to molesting her sister in a book side note how weird would it be to call lena dunham by her first name only
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im so tired of shit getting locked some people made nasty commentsgot offended at a joke so were shutting everything down because muh moral superiority
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its offensive because if someone white posted a row of black people and compared them to something they would he called racist although this is probably made by a white person anyway i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,line up a bunch of crackers and its funny line up a bunch of monkeys on a porch and its racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people are the most racist ppl on the planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist slurs only have power if you let it offend you for some reason white people have really thick skin in this dept must be all the pride
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but if i did this with black people on monkeys i would be downvoted to hell smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,none of this is actual history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i actually like that term cracker originates from old slave masters cracking a whip on coloreds backs so when someone calls me that it just reminds me who their master is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont exist basically this sub thrives on trying to offend people and when people dont get offended theyll do it for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of this sub actually
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but can we make fun of your guy without you murdering innocent people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,while i did enjoy these its concerning that bible stories are being labeled historical events
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in my superwhite rural hometown everyone listened to hip hop and would throw around nigga like nothing because its pretty much the perfect filler word but when the ultrarare black kid shows up everyone puts a lid on it so isnt it actually racist against the black kid for everyone to treat him differently by not throwing around the word because hes black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heh regardless of the past evil whitey bringing over thousands of slaves fuck those guys sold off of course by their peers the black race would still be dancing around a fire with bamboo sticks attached to their dicks if im wrong please show me a world country with a black majority

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats mainly due to the mentality women have towards other women instinctly women feel the need to have to compete with each other rather than gooutandget like men do this is a generalisation and doesnt apply to everyone its one of the main reasons women wear makeup to compete with other women who do people are going to attack me like no women wear makeup because they like to sure i never said they didnt again its a generalisation and a fairly accurate one anyone who has opened a psychology text book can tell you

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i got stung by a bee once and everyone told me to stop being racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i believe animosity towards that group stems from things like cheering on the killer in the dallas shooting with the has tag blm and interrupting a eulogy for the victims in orlando to push their meetings and not from a place of racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its like the soft side you put the sticky side on the ceiling to stop the black kids from jumping of the bed its just different is all im saying normal hair doesnt do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,facts can offend people mainly because bringing it up may be considered rude if its uncalled for blacks commit a high percentage of crimes despite being the of the population lots of people will find this comment offensive but it is a fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah because reverse racism isnt real and white people actually have a history of prejudice by means of blackface sooooo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you actually go to places where soccer is discussed it is still debated over whether messi or ronaldo is better last season the teams were only point away with ronaldo having about more goals and messi having about more assists him being a crazy good passer does not settle the debate if who is the better player

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jesus christ your opinion of the player has shit to do with his performance why must people start anything with dont care for the blank but compliment like does it pain everyone to give credit will we think less of you if you dont like the person backhanded compliments are insults fuck you and anyone who does this pussy shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i didnt say that at all when the game is discussed without people chiming in with the goal of getting imaginary internet points
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not because it goes against my point but because the discussions on there on the quality of arsenal players have the best asses in the epl just because there are many people on rsoccer does not mean that it has decent discussion about soccer keep acting like an ass though and maybe arsenal will sign you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everytime i post something pro islam i either get downvoted into oblivion or hear deplorable shit europeans who actually live in europe and get bombed more and more frequently by suicide bombers get sick of hearing privileged americans explain how important loving everyone is all this while youre living in a country that do everything you can to murder muslims

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cry some more
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,being black in america sounds like a pain in the ass good thing i live in europe im surrounded by pools bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow what a trash race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what people shes an inept panicky idiot unfit for her profession and she deserves to pay restitution and she was probably triggered pun lolol by racial steretyping which is definitely a big deal for a law enforcement officer carrying a gun but theres not much evidence to support the idea that she intentionally killed the guy out of malice hence the distinction between manslaughter and murder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes how do you people not know this its the crux of your vendetta
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all those foods mcdonalds why african americans genetically predisposed to hypertension and heart disease

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats how you get bullied
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we dont like white people they um aaaaa fuck up chicken for one which should be a federal offense while my niggas getting locked up for a half these muthafuckas got the grill going with no pepper
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because black people can enjoy weirdness from other black people even uncle leeroy who is an actual crackhead but white people weirdness is something that they can always look at with a smug sense of superiority

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where is the funny part
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black on black crime makes up of all violent crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the national anthem to me represents the exact opposite of that it represents obama mlk jfk abraham lincoln to me and last time this type of shit got on the frontpage were upvoting shit like fuck this entire country tear it all down cam is a fucking houseslave seriously though fuck whitey dragging a veteran through the mud for opposing kaepernick with shit like i hope he loses his legs again and encouraging violent rioting when it only really ravages black community yall want me to take this subreddit seriously stop acting like trump with his populist mob mentality shit stop fueling everything with fucking hate and stop staying you wanna tear down the entire country burn down black communities i swear i look to the right i see trump and his angry mob wanting to burn everything down i look to the left i see yall and your angry mob wanting to burn everything down i hope to god clinton wins obamas direction holds together because if she doesnt obamas whole legacy is trashed and a monster like trump gets into office people with yalls mentality put him there one way or another and yall can fuck off for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is a race issue and the problems underlying it need to be addressed we need to go together as a nation to fix that but everytime this shit gets posted people start upvoting others who stereotype white people as basically oppressive scum start saying the nation has done nothing for them saying we should tear it down start mocking veterans who oppose protesting the national anthem in itself by saying they should lose their legs again and on top of it all encouraging riots that only really hurt black communities yall aint much different from trump his angry mob just the leftist version of it and i sure as fuck aint ever ever going to support him so dont expect me to support the hateful destructive mob mentality shit going on here ill protest sidebyside with you over racial issues ill work sidebyside with you to reform the system but dont expect me to help you shit all over the country as a institution tolerate people who want to tear down the government or support people who want to cause damage to black communities with rioting

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so a few years ago i had brought a new girl back to my apartment after being out drinking all evening we were too drunk to make the beast with two backs so we passed out until morning when we awoke we started kissing and canoodling and i decided to go down on her this is one of my favorite things and generally will do it as long as it takes to make a girl orgasm anyway i head down south and pull down her panties to see the hairiest bush ive ever seen in my life not only is it hairy but the hair is very long and also messy looking kind of bedraggled like a homeless guys beard or an abandoned birds nest slightly less enthused but still determined i plunged in facefirst and started getting busy the taste of this beaver if possible was worse than it looked it was fetid and bitter and to make matters worse i had numerous pubic hairs caught in my throat which were tickling me and making me cough i decided to pull back for a second to regain my composure i thought if i pulled open her ladybits i might be able to have a better angle of attack on her clit i opened up her pussy to a terrible sight there were multiple lumps of what looked like cottage cheese dotted around her pussy lips and clit each lump ranged from a few millimeters in width to half a centimeter in size it looked like some sort of fungus was growing there needless to say i was fucking revolted and started gagging i knew that despite my love of pussy i could not go down on her again without puking my guts up i mumbled some excuse about a headache and not feeling good and fled to the bathroom whereupon i spent ten minutes washing my mouth out and brushing my teeth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i totally know what thats like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr the picture is fake byrd was member of the kkk when he was young but turned away and fought against racism you can choose between supporting somebody who supports one who was once a racist or supporting an actual racist some background is posted multiple times every day on mainly rthedonald but also twitter and other media it is used to wave away that trump is racist the point is to make hillary clinton look associated to the kkk but the allegations are completely baseless to the left it shows hillary clinton hugging robert byrd a former klansman robert byrd robert byrd a democratic senator from to was member of the kkk through the in this period he was heavily into this culture and was very racist no one denies that not even himself in the he changed direction to the polar opposite he changed to fighting segregation and institutionalized racism from his own words i know now i was wrong intolerance had no place in america i apologized a thousand times and i dont mind apologizing over and over again i cant erase what happened robert byrd is an amazing person who was able to turn from his original connections to something constructive from and after he spend a lot of time fighting for civil rights measures he was an outspoken critique of the iraq war and the bush administration hillary clinton and barack obama supports him it is no secret they support him it is almost impossible to imagine the united states senate without robert byrd he was not just its longest serving member he was its heart and soul from my first day in the senate i sought out his guidance and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom hillary clinton he was as much a part of the senate as the marble busts that line its chamber and its corridors his profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history he held the deepest respect of members of both parties and he was generous with his time and advice something i appreciated greatly as a young senator barack obama i would think this would be entirely uncontroversial but donald trump and his supporters arent known for representing things factually the right picture httpsiimgurcomkmxujcupng is entirely fake and very misleading it makes him seem to have been a klansman in his later days which is straight out false he lost his affiliations in the as explained above digging a little down it becomes obvious look at the light there are no proper shadows which is the first indicies if you zoom a little in httpsiimgurcomidxkrtbpng the head is taken from the very first result when searching from robert byrd which can be seen by the outfit appears to come from a heavily enhanced picture of httpsenwikipediaorgwikidanielcarver a grand dragon of the kkk who ironically is a trump supporter speaking of the kkk fred trump donald trumps father was arrested at a ku klux klan rally in jamaica queens as a response to the hrc kkk meme i made for the lulz it is a little unfair to judge people based on their fathers actions so lets see what trump himself thinks of the ku klux klan donald trump to distance himself from claiming that he knew nothing about white supremacists even after he was told that he was a klansman he refused to disaprove of him david duke later as a complement trump later reversed his position due to the massive criticism much for he tells it like it is edit typos edit made simple tldr in image form
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,by saying black lives matter they arent saying that white lives dont matter or hispanic lives dont theyre just saying that black lives matter its like if i said that i like i do that doesnt mean i hate the xboxone that just means i like the and yes racism is still an issue in the united states its an issue everywhere when a black guy goes to some cops when a hispanic guy goes south when a white guy goes to a ghetto people still have tension towards other races and it needs to be fixed but screaming and shouting is not the way to do it blm think destroying shit and invading pride parades is the way to equality it isnt sorry just needed to get that off my chest

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop voting for democrats that refer to blacks as super predators while locking them away at disproportionate rates
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh go watch the video he litterally body slammed a cop into the pavement he could of killed him doing that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you scared of other black dudes because the rate of being killed by a brotha is way higher than the chance of being killed by a cop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you fear black people because the chance of being killed by one is way higher than the chance of being killed by a cop litterally of cops will try and help you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh how fucking dumb are i agree cops should not be killing innocent people my point is being afraid of the cops is such a irrational fear and who the fuck is going to boo you clearly people care from all the riots and protests
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no he robbed a convenience store assualted an old man choke slammed a police officer into the pavement when he was twice the dudes size keeps choking the police officer and trys to reach for the cops gun
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is many blackwhite people who kill people all the time and never get caught youre clearly mising my point anyways obviously cops shouldnt be doing this shit but you act like every cop is out to get you when of them want to help its just an irrational fear to have
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea lol who cares about all the other races who are getting killed by cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these arguments arent valid because i say so what do we want more dead cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we at least acknowledge that this was years ago

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres no black people in this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought their fast twitch muscle fibers were unsuited to video games

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im just saying if the guy had a gun or replica gun that they pointed at a cop and then got shot as a result they deserved it ive seen videos where the cop clearly overreacted and did the wrong thing and ive seen videos where its straight up murder but ive also seen people get angry at a cop for shooting an armed and violent felon just because the guy was black and the cop was white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,caption in the picture should read black people collectively fucking up

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mass confusion is not uncommon in your race tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that shits racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah it could be perceived like that if youre looking at it with the whole parentage perspective but i think many of us havent been with black men because our friend base is mostly comprised of white people the curiosity factor obviously plays a huge role in it now from my point of view i am white my stepmother was black i was raised in a predominantly black community vallejo my best friend is black so before you consider my race a motive for my message and as fucked up as you may think it is the compliment is that for those white women that were raised to feel like there are stark lines that separate racial communities for them to want to venture out of their bubble to experience life and sex outside of it well thats the compliment they are wiling to forsake their shitty racist parents and friends to broaden their minds additionally i dated a black man in high school whose parents didnt like me because i was white the street goes both ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah more like white teens commenting on bpt after school
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why the fuck would you get an album cover tat on your forearm lmao

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stabbing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that hate cannot drive out hate only love can do that let no man pull you so low as to hate him nothing in the world is more dangerous than sincere ignorance and conscientious stupidity now there is a final reason i think that jesus says love your enemies it is this that love has within it a redemptive power and there is a power there that eventually transforms individuals just keep being friendly to that person just keep loving them and they cant stand it too long oh they react in many ways in the beginning they react with guilt feelings and sometimes theyll hate you a little more at that transition period but just keep loving them and by the power of your love they will break down under the load thats love you see it is redemptive and this is why jesus says love theres something about love that builds up and is creative there is something about hate that tears down and is destructive so love your enemies from loving your enemies i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character hatred paralyzes life love releases it hatred confuses life love harmonizes it hatred darkens life love illuminates it oh yeah sounds a lot like blm

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kaepernicks a house niggaarab or something though well he aint black nigga you get my point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the intelligence of black people is troubling
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the wrong forum for this argument given the downvotes but trying to tweak public policy presumably through giveaways is the wrong way to equalize a society all it does it encourage the wrong behavior one could argue that public policy intended to help certain groups has instead led to its decline the other thing is maybe one group cares to make more than another it doesnt mean one is inherently inferior to another
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao blacks in the us still salty af that the majority of us slave owners were democrats which they forget and bought their slaves from slave traders back in the we waz kangs continent from black slavers btnomb

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he stood up for black communities by shouting racial slurs at black players what a hero
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wish people wouldnt lump groups together like this ie white people it immediately puts people on the defensive and creates an oppositional discourse when perhaps people would have agreed with the overall points that are trying to be made had they been layed out in a less accusatory manner people often times make really great points but those ideas are overshadowed by blindly lashing out at generalized strawmanesque groups of people i am white and i agree that there are white people who make asshat statements like those described above however i immediately had a negative reaction to this post because of its generalizations towards a racial group of which i am a member if the poster had not made this a black and white issue in such a way i would have been able to more objectively analyze her argument instead i had the knee jerk reaction of disdain because i felt targeted others with less critical thinking abilities would simply go with this knee jerk reaction and thus we see the vitriol spewed at the mods and posters in this subreddit instead of any sort of positive discourse then again this is bpt and i shouldnt really be thinking so far into this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black ppl black lives matter also black ppl im gonna shoot this nigga fuck that bitch heep hop dee dop nigga this nigga that rep your gang and fuck the opps

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gosh banning people for speaking out is so niggardly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not confronting racism is capitulation of the highest degree most of the mods here are dont identify with the sting of racism so they dont care
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go back to the donald
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just answer the question ese
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can you please stop talking with your mouths full also hand me that vineggar
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how are statistics racist when theyre against black people theyre racist thats basically how this works the mods just dont like inconvenient facts there arent a whole lot of ways to spin the statistical representation of white on blackblack on white killings so what happens is in shit subs like this you cannot even pose the question of which race commits murders at a higher rate this is a matter of just looking at the numbers not a lot of room for biasprejudicewhatever bullshit but just like that an entire point discussion is prevented from even fucking happening its fucking stupid and dishonest the mods of this sub know it but they dont care about reality because feelings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its more like cowardice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no u
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he better lock down some of that cash before she drops him for the next new thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stats are manipulated if they hurt my little feelings

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude this aint rtumblr
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,furthermore just pointing out one statistic in vacuum without going through all the possible reasons why that is or without giving out a caveat is just as dishonest as the mods squashing the conversation before it starts thats the thing though theyre not posted in a vacuum its doesnt need to be that complicated show me a practical statistic that goes into all the nuance and all the possible permutations of a certain event they dont exist because theyre not really useful when you say but this doesnt tell the whole story what if x happened it just sounds like youre apologizing you shouldnt need to expand on a simple statistic like that to be right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah what kind of niggard saves on something so important like glasses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this has got to be the most quintessentially black trash photo ive ever seen bravo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a whole new level of niggatry

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,another brilliant test is asking someone if they think a group which is inspired by a copkiller on the fbis most wanted list and funded by someone who helped nazis exterminate jews in is a good group
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uchauncii we nominate you to suck dick to stop police brutality good luck soilder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you you can get out of here and go back to your echo chamber at rpolitics if you dont like the civil discussion thats taking place here also did i ever call for full fledged protectionist policy no i didnt if you know anything about modern economics you can see properly applied tariff policies can be tremendously beneficial

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,disprove that soros isnt funding blm disprove that he didnt help the nazis in disprove that blm isnt inspired by copkiller assata shakur put your nonpropaganda sources to work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if the claims are ridiculous then they should be easy to disprove even for a braindead retard like yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt have said that actually next time let people with brains assume things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when blm stop taking money from soros stop chanting about killing police officer and focus more on ending blackonblack crime which kills far more than any racist cops in the usa most likely ever will i will consider my stance on them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol than trump ever has while yall are worried about trump fucking shit up not like it matters either way

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea white people make excuses right like why would they do that we already know cops randomly shoot black people just for being black and theres no possible thing black people can do to an officer to get themselves shot look at all zero of these white people defending this smh their arguments never make sense like are you really trying to imply the possibility that this cop didnt risk his career to randomly shoot a black person because they hate black people in every single incident yea right those crazy white people smh lol wonder what theyll come up with lol smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i didnt say anyone said he deserved to fuckin die either there are probably more than a couple people that had no problem coming to that conclusion lmao weeeeeell if he did do something kinda sorta bad so im willing to entertain the idea he did something bad here too let it come out that kinsey threw a toy at someone in preschool or some shit and watch them come out the woodwork so you mean to say in relation to that kinsey throwing a toy would be a bad thing which would raise the possibility that he did something to deserve being shot no one would argue that shit wtf are you talking about i like how you edited out that mike brown stupidity sneaky little snakeshit what stupidity i just asked you if you thought he was innocent and i edited it out because i felt it was going off topic but you can reply to it so i can thoroughly dismantle you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i said there are probably people i know hyperbole mother fucker i was making a joke what joke where is the hyperbole you mean your post about people defending cops on weak evidence of the victims character you need to add context mike brown aint had jack shit to do with none of this so yeah it wouldve been way offtopic then why would you call me a snake for deleting it for being offtopic and yea call me out on it then deflect the actual argument lol

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its not using stereotypes in jokes with friends is fairly common if you are close friends and you dont have thin skin if they are friends and those are just jokes than its not serious at all and most definitely not racist if im going to be poking at my friend using stereotypes than i expect himher to do the exact same i do not believe i am superior and neither does heshe sometimes its just a joke and not to be taken seriously that being said according to op the target was out of the room and not in on the joke with that context in mind it was almost certainly racist context is everything

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,looting and burning your own neighborhoods seems to be working that and attacking every white person you see when it was a black police officer involved in the shooting milwaukee terrific logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah theyve been working on it forever and statistics still show it on the rise a friend of mine went into a coma for days because they couldnt get him to food diabetic because of the highway protest in minneapolis king had no problem organizing rallies sit ins and marches without fucking social media because people actually wanted change back then people didnt just talk shit people did things all the blm bullshitters want is to bitch and moan on social media sure theres a percentage that actually wants change and takes steps to make it happen the best they can but its so minimal it will never happen you open your eyes and realize whats happening isnt fucking working it never will until you get people to actually care and actually get upset i challenge you to ask any single blm supporter what theyve done in the last days to make change and i guarantee its facebook and twitter posts at most we need people to raise questions we need people to start debate but until we start voting until we band together as a human species rather than sects and races were always going to be segregated no one is celebrating diversity theyre cursing it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what is the of the crime they commit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,socioeconomic point of view want to elaborate because there are plenty of poor white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as youve said there are a shitload more white people in this country but black people commit disproportionately more crime as a total white people commit more crime per capita the numbers are actually close which is the point i am making look up statistics also everyone is mad when a black person gets killed unjustly black people just happen to think that every black person killed by police is killed unjustly it mostly happens in response to aggression you may think im racist but ill take my fbi statistics over your feelings any day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are more poor white people so there is more crime this is factual information why would i argue that per capita the numbers are close and like you said black people only make up of the population
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a distraction from hillary clintons criminal activity and treasonous acts thats all this is kap sat down for what he believed in didnt make a show of it and explained his beliefs rationally according to the founding principals of america i might not agree with him but i have to respect it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the best jokes are ones that are based in reality though white northerners can make fun of white southerners because their rates of marrying first cousins is much higher but africanamericans have the highest crime statistics for incestual sexual assaults particularly with stepfathers so its like ha haa bruhhh oooooawww damn we dun played ourselves fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,isnt a lot of incest that happens in the south with black families ive heard lots of stories about black fathers impregnating their daughters a lot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its funny how everyone on here is white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait so you guys can joke about white people fucking their sisters and not seasoning things but we cant constantly joke that black people like watermelon fried chicken have no fathers or education and are always in jail if you guys can do this i want to be able to make super tired jokes about asians where i switch the l and the r and say the guys have small dicks and that theyre only good at math if you can make such a lame overused joke about white people i want to make the same lame overused jokes on every goddamned post on reddit and in every comment oh wait i already do

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,after seeing how obamacare went id say hed be passing out grams of schwag asking for it and expecting you to thank him afterwards and if you dont want to buy any you still gotta give him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like the people who tortured a retarded kid in chicago while shouting fuck white people kids will be kids

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt make any sense we arent embarassed and we arent fragile either we still go to rallies despite being beaten in the streets by thugs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,even the wording seems so fucking fake the way he was able to fit the story and both the mention of being gay why would he need to point out to a gay lover that their relationship is a gay thing and a funny catch line about eating ass on one screen of a message conversation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh it doesnt fly with you good because what flies with you is utter nonsense good luck

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black bears skin sort of whitey gray id imagine like a bw mixed race person with a hint of hong kong kung fu master teahouse long time customer old dude with a goaty in the corner effect whereas what op meant to say was a kermode bear but that would hold the expectation that everybody knew what that was without needing to google it like i did and that not many would know that polar bears dont actually have white fur so in scale of white to black black polar bear mixed race black bear white kermode bear white you dont hear about kermodes because they havent snapped yet or at least nobody has named one elliot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt butthurt ignorant cucks they killed gators at a ratio of gorillas but please dont let that stand in the way of the narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people make up a higher percentage of mass shooters than white people controlling for population
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i understand that you imbecile just stating that the joke is fallacious and not actually based on current reality

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think its extremely evident that mlk would publicly denounce what blm has become not for the underlying fundamental moral vaules of the movement but by the actions the group regularly takes to achieve and further its goals they are often clearly the opposite of what he advocated for pissing people off and belligerently strongarming them into submission and reform is not a very effective strategy to win anybody over now malcom x on the other hand no doubt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the years of higher racial tension came from obama encouraging things like blm to block highways and to hate cops and no the bush plan was to stay in until the nation was stabilized obama against all his advisors advice pulled out because he decided to get some cheap political points and promise to pull out of iraq bush did initially invade but that was based off false german intelligence not american ignorance or warmongering
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black cops have actually been much worse to me than white cops as a black person dont think theyll automatically stick up for you because youre black they on the same power trip

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive had sex before
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the thing about identity these days society is starting to recognize that your gender is not defined by your genitals so by that logic does your skin color define your race its the same principle also not agreeing that genitals dont define gender will have you labeled as transphobic so if you dont agree that your skin color doesnt define your race then youd be racist just kinda throwin that out there

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,funny how you say it is a warm up when you only comment on the gsa gone wild you clearly overlooked the entire list and focused on a minuscule point that the author brought up care to comment on his enemies list care to comment on his pakistani droning scandal care to comment on anything i am assuming that i will not get a response for any of those controversies employment seekers are giving up that is fact i never stated that it was not happening before in previous comments i have stated that our measurement of the unemployment rate is ineffective i do not see the point that you are making here i also will assume that you did not read the jobs report because you clearly miss the underlying disclaimer of labor participation if you did read the jobs report you would not be touting it as hard as you are now and you are right that shit does not work with you logic critical thinking and reading does not work with you i agree with you there we finally found some common ground the no scandal bullshit you pulled is straight from a meme on instagram from election night did you not think that i was going to find out what research do you do you take memes as facts i will give you an opportunity to redeem yourself because your entire argument was quite pathetic you only threw in subjective bullshit no objectivity to actually prove your point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i saw an old man clearly suffering as he tried to get to a door i wanted to help but our political views were different fuck him political views aside if you do this youre a piece of shit no justifying this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i only deleted it based off of a users recommendation i do not like being harassed by halfwits such as yourself i prefer to move things along the only reason i posted the comment in the first place was because i am tired of seeing people yell oppression when the man has yet to take office and yes i believe he will be the savior to this nation trump has already shined a light on corruption from the media the political system and he has inspired the truth to be revealed and if that link was not enough for you here is a link to the atlantic that details obamas scandals the atlantic is a centerleft publication so i am not giving you a reason to cry bias note this was written in the list has expanded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,his campaign was based on screwing over a minority group im guessing youre say this because he is pro immigrant reform that must make him racist huh how about we deport the people who came here criminally and make them go through the legal process and pay taxes like my parents did hilary is also racist af fyi
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fighting hate with hate proven to work of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when your political views keep you from being a decent human tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like what
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rules even say this sub is intended for exceptionally hilarious social media posts by black people and as of late some of the shit is just straight political statements
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and its also sexist to assume the movie will be good because it has an all female cast come join team nihilism where i wont even remember this movie existed or came out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were not looters were blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate how the country is filled with all these jiggers these days

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone else tired of the political posts on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because theyre attentionwhores
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my flair is based off an actual comment that i made in a thread a while back
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so one group shouldnt be labeled by their lowest supporter but the other one should at least be consistent
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf u smoking giant lips are fucking gross
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i saying white people is racist whether you want to believe it or not not saying its not funny and there arent different levels of racism but its racist nonetheless and if you want to stop racism and advance as a species we really shouldnt racist towards anyone whether theyre white or colored
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are we still using that trump is literally hitler bit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but if we added a new rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey man dont you get it women are funny and smart say that joke about your vagina again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,every single person in the altright movement is a racist every single one not to mention that blm supporters have claimed theyre for killing white so i guess every single blm supporter is a cop killer like i said either judge everyone by the actions of a few or judge people on their actions nobody elses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck kanye and his arrogant bullshit he does nothing for society
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah like song

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not your guy buddy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,screenshots of black people being hilarious on social media it doesnt need to just be twitter but obviously that is best whats so funny about that i thought this was posted on for a second
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,coming from a neutral party the hostile lack of conversation is how dt got elected without anyone predicting it i wouldnt say its the complete reason but i posted in rpolitics about a week before the election saying i was undecided and hillary supporters massively downvoted me and called me a racisthomophobictransphobic etc that was the general attitude on both sides against everyone else undecided or otherwise ignorance will spread if we arent able to have civil arguments and if you dont believe me donald trump is going to be our president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so bpt is now just a shitty rpol now umm cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,alt right is basically nationalist republicans but k i wont deny that there are racists in the group though

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shaming women isnt a good way to protest trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she has a degree in stupidity and her husband is an oompa loompa
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so it took her years and ivy league degrees to come up with those stupid ass vegetable commercials impressive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,michelle changed cookie monster so ion fuck with her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,salty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ivy league levels of salty

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt ugly people are jealous of beautiful people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we stop being mean to melania she isnt the president elect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and only one of them will have relevance in the next few months
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obamas face is rmeirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy shit i might finally get to that point im stuck up over a girl so bad i fucking turned down two other really ok girls cuz i keep thinking about her we stay up until talking but at uni we dont even make eye contact and i feel like i always have to start convos with her ignore me i just needed to type this out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for a long time ive called the peaceful protests you see nowadays laughable when people peacefully protest you can tell right away if anyone actually gives a shit they dont by whether or not anything changes it doesnt you dont like trump good you probably realize now what the second ammendment is for go fuck shit up if you actually care risk your life make a difference youll be judged youll probably be put in prison but if its actually an issue worth protesting you should be fine with that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ill just ignore the strawman fallacy and address some of the points you make that i think are flawed you seem to think firearm ownership should ideally be for people who need it for more than punching paper not simply want it not even everybodys favorite shining examples if gun control the uk and australia have that policy and for good reason gun ownership can simply be for fun its been said before by a lot of generally shitty people but takingrestricting guns to lawabiding citizens wont do anything to reduce gun related crime unless you start prosecuting those citizens for defensive gun use which misses the point the major countries that criticize us and our gun owners arent gunless ever its a popular myth that guns cant be had in australia the uk or france when in reality some of their gun laws are less restrictive than those of states like ny or ca ever tried buying a silencer in either of those states in the uk you can buy one for under easily
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did biden leave one of the children he groped on camera in the office too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i might get sent to downvote hell but here i go the way umglln and others think about the election is the way the democrats will never see the oval office ever again the way i see it a lot of democrats are alienating undecided voters especially the white middle class those people used to be an important part of the democrat vote but now theyre overwhelmingly voting for trump maybe if college educated liberals didnt constantly shit on those people all the time and alienate them wed be able to grab some of their votes and have our civil rights back after the republican majority does their best to gut them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you fucking retarded you just admitted you wont listen to evidence theres no fucking point in arguing with you kindly fuck off and dont argue with anyone ever again until you learn that you need to listen to the other side fucking retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just found out about this i know the source is biased but the content there is factual thoughts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hows your puppy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yo do everyone a favor and stfu with your generalizations trump is not racist you for real truly believe half of the us is racist seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good thing i can understand what he says otherwise this would have made it worse but all he did was say pretty much what was in the tweet and i still dont know if he is talking about money or nsfw sauce as in porn sources i know i get lost in the sauce a lot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck the oreo lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh my i hope no ones feelings were hurt you poor baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it isnt dictionary definition racism in most cases its inherent human bias police privilege and yes horribly outdated police trainingprocedures that havent taken into account the last years of social science studies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah its facts quit trying to knock the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres your problem you value equality while republicans value greatness and achievement egalitarians dont belong in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why are you so afraid of being frisked stop dealing drugs stop carrying illegal guns and stop stealing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,statistically that black man is far far far more likely to rob you than any other race what youre saying is that you want people to deny reality and common sense in order to spare your feelings sorry not gonna happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the burning and looting is kinda overkill lets be honest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay here come the downvotes but not all republicans give a fuck about the wall muslims etc a lot of republicans couldnt give a fuck about building a wall they care more about taxes and money thatd be like if it was saying get rid of guns let whoever the fuck wants it on welfare why are republicans so afraid that their rights are getting taken away im just saying not all republicans think the way all these bpt posts are portraying dont get me wrong the post itself gave me a laugh and i upvoted it the comments on all of these are atrocious though yall some salty mother fuckers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate how political this sub has become
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah its not going to
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people on the left are delusional
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please please fuck off please just go away
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you may not personally be a racist sexist xenophobe but that comes with the package so if you take that deal what youre telling me is hey man i dont hate you i just dont care about you that is a fair point but try to put yourself in the shoes of a working class person who hasnt had a stable job in a while whose insurance premiums have risen dramatically due to aca here comes a canidate who promises you a well paying job with his tariff plan who plans to repeal aca so that your premiums go down do you ignore him because you hate his stance towards certain groups of people or do you vote for him because your wife is sick your daughter cant afford new school clothes and you havent had stable employment in years just because someone priorities in trumps platform it doesnt necessarily mean they dont care about marginalized groups i saw a video where people who were gonna vote for trump felt really shitty about it because of him as a person but felt they had no choice if they wanted to provide for their families
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,redditors need to stop acting like the democrats are a godsend and realize this shit can be said about both parties
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,build the wall send them back they broke the law you loser fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get why police are quicker to use force against us group of people who represent of the population but account for of police killings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it wont be a muslim ban its a ban on terrorprone regions just happens to be that islam leads to terror so they get the brunt of this ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop and frisk is only racist if the cop is racist its not inherently racist then the amendment would be racist because theres a possibility it could be used in a racist manner
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,will you have another meltdown please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is one of the dumbest posts ive seen on bpt so far
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well lets see stop illegal immigration build a wall stop terrorists from killing people of terrorists are muslim ban muslim immigration stop and frisk is unconstitutional will never be law why are black people rioting assaulting people stealing shit vandalising property because trump wants to keep illegal mexicans and terrorist muslims out of the country brilliant seriously youre your own worst enemy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it definitely means you care more about your personal finances than the rights or livelihood of people of colour maybe thats human nature but its still a little fucked up this is slightly off for many people its survival this is it many have maxed out credit cards liens on their property etc i agree with your statement in the case of people who can provide for their families and voted for trump for tax reasons investment reasons and its a shame because its hard to believe that trump of all people is suddenly going to start caring about something he has never cared about before he has been spouting off bigoted nonsense for years he only decided he was worried about the middle and lower class this election cycle thats the fucked up part man we as a country have fallen that low the fact that there are people who feel this disenfranchised that they voted for a billionaire with no political experience who dodged the draft as their savior shows how they have no faith in our political system
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is such shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,muh safespace this sub is garbage most blacks support a ban in muslims they r afraid of terrorists too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do people rioting being violent not realize they are helping trumps reelection campaign rant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you can justify any opinion by using google if youre a white supremacist youll find likeminded people who will tell you how right you are and how badly people of color are ruining the country my point is most people will look for police brutality videos most people will not look for a cop doing a good job for example theres million blacks in america how many videos of police brutality are there against black people in america obviously is too many but when you consider of black homicide victims were killed by other blacks that between of all homicides were committed by blacks while only composing about of the population in chicago obamas stomping grounds a city which has some of the strictest gun control in the nation is rampant with gun violence blacks make up of the chicago population and commit of the homicides im not saying im okay with it but obviously police are going to have a racial bias when the odds are a black man between is most likely to shoot them will gladly send you to the fbi website if you want sources
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,build a wall to help reduce the amount of illegal immigrants coming over is that a bad thing and no theyre not going to hunt illegal immigrants down and deport them as long as the illegal doesnt commit a crime they dont have to worry muslim ban that was only said due to the terrorist attack at the time and only until they figure out how to reduce terrorists from easily entering the us hes not against muslims hes against terrorists like we should all be as for stop and frisk lets wait and see what he actually does i think many people will be surprised at the things he actually takes action on although im sure many will say hes a liar even though hes giving them what they want trump is a businessman who can run tests and gauge to see what the people want hes a republican but he also voted democrat not too long ago hes flexible and is willing to listen to the people give him a chance
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont steal jobs dont bomb us and dont be criminals done now you dont have to be afraid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,african americans are also of the us population and account for of all murder arrests
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because black people commit more crime like it or not its the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people dont get this thanks to msm for spreading lies most of those protestors out there hating on trump are doing so based on misinformation which msm doesnt feel the need to correct ratings rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre breaking the law youre breaking the law no law abiding citizen should be worried about any of these things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe its because you guys make it such a problem by showing all this fear
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except for the fact that minorities shouldnt be afraid at all unless they are criminals or illegal immigrants
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if your a legal immigrant in the united states right now absolutely nothing will happen to you nobody is going to get deported unless they crossed the border illegally ok your making a fool out of the liberals in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,paris nice pulse nightclub idk why white people are so islamaphobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,equal rights democrats pick one republicans fought to abolish slavery the kkk was created afterwards to oppose the republican party httpwwwhistorycomtopicskukluxklan the amendment to end womens sufferage was created by a republican and a democratic congress fought against it civil rights of wouldnt have passed without the republicans robert c byrd d had the longest fillibuster in history in to oppose civil rghts hillary claimed mentor the democrats have been fucking over black people for centuries get off the fucking democrat plantation people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but facts arent racist immigrants of various races and religion not plural are committing a lot of crime im not american but european and were seeing a major increase in a lot of different kinds of crime and even when the statistics prove that the immigrants are committing a majority of it were racists for pointing it out why i dont get it what is to gain from lying to everyone and ourselves and being accepting when there clearly is a conflict and incompatibility between cultures
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how quickly we forget that the democratic implemented the the black laws and the jimcrow laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary didnt win because the blacks that voted for obama couldnt be bothered to go out and vote for hillary now they want to get up and protest and beat up people in the streets it would have been way less effort to just vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,which is a shame i get your point about trump winning giving bigots a sense of courage to commit hate crimes and you are right the same can be said for blm activists who graffitid death to whites were violent obama himself never said anything hateful towards whites but he has yet to condemn their actions my point is that there are idiots on both sides of the isle and having their candidate in power gives them a false sense of entitlement all we can do is hope trump isnt as terrible as we hope and criticize his actions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre acting like its because of race it has nothing to do with it just comply and you wont have any issues if anything you make it easier to blame the cops if something goes wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,liberalpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,waiting for your next stickied tirade
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democrats voted against women voting rights black voting rights and the civil rights movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,o no donald trump won hes gunna oppress women hes gunna jail and kill gays hes gunna deport those in the country illegally o sorry my mistake i was thinking of king salman of saudi arabia you know those guys who bankrolled the other candidate enough with all this i cant talk about this misogynist presidentelect any longer im taking michelles advice me her daughters gunna listen to some role model music beyoncé first both my legs go on the back of your head
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao its funny at how true this is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,logic is not enough for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of women are misogynist lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean like this fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if americans love mexicans so much why not move to mexico i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats wrong with stop and frisk if you arent breaking the law
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god damn listen to president obama and give trump a chance he never said anything about attacking minorities ffs during his victory speech he called to rebuild our inner cities anybody hear dave chappelle say the same thing on snl he called for unity as well and his skit on white people rioting was hilarious if you missed it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democrat is another word for free loader see we can both play that game
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stats are racist yes thats all the m saying thats all that needs to be said if the thread gets locked because someone says something thats true then so be it im white im proud to be white and im fed the fuck up with people telling me i cant be proud to be white so what im racist who gives a fuck black people are attacking white people for who they voted for and its not a fucking hate crime i wasnt raised like this it was acquired it has been learned lock the thread i dont care it wont stop me from saying blacks commit more crime than whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,um you can stop being a muslim you literally just have to stop believing a fairy tale how old are you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doesnt say anything about race rates
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,huffington post get the fuck out of here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes quoting mr strawman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if their situation is so fucked up then taxes are not going to save them i have sympathy for people living in grinding poverty and the working poor but i dont understand or excuse them for voting trump because of it i think you misunderstood my post i said people who are able to provide for their families and voted for trump due to his tax policies are selfish them wanting that extra few grand each year while selling out the marginalized is wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i still think he had no intention of winning and ran for publicity this whole thing was a joke that went too far
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im honestly not sold on whether or not weed should be legal although to be fair my experience with it is very limited and not all that positive the only time i really smoked weed was when i was was in grade i was being bullied a lot by all of my classmates every single one of them picked on me at one point or another and the worst offenders best me up every other day i spent every day in fear and in agony over the lonliness it caused even though i was only barely years old i frequently thought about ending my own life back then the one thing that saved me was my neighbor and family friend id go to his house after school every day and all day on the weekends to hang out because hed let me play his video games he became my best and only friend and he was the only adult i could tell about the bullying as our friendship grew he let me smoke weed with him and it felt great and then our friendship grew romantic and later sexual i spent many afternoons in grade getting high while getting my dick sucked by him or getting fucked but now that im older everyone says that what we did together was wrong that he was a monster for what he did even though he was my only friend and id probably be dead without him even though every time we did something i wanted to do it oftentimes i would beg him to suck my dick or fuck me even when he didnt feel like doing it i loved doing that stuff and i loved smoking weed but even with that he was a monster in many peoples eyes and in the eyes of many the weed was only a tool he used to groom me into letting him suck my dick so my only experience with weed was when it was used as a tool to groom me and i guess i have mixed feelings on whether or not it should be legal because if that really was bad then idk how i feel idk if i even view my experiences with it as bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats it im unsubbing this went from a funny sub with black humor and memes and to full a full blown unfunny unclever political sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,u a ho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this shit killed me but also it was clever as fuck the comparison between a man pretending to be a woman and a black person pretending to be white genious
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sick of giving black people an excuse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there have actually been several studies that show results indicating that while conservatives are very good at understanding and predicting a liberals response to an issue or situation liberals were far far worse in doing the same to conservatives most completely misunderstood motivations of conservatives my point is that leftists are simply politically unsophisticated and easily manipulated by emotional appeals simply put theyre like children who dont understand why things are the way they are why they cant have everything they want and they hate having to be held accountable for their actions stop and frisk wouldnt have such popular support if it wasnt so effective in getting dangerous criminals off the street so maybe if blacks and minorities would stop committing such disproportionate levels of crime they wouldnt be complaining so hard about stop and frisk policies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this whole sub promotes nothing but ignorance and circle jerks about how woke black people are i honestly feel bad for people stuck in the mindset of this sub they dont even care to learn its just easier to blame white people for their problems
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so are you under the impression that stop and frisk only applies to non whites you think cops are simply not allowed to stop and frisk white people tell me you fool what rights violations are there that simply dont apply to white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white person who respects authority
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf even is this sub its a just a white male making a political statement and putting a pic of a black person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha okay im not here to impress anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the wall is to keep illegal immigrants out of the us any country in the world would think that is reasonable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao your comment history is hilarious you come off as very educated and articulate in your comments haha seriously though you sound like a legal year old mexicanamerican boy screaming fuck trump on youtube
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racistsexist sjw extremist or have we forgotten the people who have been attempting to change the definition of racism and sexism to not include white males
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe if of all the murdered dead bodies werent blacks killed by blacks stop and frisk wouldnt look so appealing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not really he added white to race bait like every liberal truly if you didnt come here illegally and youre not a sexist racist muslim you have absolutely nothing to worry about youre all cucked as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so are nazis youre point is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont want a curtain draped bomb walking near me thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a fool of the corporate media what they call a useful idiot hes never said anything racist or sexist and youd really feel stupid if you tried to find some evidence for things you keep claiming because it doesnt exist of latino males who voted voted for trump are they racist no maybe its because they actually went to the rallies and listened to what trump had to say instead of forming their opinions from sound bites on hillary funded corporate media stop being racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in blt not calling all trump supporters as racist btfo fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they not crying though their president got elected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cnn and msnbc are the ones who wanted to divide us at all cost if there was a button you could push to end racism hillary would tackle you like a linebacker to keep you from doing so because the clinton faction of the dnc uses racial division as an avenue to power this is the moment on national television that was the opening shot of race baiting and the prohillary corporate media manipulating voters with propaganda and character assassination notice how msnbc accidentally interviews a black man ata trump rally and immedietly cuts the feed and proceeds to spread hate why would nbc do this this is why now a price tag has been hung on that scandal with politicos reporting that clinton has been paid a salary of that last part thats particularly headscratching for as a news correspondent for nbc clinton hasnt done anything to be proud of quite the contrary the disclosure raises the obvious question of nbcs goal in giving a person without any measurable journalistic or broadcasting experience or any particular public following a highprofile job and apparently paying her a topechelon salary the answer is equally obvious plainly it was done to curry favor with the clinton family the people that bought into that propaganda are now rioting and assaulting innocent people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obviously based on the definition of stupid you are thanks for admitting it youre also the racist one i know youve got huge amounts of cognitive dissonance in your brain and its time for you to accept truth youll feel a lot better i promise
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if liberals knew what words were coming out of their mouth it would be no surprise as to why they lost to djt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought the same thing when hillary said she respected the second amendment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,both extreme sides are retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are yall actually fucking defending the argument to lower the voting age year olds are retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes racially discriminated against mexicans only because mexicans racially discriminated against americans first
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,build a wall is only scary to illegal immigrants so if you arent one then no worries muslims have a tenancy to blow up and kill people ignoring this will not make it go away if you are a muslim not planning on blowing up or killing people then no worries stop and frisk also should only concern people if said frisking finds something illegal nothing illegalno worries drive through please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the thing i cant argue any of those without being labeled a racist even if my arguments are sound so i wont i hold by the idea that all racism is bad no matter the history or the current environment racism towards white people and sexism toward men is just going to strengthen the resolve of people racist towards black people and people sexist toward women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet we praise a year old for voting for hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump received much less white votes than romney or mccain he received much higher poc woman and those who voted for obama hillary would have lost against obama romney and mccain she got such a small percentage of the electorate she would have lost against most presidential candidates in history over of those who voted for her said they did because she wasnt trump over who voted for trump dont like most of his policies he was the most unpopular presidential candidate in us politics especially among white vote but you know its the racist whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a guy once threatened to punch me in the face because im white been the butt of a few slurs too this being said im not in america im from rural australia so the situations might be a little different obviously this sort of shit doesnt happen nearly as often to whites as it does to minorities and it pales in comparison to some of the treatment they get but its unfair to argue that just because it happens less that it somehow isnt racism its still discrimination based on skin colour same deal with sexism however the people who ignore the plight of minorities and only worry about white people are completely nuts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah arent white people fucking stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a good example of why year olds shouldnt vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when youre a baby during wwi and then live through the great depression wwii the korean war the vietnam war years of tension with russia desert stormshield and numerous other conflicts the civil rights movement countless other historical events and some fuckhead kid on twitter demeans you and says a year old has more of a right to vote foh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems like theres a lot of black people rioting and causing violence over this i wouldnt necessarily say that are sitting back and laughing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,same rhetoric used by you libtards with brexit will you ever get it right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in before lock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white guy got beat up for his voting choice black trump supporters got beat up at trump rallies by trump supporters cause they thought theres no way this blacks for trump bullshit is

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah argue that blacklivesmatter to twitter because thats going to solve anything when you look at the data it seems to me that the people who need to be taught that says here that of black males killed in criminal homicides from were killed by another black male
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white people im years old and i would never say she was about to blow my dick with my mother in earshot much less when i was actually talking to her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it is like the kkk and it is a racist hate group just because you yourself can be a part of it and not hate and want peace and understand that there are mostly good eggs and a couple bad ones who are going to be a part of any group be it race country religion corporation government even gangs there is probably a couple really good people who are in violent gangs just victims of circumstance but just because you are not a racist hater does not mean the core group is not it is like feminism yea there is a lot of people who join thinking oh hey i have women i love in my life that i dont want to see raped i am going to join this cool cause that is about equality and love then the higher you get the more fucked up you see their vision become in the uk a man spent a year in legal battles trying to prove his innocence in a rape that involved penetration her words video surveillance of the crime is what looks to be something like a very crowded air port guy has hand on his bag strap other hand on a newspaper camera footage shows him walk past the victim without losing stride there is no reactions of any near by of people or even a reaction or scream from the girl after a full year long battle in court he is finally innocent thing is if the girl had so much as asked him for the time and he politely answered he very might well be in prison right now that along with the massive increase in rape claims because women can be paid money if they have been raped if you can prove you live with a man and put a restraining order on him without really needing much of a proven reason you can live in his place he can not come near it or go to jail and if he refuses topay the bills this is considered assault on a woman this is only the first step of the feminist dream most of the hardcore anti feminists are not only women themselves but were part of the cause for too long until they learned the truth blm is no different if you care to talk about various ideas and thoughts behind the general movement or just what is going on in the country in general pm me and we can have a chat but i wont hold my breathe there is a crisis in this country known as antifreedom of speech where anything that is not a part of the most popular narrative witch is blm and feminism both at the absolute tops of the charts right now you will be ignored silenced banned from any types of forums or fired from your job or kicked out of school for the very slightest thing you can say that even somewhat kind of goes against any of the primary political affiliations blm and feminism hey maybe you are just a real guy who is concerned about your community cool maybe you are a racist hating jerk and anyone who ever says even the slightest thing that makes you not feel like you are right in everything you do and immune to any kind of mistakes or misunderstandings fine in this country maybe of people believe in free speech and debates

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not simply white people we all like to forget that mlk was a womanizer and had a drinking problem we all want to perceive our idols as being perfect and they just cant be we all have flaws and our views can change

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racism is going away because its not in our fking nature there was no racebased inferiority with the romans for example sure if you were darkskinned you were different but they didnt believe you were inherently bad or even not a human if you were a darkskinned roman theyd respect you as any other roman racism as it exists today was made up to justify slavery because once a slave turned christian how can you justify enslaving him so they made up thats its not the same since hes inferior and god now its genes made him that way and the reason that racism exists is because it brought profit we need to get the fuck out of this economical system and start looking towards societies where we dont focus on profit but on human fucking rights because we can yap all we want slavery has just been relocated and rebranded in sweatshops and the racism that exists today is just to keep the rich white elite as a poor white guy saying this in power

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we all just tryna ketchup
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ohh yea great so hillary can get in and wreck the place i can tell you guys really thought this one through
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you seem to have one of those first name last name usernames that are clearly hillary shills youd have to be mad to think hillary cared more about black people than trump hes not a politician hes in the entertainment biz think about that for one second he has clearly stated on several ocassions that black people will benefit most from his new policies revolving business and immigration
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think hillary would be worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats an easy one shes pro tpp i know she recently said shes not but she is and she will sign it she will let in refugees who dont care about our country she will provide amnesty to illegals she wont try to fix nafta and not last or least the corruption with the clinton fondation is through the roof im not saying donald is sparkly clean but at least he loves america it was days before they even had american flags at the dnc if you think im wrong and hillary gets in just watch how fast she will work to hurt america shes more for everyone else than americans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i disagree he employees more americans than you and hillary combined and he will he will bring our jobs back or at least try to meanwhile hillary says things like were going to put the coal industry out of business great more people unemployed exactly what we need i would have replied sooner but reddit isnt letting me for some reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought trump did great reaching out to the african american community especially recently in mi and hes right what do they have to lose at unemployment also trump played by the current rules on trade after trade deals are fixed and it makes fiscal sense to bring the jobs back he will or pay the tariff
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ill admit he has said he will only go after criminals that are here illegally he just had a huge immigration speech where he clarified that exact point i am also confident the wall will work and be paid for by mexico also trump will enforce the laws that are on the books which is something that isnt happening now

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my bad i forgot that on this sub literally everything is about race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah totally racist amirite reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is so fucking blind lmao stick to memes not politics its seriously like watching a bunch of high schoolers fresh out of their first civics class talk politics its honestly a little sad you vote

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how does someone from eastern europe have a supirority complex there are more poles than english people where i live and i can assure you their culture is not a nice one they drink and stay out late and cause havoc in the streets at midnight
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a meme sub i expected memes but half of the posts are trying to make some kind of political statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if she is asian shes probably noodling a raw dog
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most of this sub is actually pretty funny it doesnt really matter who the sub is making fun of as long as its funny but there are many posts that are essentially political statements disguised as memes that are only funny if you already align yourself with that perspective in the first place i wouldnt even mind this if the political statements were balanced this sub has jokes about white people and black people but the political jokes are from the same school of though unless youre a pretty farleft blm supporter you wouldnt really find them funny or anything but a political statement directed at you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes asain apparently black people on twitter get worse eyesight by the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,would be so racist if it said black people get worse by the day with some black guy eating chicken out a toilet bowl but you white guys pretending to be black are going to downvote me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i bet that youre white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he probably didnt recognize his white privilege adequately thus he was a devil
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,👴🏻🐒👹
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i swear black people get worse by the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think the best course of action would be to not equate everything to race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama kills women and children by the thousand cool guy trump talks like a regular guy omfg satannnn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he wasnt black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice racist memes yall would love to see what would happen if you put any other race in there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,statistically african americans iq will be significantly lower than other races even when social and economical variables are taken into account
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh i forgot statistics are the racist creation of the white man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ignored the obama part conveniently didnt you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ignored the obama part conveniently didnt you

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what the fuck this subreddit is actually ridiculous do you guys actually think the vast majority of our presidents were devils is this a joke is it because yall are black or pretending to be that you wont consider anybody before lincoln to be anything besides a fucking devil washington for fucks sake is not on any of these lists and yall are forgetting about eisenhower too shit the vast majority of presidents had the best interests of the country in mind
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dem white devils
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well im here early and i dont wanna be the annoying guy that says this will get locked but ya this will blow up and other reddit will reddit on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its literally a measure of intelligence im sorry you cant understand a simple concept like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good job generalizing some of american histories greatest men into simply their skin color that is real racism focus on the persons defining qualities and skin color isnt one of them if you say otherwise youre a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good job generalizing some of american histories greatest men into simply their skin color that is real racism focus on the persons defining qualities and skin color isnt one of them if you say otherwise youre a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but this is bpt obama couldnt have done anything wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,where did those numbers come from i missed them in that link
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably cause if you said i swear black people get worse by the day this whole sub would freak out
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah you can go fuck yourself if you think saving seventy families from the horror of american slavery is a trivial accomplishment plus in regards to her being crazy thats more than likely the result of the grievous head injury she sustained when she got hit in her in the goddamn head with a metal weight that fractured her skull while protecting a runaway slave she was an unequivocal badass freeing slaves even though she had goddamn narcolepsy you honestly dont really deserve to shit on the moses of her people and pretend its anything but childish bigoted kneejerk fear that black people and especially black women might get to enjoy feeling some pride for honestly one of the greatest americans to have ever lived jackson was a genocidal maniac the lack of respect shown by comparing the two as nearequals should make you ashamed of yourself the way it makes me ashamed to be white you give us a bad name harriet tubman is a founding mother of black freedom and deserves your respect and the respect of this whole nation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no redman method man besides them i would have to go with ghost and chef
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,delete this nephew
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,donald trump has done more for black people than obama and its not even close but you know keep being ignorant dumb fucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no jamal you be trippin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey so not trying to be hateful but i dont understand why this can be upvoted with a caption like that but black people get worse everyday would cause outrage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,read their official demands on their website and youll see theyre basically a socialist movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not every last one also you kinda just helped me prove my point that whoever made this is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah mate narrative s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,imagine how many devil emojis you would need to show black lives matter membership
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doesnt matter everyone that this sub decides they dont like is automatically white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahaha white people hahaha great sub guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im pretty sure the ratio of negative mannered jokes about white people as a whole to black people as a whole is high
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if you want a line of black presidents go live in africa theres plenty of countries to choose from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about the ones who get on subway blastin dey music and rubbing creams on dey hands or them eatin wings on the subway trowin da bones on da floe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah you said it all white males are satan so deep
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,open racism cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you like getting this shit locked because this is how you get this shit locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,inauguration dumb bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,according to the same exact poll that this guy is citing only of black americans think the emancipation proclamation was a good idea do you think maybe the poll itself was inaccurate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what percentage of black people are like black people twitter it is why i dont like black people this sort of culture i wouldnt like you if you were white or asian etc and behavedspoke or had vales like that dont ban me for being racist please this is a real question do most black people like this sort of thinking or are they embarrassed by it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking downvoted dumb fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shut the fuck up bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks for responding i want to know what percentage of black people are into the whole hood culture way of living thats what i dont like about black culture to me white guy who has been mugged by black people and took my money back from them in penn station nyc i think the black people eg ben carson senator cain are fine but the hiphop gangsta etc people are crap its not about their race its because white black brown etc i simply do not like people who are not more into society than their own paramount no contribution really survival under any circumstances i mean do you think that there are no evilcrappy black people having kids just for the government benefits professional victims anything that happens to them is the white mans fault etc most white people in the us did not own slaves many of them lives just like slaves slavery is still happening in africa today many white people didnt immigrate to the us until after the civil war irish potato famine the bible says slavery is okay if you indebt yourself to much what say you on these issues please address each one if you please peace only comes from understanding predators and parasites are evil as are their enablernurturers if you support evil you are evil in the bible yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,confirmed is black peoples twitter cant even spell youre
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont think its rare to find white racism you just have to know where to look it pales hehe in comparison to institutional racism that minorities have to face but while living inner city i couldnt go a day without hearing how much someone hated white people all baseless of course
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,eat my dick bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy shit this man deserves a harem of females for that block
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its actually a bit different you may be the most attractive and successful man in the world but if she doesnt see you in a sexual way it doesnt matter it would be like asking why she doesnt fuck her brother just because her brother is hot girls are weird like that they need to feel that sexual man to woman dynamic with you most guys mess this up because they become platonicfriends with the girl first and then develop feelings or sack up and admit to the feelings they always had too late the boat has sailed youre her hot brother guys are different we dont really need to feel that emotional man to woman dynamic if a girl is sufficiently good looking we are always down to fuck doesnt matter if we just met or have been friends for years if our dick gets hard we are down just the way were programmed on the flipside if a guy friendzones a girl its generally because we just dont think shes attractive i tend to think guys have it a bit worse in this regard girls can drastically and easily improve their attraction by working out and dressing nicely guys have to try and change the fundamental ways in which they view and interact with women and of course be goodlooking as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,miss me with that guy shit nigga

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh ho ho how the turns have tabled
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except he is a realist in fact he knew from the start he wouldnt be the nominee and had no plan to win the nomination he succeeded in pushing hillary further left on a number of issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im guessing through murder and cheating but ay what do i know im probably about to kill myself by shooting myself times n the back and jumping off a roof
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre both terrible trumps an idiot and hillary called black teens super predators they both suck ass my dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no just vote for trump you illiterate sexist fuck boy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these would be funnier if he spoke balckish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know this sub is full of white people when everyone is quoting evanescence and papa roach

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im from sweden and i think im pretty good at english but i am not able to understand any of this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao google terry vs ohio stop and frisk is constitutionally protected under the amendment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,terry v ohio us was a decision by the united states supreme court which held that the fourth amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures is not violated when a police officer stops a suspect on the street and frisks him or her without probable cause to arrest if the police officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed is committing or is about to commit a crime and has a reasonable belief that the person may be armed and presently dangerous

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nothing is wrong with being gay the problem is when you arent but you do homosexual things its disrespect like changing the way you act or speak which happens to be a lot of mfs on this sub that dont come from the background they are caricaturing whether that be black people gay people or anyone else they arent do you feel me bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,id just move those loyalty points over to pussy tbh with ya id rather get a good meal and good kitty shit im barely even loyal to myself in a lot of ways if were being real here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,motherfucker i worked on bills campaign for governor of arkansas i am very fucking familiar with hillary fucking clinton i know exactly what racistass coddled ivy league white girls pretend to be like on the outside and what they are really like on the inside
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bill was happy though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it simply is not true i know butterflies more important than deaths which are based on the number of high school i have peace monkeys trained to fight and im not a military sniper you anything but it was not we wanted to determine the sex i mean i see the face of the earth if you think you can find something on the internet evo cars be prepared for hidden spy network in the united states to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights i must say better the storm destroyed painful memories half of the children died you can do it anywhere and i can already killed hundreds of hands this is wrong but smaller oil reserves like an old man that some phones navy to play ugly but now we can not pay ridiculous prices i do not want to disrupt their wounds half of the children died
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why is it white boys but black guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shed get bodied like on narcos season
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,condoning the murder of the republican candidate why am i actually surprised by bpt i really shouldnt be
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not voting left just voting for a candidate that wants to let refugees and others come to the country to leech off social programs like welfare and food stamps
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rtumblrinaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i really dont care rapists should be fucking hanged or castrated for their crimes or sentenced to life in prison so they can never hurt anyone again stealing is not as bad as raping someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what hahappen was
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are a fucking idiot stop talking to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary woulda killed the baby then when they asked her bout it said she couldnt remember it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,crazy af tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and hillary has a picture floating around kissing robert fucking byrd on the cheek you know robert i spent years recruiting for the klan byrd she idolizes margaret sanger the same margaret sanger who actively tried to do away with the entire black race shes a proud goldwater girl as well fucking goldwater gtfo thinking just because someone sits on a podium and says they arent racist on tv doesnt mean they aint behind a desk groaning about niggers when the doors close
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,democrats havent done shit for the african american community but keep voting for them 👏🏿 you finally have someone who cares and wants a better life for all americans and you shit all over him he racist tho lol

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,username checks out now i have whiplash from that sudden violent turn in subject matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does talm mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ion had me rereadin that shit for a minute
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,read my post history and tell me im a trump supporter i know you liberal fucks arent too keen on research that wont result in something sexy or scandalous but go ahead and try anyway i just noticed there is a particular amount of hate here for trump but even when some redditors are calling hillary out as well the majority flock to the latest huffpost article like its holy or claim to be voting for the lesser of two evils especially the bernie crowd its disgusting to watch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you really think someone would just do that go in a text message and tell lies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do you block subreddits from showing up on my reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes white though 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,anyone know what ion means i kinda dont think hes talking about an atom with a different amount of neutrons than protons tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats the problem with two adults who happen to be busty blondes making love to their brother
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rimgoingtohellforthis
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats what my people want you to do fuck that i dont even question that you guys deserve as many rights as we have
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not a real conversation
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall make assumptions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she worded it like a dumbass though thats on her and she will take the l for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black drives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so does donald trump aka the worst person ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and have them arrest donald trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its still a stupid question in my opinion for example if there was a butcher hanging out in the middle of the night covered in blood and a meat cleaver just hanging out scaring people would anyone askcare if its a real butcher no because its not an environment for a butcher to be in uniform in likewise these arent environments where you should see a clown in full makeupcostume regardless if its their profession or not which is the very reason its creepy in the first place context is key here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt have left a note then again i wouldnt have risked my car to prove a point either fuck this dumb bitch any surprise its a woman who parked like that though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when you are black and dont study
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jaxon kale captain sailor star starla and katiebrooklyn ive literally never met a single person with one of those names jamaldin

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha looks just like blacklivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive seen that nigga in some trump campaign vids where the fuck are his parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the hypocrites tried to oppress him even showing up at his work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those rules apply across all subs and predate meirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rmeirl is that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its kind of sad most posts like these are obvious trolls but you seem the genuinely not be able to make the connection that this entire sub is a mockery of pseudo black culture without having to put blackculture on every post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whichever one wont try to exercise whiney feminism when were in a relationship
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because internet death threats are meaningless
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if by wrecked a blm guy you mean took advantage of a dude with an obvious learning disability than yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop n frisk is in fact national already since and has not been banned in new york city it is also known as a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiterrystop named after the court case terry v ohio in which the practice of police briefly detaining a person on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity was found to be constitutional the issue lies in police work quotas and proper oversight rather than the practice itself regardless of who you vote for terry stops are not likely to be abolished nor are the related traffic stop
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,austinsavillgmailcom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white latinas are great but i prefer white girls atm honestly i love me a girl with an ass and thats playful but latin girls always are a bit crazy or high maintenance white girls can be too but ive noticed theyre more often about their own life and got shit handled a latin girl needs you to be papi while a white girl will be out there making here own money the flip side though you gotta treat white girls with more respect and be on your game too and the sex is hot or miss they either are a starfishmissionary or they want that candle wax and choke them the fuck out shit tldr find yourself an educated white latin chick no nurses
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of the act in which a person tries to pick up person usually with intentions of getting to know them person will respond to them by telling person that they are in a relationship making it very clear to person that they are not interested dude did you see how jessica was curbing that guy httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lil cinnamon dirtytan is particularly disgusting shes the one who exposed where the poor kid works this is the danger of letting the mainstream media dictate how you feel about certain events every argument put forth against this young man has been bought and paid for by people that just loooooove watching black people tear each other apart
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i doubt it blm is pretty firmly founded in confirmation bias and a denial of reality the police arent only killing black people thats just all you hear about because the media reports what sells and racist cops is a better sorry than misunderstanding they happens to white people too or even cops given too much leeway
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pathetic all black people have to think the same way right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you wild haha wyd tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate him because he points guns at innocent people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats why you rather are a spoiled rich white kid whose parents buy his graduation

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall joking right or am i dead ass the only one who wouldnt smash yea she thick but her legs bein that ripped is weird af to me tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i know this sub has so many idiots its sad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they also came out and said it was staged
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tldr you disagree with her therefore you assume shes a bad person typical sjw logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuckboy did you seriously just assume my gender thats fuckgirl to you shitlord
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,holy shit you got me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rip narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the fuck i swear about to be the most paused year in history

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,moms spaghetti

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dad and stepmom got divorced my dad has his own problems with monogamy which is the direct reason why i had a stepmother in the first place in his younger days my dad was a drummer in a rock band that was on the road a lot and never grew out of that lifestyle hes currently in a long term relationship with another women and hes told me hes thinking of getting married againi honestly dont know wtf hes thinking youd think going through multiple divorces where he loses a fuck load of money would be a deterrent to getting hitched again but not for my dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course its a fucking monkey smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thanks man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because grouping up all white people as evil enemies of social justice is the new acceptable thing to do for example this mtv white guys resolution video they released but later took down from their twitter after some backlash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacks commit a vastly disproportionate amount of crime compared to whites gonna trigger on me too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the person i replied to made it sound like white people dont get shit by cops which is absurd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you wont get anywhere with that statement on this sub so much racism in these comments insinuating all cops are racist and whenever they get pulled over its because theyre black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shhhh they hate white people here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i came for the funny tweets not for the antiwhite antipolice rhetoric racism doesnt bother you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its implied theyre talking about white cops replace racism with prejudice and bigotry if you want to include all cops in their assertions of cops being racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats the problem people shrug off racism and prejudice towards whites but anything against minorities makes headlines
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga its like bitches who get sloppy drunk like sailors and suck dick like seamen too thats bout per chick handles of cheap vodka and a big pack o crystal light packs o ciggs amd there u are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no you idiot simply replace the words white with black in your original comment you dumb shit its not that complicated you fucking baboon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow spoilers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we some educated niggas outchea
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude needs his im not a racist card stamped by a poc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cakes to the left
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bruh black people are literally the first people on earth and invented everything dont let anyone tell you otherwise
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do you hate black women cuz im not tryna put up with the same shit dad and uncle terry put up with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aint got no shame about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why isnt there any police in our community police police their community why are we be targeted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,makes whitey feel bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but then i thought back back to a better me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mlk ended racism some white people probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary attracting flies to her because shes trash booom
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she doesnt even look pregnant just fat as fuck its always lower income people who make pregnant belly pics of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there are muslim only places in egypt they ban south asian and filipinos from malls in qatar this is what i have seen it must be far more common globally than we think
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did trump really sit his rape victims next to the him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i came fast like in white neighbourhoods
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uhhh its from j cole forest hills drive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,j cole no role modelz learn ya hip hop references if youre gonna browse here son
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably like me and hates both of them lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get why you are complaining its not like you can defend yourself with a gun or anything so just sit there and take it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this one is set in the actually
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,um isnt that literally what happens in this game i wouldnt think the italians would let a moolie in their gangs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump clinton of the undecided
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe follow the fucking plot line
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and then those assholes in congress whine when us brothas need to protect ourselves with guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats the look you give when women you sexually abused are sitting right across from you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is why feminists hate on white men but give muslim theocracies a pass its just waaaay safer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thought so ive been here for years and ive never seen or heard of a place like that to be fair though mecca in saudi arabia is a muslimonly city which struck me as odd when i learned about it as for example the vatican isnt christian only
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe theyre afraid that if they have to enforce the law theyll be called racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fukn cuck feminists have infected the blacks now sad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do the rich neighborhoods need to be called white im being serious here we all have the same opportunity in america in fact black people have it easier their inner city schools dont even provide an adequate teacher half the time just show up dont punch any of your teachers in a nigga moment and youll essentially obtain a scholarship for nothing also affirmative action will guarantee you get into a good school over hard working white people and asians so in all black people of america you can fuck yourselves with your complaining
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably because the rich white neighborhoods pay more in taxes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a woman went on cnn and said bill raped her and that hillary threatened her to shut it and lie in court or she will die other women came forward too with the same exact story
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well they do need more weapons and armor before going into a poor black area
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this comment section being brigaded by the fucktard deplorables it seems
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,does that mean trumps right we need more police in poor and black neighborhoods
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wait i thought we hate cops and dont want them around
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i aint voting for either candidate but both clintons took an l tonite
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpiimgurcompyshgjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well it makes sense since the rich pay more taxes than the poor heck in most cases the poor dont even pay taxes at all and only live from wellfare cant both eat the cake and keep it it tact
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that guy sure looks stumped
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man trump should stop beating around the bush
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i had a trashy friend that complained about the customer service she received from her cellular carrier after she had paid her bill this is the same thing the poorer neighborhoods arent paying taxes and are committing the bulk of the crimes in the first place shame this series had to commit suicide like this most people see right through this bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oc from yours truly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha he raped several women and his wife threatened to kill their children if they testified haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do you do fellow african americans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha he raped several women and his wife threatened to kill their children if they testified haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the question is would you play as the discriminator or discriminated
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh no hes tetarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol good goys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if black people think hillary has their interests at heart theyre as dumb as a rock
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub has turned into rhillary and rpolitics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as a canadian watching the debate and not taking side i must admit i think trump won the debate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary let me tell you how he isnt going to fix it no hillary the question was how are you going to fix it hillary dodging questions like ali dodges punches
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,super predators
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mglln posting antitrump content what a refreshing change
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,moderator how are you going to fix it clinton ill fix it moderator how clinton deletes question
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,at least black people wont be as shocked when they find out hillary gives as little of a fuck about them as obama does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,chance youre white dont worry the tape of trump saying the n word will be released soon enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so like hillarys entire political platform
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga honkey please take that ctr crap to rpolitics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall acting like hillary didnt do this too smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry we all dont get naked and put our ass in the air and sell our pride and self respect to the highest bidder you are bought and paid for just like hillary you are the problem with the us a vote for hillary is a vote for a mindless robot just like this loser
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the old rule forbid posts promotingdecrying specific politicians or political candidates but umglln really dislikes trump so he changed the rules
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i did though didnt i
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,praying does nothing stop harassing me and fuck off dude youre life is so pathetic im going back to work you finish sitting in your basement shilling for hitlery clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i cant recall what difference does it make
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yea but that was only her public policy so why even listen to her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,clinton does the same shit lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she conveniently droned over the wall street speeches i wanted to hear how she made million dollars personally since she started as secretary of state
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,with a little research you can look at his post history its nothing but praise for hillary and bashing trump its very easy to notice that he is a paid shill its also very easy to research correct the record and see that they pay people to do this exact thing on reddit use some fucking common sense and put two and two together if youre not smart enough to do that i can see why you support hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,everyone downvote this guy he is criticizing hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey umglln who ya voting for in the election i really cant figure it out with your post history
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,moderator madam secretary it has been debated on whether you deleted those emails or not hillary no uh thats a lie moderator but didnt you say it was an accident hillary oh yeah it was an accident anyways donald what is your plan to fight isis youre sexist misogynist homophobic and racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mglln changed rule about there being no political posts so he can push his liberal agenda in a sub thats supposed to be about humor
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when its from a mod
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah a glimpse into a distorted alternate reality where some different debate happened nifty
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not as bad as the hill telling people to fact check her on her own website
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats a given everyone knows hillary is completely incapable without bill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,gets those famous people checks from the famous people company inc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,want to elaborate on the speeches transcripts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that was bill look at the women he raped get it right fucking tards
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like that the mods here removed the post that made the clintons look bad but left this one up that makes trump look bad good job mods lets keep reddit a safe space from these horrible trumpkins

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary that was a lie
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stay lit fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,got one right here for you buddy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i do honestly think he gave sufficient answers this debate or at least i did understand what he was planning to do on most topics like healthcare
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the goldman sachs ones and why is she so heavily funded by a foreign government millions of dollars from saudi arabia why
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like black people twitter would actually understand anything trump says if he actually understood it stop pretending like of the people here dont work at taco bell and got percentiles on their standardized test scores
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if she made giving speeches she needed to give speeches ignoring interest on investments that would be one speech per day since she left the secretary of state office do you just not believe that corruption exists
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i worry about this sub but not because im black these political posts are starting to get annoying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,even more worrying
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im asking because im curious to see what you think corruption is maybe you can give some examples of corruption in our government
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,triggered reeeeeeeeee

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yep and all i see is ugly this on the other hand is beautiful and doesnt even need to do half the work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,genetics also only make up for around about of the variance in a broad range of cognitive abilities the rest being the result of environmental factors how about that there is a reason why america and europe and not africa are world leaders
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah thought it might be a crossdresser or a monkey trying to be human or something ugly as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck i hate shit like this its not funny just because you try extremely hard to be funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,find me non jewish sources thats all i ask
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,half joking half honest i literally cannot see beauty in black women maybe its because i never grew up with them around me maybe its because they try far too much and end up looking like clowns i dont know just cannot see it their extreme im an independent woman and i dont need any man overly masculine attitude is also a complete turn off
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmfao the slaves themselves also were not free of being douches please

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well doing drugs is pretty ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so youre saying white people can be ghetto too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ghettoness isnt based on race dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most college kids are degenerate drug users honestly have you never heard of a college having a reputation for parties
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont know about you but all i can say is that for me its definitely based on attitude action and clothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not saying they dont have the right to act how they like but that doesnt protect them from criticism or judgement from people who arent ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was fleekalicious in the squad fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,than moses saved them only to have it happen again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,superpredators ftfy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe because you guys are the biggest hypocrites on the internet

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rfatlogic

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,typical a welfare queen sticking up for obongo because of nothing other than race keep banging those drums subhumans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and all black bitches have illegitimate niglets before they turn whats your point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,malia can you do us a favor and smoke a joint so we can focus on you instead of hillarys crimes std ridden health and evil backroom deals t cnn msnbc et al

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rthathappened
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how does this have a libs cant handle the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its definitely not all black women much love to the natural educated sexy truly independent black women out there but cmon guys lets not act like there isnt an epidemic in our community of people who wish to make absolutely nothing of themselves men and women alike ratchet is the term we use to describe these creatures but more and more i see black people who never grew up around any of that nonsense dumb themselves down to meet the expectations that the media has set for our culture without a doubt he should have worded his statement better but i think we all know exactly what hes talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im talking about it like a person educated in politics would i wish everyone would do research and be more active politically regardless of their ideology shame people are more interested in kim kardashian than the trillion we have accumulated in debt or the selling of arms to terrorist groups or hundreds of millions the war on marijuana alone is costing us etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do most white folk not support blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if he was a middle aged white woman in pantsuit he wouldnt serve any time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpadultimgsitebvhgifv
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was a good boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more than half of this cookie cutter trumper rhetoric false such as
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,pig god is the hero we need
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,more like were used to politicians pandering to black america with shady cultural references ie colored people time like shit bpt is a real thing but its never said like how you said it and youre not near tight enough with all of us to be making that joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit boy honestly i was confused at first didnt even notice i was like wtf errybody trippin bout
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im a republican til i hate black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah its pretty lame when your ice cream makers openly support domestic terrorism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just because the republican candidate is a racist asshole doesnt mean we all are
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the most racist thread i have ever seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the black lives matter movement is foolish its activists and goons in search of a reason to act like shitheads there is no problem in america that black people face that isnt also a problem at varying degrees for every other race you arent going to solve police brutality just for black people you wont end poverty just for black people but weve done a hell of a job drawing lines between ourselves with this joke of a movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people support beings similar to themselves human nature right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they also commit more crime than white people so there is a reason they are shot at more
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,every stereotype exists for a reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you saying people that steal shouldnt be killed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,absofuckinglutely i am a thief is a thief a criminal has no rights the only rights that exist is the right to property and the safety of it its by far the most important thing aside from individualism read rand

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jesus we have really turned into a bunch of disgusting fat asses in america ive been traveling around asia since march and havent seen one single nonwesterner who is this size bring on the downvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,see im one of those people with a preference and even i think this is some bs black women make poor decisions is a ridiculous thing to say and pretty racist you cant judge someones decision making skills by their melanin content thats just stupid i dont mess with black chicks or other dark skinned women because dark skin doesnt turn me on its a purely physical thing for me i cant control what gets my motor running any more than a gay guy can start liking pussy this guy actually views black women as inferior to white women which is racist as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that is obscene
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this thread kinda proves most of the users here are white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one time during class this fat bitch that my group of friends didnt like wore a purple shirt my friend called her grimace and it was the funniest shit ive ever heard the class was small with only a few people and i could not contain myself i apologized to the teacher multiple times and then excused my self outside where i laughed my ass off to the point of tears
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i mean i even dislike dark colored nipples and labia minora on white girls its not a race thing its just a preference i like pink parts there are a lot of absolutely beautiful black chicks out there halle berry nathalie emmanuel aaliyah but they just dont do it for me once the clothes come off some dudes dont date redheads i dont think thats messed up

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh yes black lives matter the truly most peaceful protest there is protest against chanting black power while raiding stores and setting whites on fire in the name of progressive change bring out the downvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair you can change your weight not your height short ugos are fucked tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does everyone always make the joke with the age of consent is usually around in most states and the worldwide is probably even lower smh nigga you go hit dat year old
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so you identify as a toaster
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah yes blame everybody else and never yourself for your shortcomings this couldnt possibly be related to the fact that black people despite being only of the us population make up to of the inprisoned felons or just generally that black people are statistically more likely to commit violent crime no it couldnt possibly be that it must be da whitey be racist they holdin us down and shieeeeeeeeet
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,psa to blacks whites are not as scared of you as you may think psa many whites carry guns psa people will kill your ass regardless of what their skin color is or background psa try to beat up a white person for wearing blackface on halloween may get you killed better keep your cool understand they are not the brightest and try to have a good time

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,while yall worried about these guys black kids be looking like
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im still pretty sure this sub is like percent white people who only talk black when posting here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fair but declaring something as anti black doesnt necessarily make it so just because you are black obviously anyone can say anything with such an epidemic of sjws firing off about how every little thing is racist or microaggressive its difficult to take claims seriously if people were pointing out legitimate problems and providing practical ideas for solutions everyone would be happy except not everyone in fact the exact kind of person that sees something and thinks thats anti black is the kind of person that will never be satisfied because theyre always looking for something to call offensive plus as anyone who actually understands a bit of the political landscape of the last years will tell you voting democrat is the stupidest thing the black community could do but always does as a whole mass incarcerations of black fathers mommy government money etc and now with the culture of racebaiting instead of unifying as a society and creating our own means of accomplishing our goals without the fucking government were being pitted against each other by the media which intentionally makes it seem like white people are the cause of black peoples problems which is bullshit obviously the specific people responsible are white but theyre the same psychopaths who always lead society and do terrible things because psychopaths always lead society the amount of whitehate is growing and its scary we dont need people pointing out what is anti or offensive to we need to wake up to the fact that the people are being lied to on a massive scale and if nothing is done western society is finished and the one world government will be installed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rniceguys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah just them android emojis are garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because those kids are just going to blow random shit up with fireworks the muslims are looking to blow people up with bombs

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someones triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,god i hate white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not gonna lie former trump voter here this is fucking hilarious watching trump crash and burn but in all seriousness we cant let this guy get the nuclear codes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought that racist posts werent allowed in this subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because muslims conform to a dangerous dogmatic religion which goes further than something as superficial as a bad haircut
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this phones battery is at and needs charging i am a bot i use ocr to detect battery levels sometimes i make mistakes sorry httpsnpredditcomrphonebatterylevelbot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i believe this has to be at least pointed out if this was the opposite none of you would be silent against racism but you seem to think prejudice is okay if its not racism you are judging these kids based on their skin color and haircuts their parents made for them get off your high horses learn to have some empathy if you ask for empathy in return
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody feels sorry for you whine all you want since you atent a slave yourself and never have been we dont care keep blaming society for your own problems

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this mofo has been eating every day smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh my god is that fuckin shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well not a dad though im sure a lot of people on here in bpt can relate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,liberals are so quick to demonize people they disagree with as if blacks are the upstanding educated group as they go around murdering each other by the hundreds every day

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we just lay off the political memes for a week ffs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit gets heated so fast when we inject politics in every sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes so ugly when shes pregnant
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if a group of people directly affected by racism claims something is racist and you dont think the same way you probably just dont understand because you dont know how to get in their shoes antiwhite people hate is not growing by your logic me saying that it is growing is proof enough because how could you know youre not white i am assuming youre not and i understand white people are not subjected to it on as grand a scale as black people but it is absolutely growing i had a middle eastern chick tell me on the subway that my opinion didnt matter at all because im white and she only cared about my black friends opinion we werent talking about race at at it was a conversation about selfconfidence my black friends were stunned and it took them telling me what exactly she meant because hearing it i didnt think there was any way some chick was just gonna tell me my opinion didnt matter because of my race white hate is absolutely growing its fucking mainstream now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,httpimgurcomdchkrdcjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kanye already won though since his kids are actually cute af and dont like like a year old jay z on a garden gnome

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets not pretend black people sit there reading the constitution either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cause trump didnt kill soldiers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can guarantee most people here who slam trump havent read the constitution or much less the primary sources of news articles that bash him with a hairtrigger i could be wrong though maybe cnn outlawed reading such things without their permission in that case i apologize
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly fuckin dumb ass ritzs

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what all youd do with the constitution is try to smoke it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah but saying all white people are racists because youve had bad experiences with white racists is exactly the same as when a someone has had bad experiences with black people and they say that all black people are violent and ignorant generalizations are never true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when did the left care or know anything about the actual constitution
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn i loved splash mountain as a kid and had no idea what is was based off thinking back at all the character voices now makes me cringe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ever heard of the amendment these people are outside the jurisdiction of the united states and should not be extended constitutional rights what about the us code ever read that check us c section whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate thats alright though you have a vague grasp on the constitution and think trump is violating it by making decisions for the best interest of america

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i grew up in a predominantly black town we were as poor as it got and living in the ghetto with all the other broke as fuck niggas i was literally peer pressured by black people to use that word among others i started out modest but that quickly disappeared i certainly didnt mind its a solid word and i like handy words anyway point is i grew up using nigga and every curseword and slur in the book as did everyone around me when i finally made it to middle class society and people looked at me all horrified including black people when i started saying nigga this and nigga that i laughed in the faces you gonna fight me nigga even if you win it aint no sweat of my back ive been getting my ass kicked on the street since i was a wee lad plus its just ridiculous how people not in this shit with the rest of us just dont understand how we cope we are brutal to each other fuckin roasting and fighting and calling each other every name in the book every second of every day it keeps us harder than the world were living in and provides some comic relief in a setting that doesnt really lend itself that well to humor nigga is a special word for me i fuckin destroyed myself working my ass off tryna get to college i do and then i show up with my dialect and i was just fuckin eaten alive by those goddamn sjws i still cant fuckin escape the irony i was as much a slave to the white man as anyone else back home i just got lucky and happened to have a little excess test taking skills and it was still an uphill battle all the way to freshman year hell i didnt know how any of the shit worked so i didnt register properly after the first year and couldnt return for the second i spent most of that time being homeless on the street then i come back to school again for them to start screamin about me about my white privilege and racism cause i go around sayin nigga now i never really stopped but it got to the point where i didnt want to say it any more now i always know and rejoice returning to the company of my real friends and family because no one gives a shit and no matter how brutal we are to each other we got somethin thicker than blood and we have each others backs to the last and occasionally i let some of the people from college visit me and mine and they just sit there in shocked silence while a group of white black mexican and indian motherfuckers pelting each other with the most vile slurs and insults and threats you are one of those people i would bring home cause you a little punk bitch ass nigga who will make everything funnier just by sitting there stewing in your own vicarious shame
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when me and my wealthy sheltered suburban white friends get together out of earshot of any black people every third word is nigga and theres nothing any of you can do about it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in the us yes i grew up in germany and only moved to the us in black people in western europe never faced the same discrimination my skin color first became a topic after moving over here in europe no one gave half a fuck so to be precise youd be able to go back to if you want just not in the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,white supremacists might support trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you just reduced every trump supporter down to one issue race thats another thing i would say everyone is tired of being told what we think and why simply because we are white there is more to trump than identity politics crap there is no specific time that people want to go back to but some trump supporters want to get back to the economic boom of the or the second amendment rights of the our reputation before our noninterventionism of the etc etc why is race the only thing you consider of importance when it comes to peoples views and politics can you not imagine a person who makes decisions based on anything but race this race baiting shit is insane nowadays
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah what about unlike popular belive hitler never prosecuted black people in fact there were around black soldiers serving in the wehrmacht in especially in rheinland existed a comparably huge interracial community for that time american pop culture just stylized hitler as everything racist while in fact he never gave a single fuck about black people who could freely live in germany since always and could achieve titles and land since so yeah go to germany if you want no one cares that youre black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes i would they are stupid i dont hate mexicans i just think you shouldnt be able to stroll in here and say fuck you to everyone who did it the right way no one hates immigrants everyone only wants them to do it legally why does no one understand that are we burning mexican flags in their streets i also dont hate arabs but i dont think we should let in unidentified people from the middle east with no checks whatsoever that hasnt been working out well for europe recently and now if we learn the lessons from there and say no syrian immigrants until we can properly check them its racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt generalize that only white people support trumpive seen some blacks and hispanics in there toomaybe ask them what their great america is idkim all about the bern
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,switch black people in that text with jews french us soldiers poles russians belarussians romas and its still accurate in fact on a statistical level black especially french soldiers were more often incarcerated than executed i would recommend you read other germans a book by tina m campt about the black community in germany pretty good historical book about how black people lived comparably well in a society that was founded over racial divide
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,total butterface
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how about gay niggas with swag
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get it is bad grammar a black people thing now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and yet commit of violent crimes but cops just wanna kill right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is greatness my nigg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i wouldnt mind if a couple of black people i knew got shot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they are percent of the population and commit half the homicides in the us you aint mad about that look it up facts arent hard to find
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the difference is white people dont assume other white people didnidu
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its also a construct of fathers not sticking around to raise their children
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not like black people are of a more violent nature theyre not inherently more dangerous from birth wellllllll
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i go to a mostly white school and they couldnt care less like honestly we dont give a fuck about any of that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first time ive legit laughed out loud to a comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wrong no lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i can respect that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why all the race bating posts lately i come here to laugh take it elsewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people commit over of the crime too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sigh unzips
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck you stop oppressing my opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,greenlivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mom mother fucking uuuh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,once told me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,were mad that this fact is ignored so that the cops are racist blacks are victims race baiting narrative can be pushed as a political weapon thereby increasing racial tension and violence and pulling attention and resources away from more far reaching problems how many of those white police victims have you seen in videos or read about contrast that to the parade that began with trayvon martin why is that the case
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know why white people dont riot when other whites are shot by cops because we know that cops arent some monsters hell bent on killing people they must have done something to justify the cop shooting them thats why theres no white people riots or wlm just look at here you see a black teenager refusing arrest the cop was very patient but after struggling for quite a while the teenager started attacking the cop the cop finally has enough and says hes under arrest for resisting and assaulting a cop the teenager continues resisting had the teenager just stopped and listed to the cop nothing would have happened but because he tried to fight the cop he got injured and will spend some time in jail you know why i never have a problem with the police cause i listen when a cop tells me stop i stop when a cop tells me lie down i lie down even if i think what their doing is bullshit or illegal i listen if i felt they broke the law or treated me wrong i can always go afterwards to city hall or the police station and complain but if i chose to resist or fight the officer i might get injured or killed which is why i dont argue yes there are asshole cops that abuse power but youre not gonna fix that by confronting them directly we saw what happens when you try and youre certainly not gonna fix it by rioting and burning down cities next time a cop says stop fuckin listen cause it will save your life
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all the people who this subreddit is about like they finance literally everything
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,once told me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,killings by police are way down people just love to be victims seriously our president could be doing anything to help oppressed blacks but he doesnt care about them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ure

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,made it in prelock nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so who holds the criminals accountable
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i feel extra white reading chains like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate this tweet a kid at my high school was shot by a black man but funny enough im not dumb enough to assume every black man is going to shoot me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe he wanted to know if there were a specific group of people he could narrow his search down to but nah he was probably racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck off bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cops are just doing their jobs people are stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think a better statement would be its natural that cops stop black people more because there are more ghettos full of black people than other races and thats where a lot of crime and ignorance stems from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have no idea how you were able to post a sane thought in this subreddit that race baits more than any other subreddit i have ever seen and gets away with everyone should read your comment and agree with it in this thread its sane and straight to the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sure he would
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black parenting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,okay keep being a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in jail because they killed someone or someone that looked like them did

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the ol reverse oreo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,found the dumbass i gotchu fam we see no race in here
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we stop the political circle jerk in the comments im subbed here to laugh not watch a bunch of idiots argue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes not an illegal immigrant until proven guilty in a court of law wait jk you dont believe in giving those people a day in court just deport the brownies melania is an illegal immigrant until she proves otherwise and any proof she gives will obviously be fraudulent you cant trust people like her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,little help as possible she wasnt only one writing speech
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,michelles hardworking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh no you cant be racist against whites i guess no one told you s
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems like trump is the only politician that has ever done anything wrong strange
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they all do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,politicians rip speeches off all the time theyre a bunch of examples with obama biden all of them theres like dudes that write the speeches people who are eating this controversy up is the reason trump is going up in the polls and spending almost no money hes working everyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you know how to speak english she said with as little help as possible that doesnt mean that she had no help at all it just means she had as little as possible which could be a lot of help depending on her english skills
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because irrationality and feelings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it was biden himself who plagiarized not bidens wife
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because trump is an evil racist bigot according to all of the titles of the articles i dont read
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont really ever comment i just browse the shit out of this sub but im a whore for flair so ill take some dumb shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats what happens when you have something like affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably on purpose did you see the rick roll in the speech too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no he didnt but this sub is basically a circle jerk to the tenth power trump only hates illegal immigrants people love to misrepresent his arguments for upvotes though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,she claimed to have help writing it just like every other candidate has michelle obama got those words from another speech herself and this op is especially funny considering michelle obama has really worked for nothing but being obamas wife to get where she is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who claims she wrote it herself no she said she wrote it with as little help as possible i maintain my own car with as little help as possible but i still take it to the mechanics when there are issues beyond my ken
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,future first lady wait until the election
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump didnt say anything about legal immigrants either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is a video of that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well it was probably a staff write who plagiarized something not melania but i agree many times in politics the worst part of a bad thing is the cover up it would have been much easier if they had just said that one of the speech writers who helped craft it slipped it in without anyone knowing which is what probably happened in any case
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol michelle hard workingthat is a good one next you will be saying obama was a good president who didnt fuck this country and make it an international joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah like one is legal and the other isnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and michelle plagiarized saul a on that very same speech
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black folks still killimg cops or are we done with that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama is all over youtube stealing different speeches from this dude but ok one line
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because muh privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,awww did him know he did bad and say him sorry okay den aww better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he said hard working that disqualifies michelle obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is he claiming its hard work fucking the potus
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,perfect opportunity to pull everyones criticism from hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that is the problem fuck goodwill we want our allies to respect us our military might our democracy our extravagance we want our enemies to fear us they should understand that the usa can rain down pain and devastation if they step out of line american exceptionalism is key not fucking goodwill goodwill is ass kissing other countries wanting them to be our friend we dont want or need friends we need obedience
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and that showsabsolutely nothing ill trust it when a respected journalist reports on it but not joe scarborough who is a talking head
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cant wait to vote for trump again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nope but jesus christ keep it up with the stupid shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,implying that michelle obama wrote the speech she gave years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we can just legally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shes very well educated a self made millionaire and can speak more languages that you bud do something with your own fuckin life before you start telling people they have no right to speak
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,by that definition wouldnt hillary be a bigot too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,in fairness you openly went there to troll the sub not sure what you expected
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol do a google search for borrowed speech lines barack obama and see what comes up this shit is hilarious right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets play a game who said it firstyou work hard for what you want in life nope it wasnt michelle it was nicola sturgeon how about this oneyour word is your bond and guess what it was not michelle it was melvyn douglas or how about this one you treat people with dignity and respect and again it was not michelle its the motto of caregivers association so lets not go there about plagiarism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i love how the mods are all antitrump and allow these political posts to ignore rule ftfy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama shouldve dropped out mid presidency
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,meh its not like she wrote the speech herself she was given a piece of paper people operate under varying motivations it could be as simple as a speech writer was paid off to make trump look bad the dnc has no shame and everything to loose if trump wins
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not too worried about michelle i squat strap on and pegg barack obama says lets get a hot first lady in office that doesnt whine about waking up in the white house because of muh ancestors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,source
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is a man who has claimed that obama is a kenyan muslim yea uh like hillary did funding and arming isis doesnt exactly look great does it this is a man who has called global warming a chinese hoax taking advantages of liberals to raise costs and price us out of the energy market yes communists tend to do that this is a man who is an antivaxxer just wants people to be able to space them out if they want to the vaxx thing is a meme now but it wasnt always the problem with not being a politician is that your answers arent scripted and people can catch you talking about things that dont pan out given what we know now he is not an antivaxxer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its really sad that i have no choice but to openly say that the cheeto jesus is a far better candidate than that lying bitch who wants to bring blacks to heel
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama didnt make things any better
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,look up the definition of bigoted read your own comments and then tell me who the bigot is hypocrisy is an amusing thing to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,melanias speech writers ripped off michelles who ripped off alinsky who probably ripped off somebody else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all of these liberals lose their minds over a little speech but i dont hear a word coming out of their mouths when hillary was lying back to back and being investigated over the emails its funny how quick they are to lash out and shit on someone yet their own candidate is million times worse and they dont even know it i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it wasnt she ripped off alinsky who probably ripped off somebody else none of that shit is original obamas you didnt build that was warren his just words was some governor whose name i cant remember trumps wall was hillarys its all bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,truest shit my last submission was removedpolitical but look at the subs front page lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thinking we can be friendly and talk out our issues is childish the world has never worked that way empires need armies they need fear and respect
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dude michelle plagiarized that paragraph as well just relax its politics its all fucking fake
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not white im european asian and cherokee
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh so its totally cool when he does it but when trumps wife does it suddenly it means hes not fit to be president or something way to approach things from a fair unbiased perspective idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ayo gurl what dat mouf do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i just find it ironic how someone can trash a person and his supporters for being bigoted idiots while doing so in a thoroughly bigoted and idiotic fashion thats troll level stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but they are criminals by definition they broke the law by coming here illegally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no its just relax whether its an r or a d the fact that this has consumed and enraged all the phony talking heads on the news networks is ridiculous yet predictable who gives a flying fuck if two chicks married to guys running for the white house read a speech that someone else plagiarized what did you really expect of them the outrage coming from the left on this issue is comical clearly projecting their disappointment in a clinton candidacy and bernies failure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obama did the same thing with deval patrick and nobody batted an eye but when trumps wife does it its all over social media and all the liberals are yapping about it nonstop almost like they forgot their candidate cant handle classified information and is a serious danger to our country sorry to burst your bubble but trumps wife copying a speech is the least of your worries if you think hillary should be in office
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont get it is this supposed to be funny it just look like another political bull crap why is this here tsk why yall making this sub all political and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump has always talked about the heroin not weed i dont know if he ever mentioned marijuana
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lines that were similar yeah tell him to get a new razor and shave again
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why did you tell that to usirhallandoates and not ucuminmyeye its ok if your candidate does it just relax the other party did it burn them youre taking this a little far mate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol yeah right why did he call judge curiel a mexican then judge curiel belongs to la raza a mexican ethnic organization that calls for the return to mexico of territory the us won in the mexicous war in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the hillary shills are pathetic for making this into a big deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is there a difference in believes and says somethings to get votes hillary believes that blm are super predators but has since said otherwise to gain votes trump isnt my first choice but hillary is definitely my last choice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im going to need you to more clearly define hard working
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre trying way too hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stupid shit like voting for donald trump man come on and chill out did donald trump rape you or something youre irrationally angry at the guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why is politics big on bpt now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,read the yearly dea reports apperently mexico is stepping up production of meth heroin and coke they are attempting to produce it all inside mexico
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but trump literally lead a campaign claiming that obama was not born in the united states so did hillary clinton it was even her idea originally but its weird youre bringing up moon landing hoaxes vaccineskeptics global warming and jfk assassination theories they arent related to obama trump hillary and whatever else this threads about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,michelle obama hard working lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,kill the messenger
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think im entitled to call trump supporters what they are angry idiots youre not sticking to the facts i like many normal people understand that people fundamentally disagree on a whole host of issues you boiled down trump supporters into antivaccine conspiracy nut angry people funny because trump supporters havent violently protested anyone unlike some other candidates supporters and proceeded to dismiss them all as idiots with inferior opinions that right there is the essence of bigotry
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol fucking spare me youre clearly not voting for trump thats clear and i get it so who is your candidate clinton johnson stein
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he said mean things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that depends can i keep the sex drugs and rocknroll but skip out on the stds and hate for minorities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,exactly just like the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgctsioisjg of the shouldnt be doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for christs sake the law association is different from the activist organization two brances of the same org its not a coincidence the orgs name is spanish for the race it sounds like theyre really into their mexican race which is totally fine but if thats how they selfidentify then its courteous for trump to use their chosen selfdescriptors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so now the actions of any bigoted republican comes down to trump really
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,two branches of the same org its not a coincidence the orgs name is spanish for the race it sounds like theyre really into their mexican race which is totally fine but if thats how they selfidentify then its courteous for trump to use their chosen selfdescriptors
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who said any of that the original comment was trying to insinuate that she just married donald because she didnt want to work hard clearly she already had a successful career before he came into the picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey mods isnt this sub supposed to be apolitical
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you arent allowed to write essays with as little help as possible in college you need to produce it entirely on your own generally
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,considering donald trump is on the record as being an antivaxxer a global warming conspiracy theorist and claimed that ted cruzs dad shot jfk on top of being birtherinchief i think its perfectly related to his campaign thats not true you should really check your sources it speaks a thousand words that he revoked press coverage from the washington post but gave it to infowars i agree its great trump is holding media outlets like washington post accountable for their reporting while giving smaller outlets like infowars an opportunity to break the current media monopoly access
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cant stump the trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,got a link that proves snopes wrong its up to snopes to prove itself burden of proof and all that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,having or revealing an obstinate belief in the superiority of ones own opinions and a prejudiced intolerance of the opinions of others step one generalize the opinions of every trump supporter based on three fringe remarks by donald trump step two feel entitled to dismiss the opinions of all of his supporters and call them angry idiots seems pretty clear cut to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,strong independent black woman who dont need no man
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i must have missed the part where you faced slavery must have been real tough for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i do not intend to but i do appreciate the warning nonetheless
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh ok so your comment had zero purpose
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he has a point pretty easy to interpret thesewicides comment as advocating the enslavement of whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hating on trump is just a fad these people dont really care about politics they just want to be a part of the fotm circlejerk these are the same people that rooted for bernie but we all witnessed what happened no one voted lol so all of you sit back relax and watch trump build his wall
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how isnt it please explain because thats exactly how it looks or let him explain it himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you white since cops kill twice as many white people as black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cool til makes me admire him even more since its hard to break though with so many people irrationally hating vaccineskeptics for no reason yeah of course by that logic he should give a small outlet like presstv the opportunity to break the current media monopoly access maybe never heard of them so i have no opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you think michelle obama was a hard working american before she became first lady lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i really do think this hurts trumps campaign for the time friendly reminder trump has a less than chance of winning the gop nomination dont worry im sure its just a slight miscalculation you guys have nothing to worry about
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats funny cause obama never stole speeches ill be happy to post the links for ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,incredibly well put reply it had all the makings of a good comment clever quickly written and made a great point you must be real proud of yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no pyro is right dont get your yeezy panties in a wad

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao white people tryina act hood n shit not like i know about that sorta thing or anything haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol and this guy uses a throwaway whatre you scared of
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,most second generation immigrants i know refer to themselves as from their parents country plenty of people do it after hundreds of years have passed since their ancestors immigrated i dont really think that should be a point of anger in his attack on the judge
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hell id watch barbara bush cam just because of its historic nature
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wew lad
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats where prejudiced intolerance comes into play there are hundreds of reasons as to why someone might support donald trump over hilary clinton which is also a pretty important distinction considering there are only two real options left for president and undoubtedly many of his supporters didnt initially support him i dont think anyone in the history of voting has ever voted for someone they agree with of the time they support based on issues important to them a candidates stance on fiscal social economic environmental or even security issues could sway a voter depending on what they value the most if i were an activist for green peace or whatever i might not look any further into a candidate than their environmental policies i personally lean conservative on most issues i find important namely fiscal policy it would be considered prejudiced intolerance to call me an angry idiot and dismiss my opinion because im voting for trump prejudiced because its a preconceived opinion not based in reason im not anti vaccine and i dont really care if trump is i dont care if he actually thinks global warming is a chinese hoax or obama is a muslim those are not things i would look much into when deciding on a president its unreasonable to believe that one must agree with everything ever said by a candidate and here is the kicker the same bigoted things can be said about hilary clinton supporters or anyone for that matter without fail i could generalize all of her supporters using her fringe baggage and say anyone who supports her is an idiot thats pretty much todays political landscape in a nutshell though the only reason i even jumped in on this was because i thought it was funny how hypocritical that person was being completely generalizes millions of peoples views based on three or four relatively meaningless trump tweets and then declares every one of those people idiots with inferior opinions to his own but no hes not bigoted sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,someone cite one job michelle obama has had in her life for me please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well michelle stole it from elizabeth dole from so
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so blame one republican for all republicans what are you prejudice
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol k
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youve made your disdain for him abundantly clear but that shouldnt transfer to each and every supporter of him thats where you came off bigoted im not voting for him based on vaccination obama or climate change i dont find those issues to be particularly important to me when deciding on clinton v trump im not an anti vaxer i dont think obama is a muslim and i trust what science says about climate change im just more focused on other issues that i align far more with him than hilary im not an angry idiot im a fairly well educated rational person that tends to lean conservative on issues i find most important when deciding on a president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because the judge was of mexican heritage and belonged to the mexicansupremacy group la raza its the same reason people in new york and new jersey call themselves italian its the same reason my relatives in pittsburgh call themselves irish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes because michelle works so hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah well working class is like a year upper middle class is like still way better off
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh right i forgot racism never existed until trump decided to run for president a year ago youre fucking delusional man if were talking about taking the blame for creating a political climate then barack obama has the blood of nearly a dozen police officers on his hands because he created a political climate where it is okay to execute police officers in cold blood its not a coincidence that black separatists love obama theyre inspired
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is rblackpeopletwitter really going to pull the youre bad because you stole something card i mean really
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm doesnt need the government to make them look stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah im sure she doesnt diet or exercise probably just stumbled onto worldclass modeling talent as well after all modeling is just being pretty it isnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that wasnt the point the point was that neither of them knows what its like to be a part of the working class onunder the poverty line busting their ass usually manual labor to barely make ends meat shes always been well off maybe not as well off as trump but certainly enough to always be completely comfortable in the situation she was in never really had to worry about money
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh i agree completely we should also get politicians to cite sources for all statistics and include a bibliography handout with all speeches cite your sources
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,🔥 title game
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sotomayor recused herself from judgement on illegal immigrants is she racist when you throw around the word racist like that it loses all meaning
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lemme get totally not racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that doesnt mean he knows what its like to be hood

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,serious question here is cheating considered normal in black american culture or do posts about cheating just always make the front page because they are funny is this whole sub satire what is the meaning of life did i leave the oven on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why do yall cry about this white cops killing innocent black males is not a major issue it doesnt even happen that often cops also shot an innocent white kid named dylan noble but that doesnt get attention because it doesnt fit the narrative there are obviously racist and powerhungry cops but id say the overwhelming majority of them are welladjusted and dont let the power get to their heads
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the clinton fanbase are not normal people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you stop being innocent when you point a gun at an officer so id say there are exceptions
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because cheating is hilarious am i right fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont find infidelity very amusing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow nice lying forms a great foundation for a relationship impressive
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga what the fuck is juith
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i said they treat me like a slave cah me black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,selling cds with a gun in your pocket wrestling with cops after you pointed it at someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh hey look at that more race baiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh man black culture tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i was going to leave this on another comment by it was deleted in any case i think this is worth saying because this false narrative is getting cops killed the narrative is more important than the facts apparently people were shot and killed by police in already thats a miraculous number considering we live in a nation of million with a more violent culture than other industrialized nations i was actually suprised its that low you have greater chance of slipping and dying in the bathtub than you do of being killed by a cop but lets delve in and look at the racial breakdown about of those killed in were white about were black the remainder is mostly hispanics and a very very small number are asians and indians you might still note that while more whites than blacks are shot and killed each year by police there is still some racial disparity when we look at each racial groups percentage of the population whites are now of the us and blacks are of the us and about whites are shot and killed by cops compared to about blacks so not withstanding the small overall number blacks are killed at a higher rate by police than whites is racism a reason for the disparity probably but another reason for the disparity is that black people commit more violent crimes in fact each year despite being only of the population black people are responsible for half of the murders in the us let that sink in and then youll understand white police have more contact with the black population tldr there is no epidemic of officers killing black people the entire issue is created by the shark attack phenomenon ie if we make every shark attack a national news event people will think they happen all the time when in fact shark attacks are a statistically rare thing the issue of people being killed by police is worth addressing but people a year is not a national epidemic thats good news right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,all are innocent the cops are guilty i think idk i just want to fit in with ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,come back guys i hate that capitalist pig as well but hes probably going to wreck hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,guess no one heard the last line from the biggest hypocrite of
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when did this sub go full radicallib
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blacker the berry the sweeter the jews
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,since when did black people have legible handwriting
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cock sucker mother fucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,come back from it it is such a small deal i cant believe anyone even gives a shit about this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry its hard to detect that on the internet sometimes haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because it is a hallmark of and almost exclusive to leftist ideology
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and michelle stole it from others its not like those words phrases are her creation in the bible specifically numbers the moshe tells the tribes of israel when a man swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth in the bishop of exeter wrote the honest man his word is his parchment or when michelle said the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them mark r hughes said that and red green said something close to it back in youre only limited by your own imagination and the laws in your area these are pretty common sayings and what makes it more amusing is that michelle and barack made these comments to republicans because its part of the basic republican story of personal responsibility and how opportunity abounds in america for those willing to work to reach their goals
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why does black culture value cheating so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well black people are of the population and again they commit largely disproportionate amount of the violent crime in the us resulting in a disproportionate amount of police contact and you could argue that the numbers killed by police are too high and i would agree but comparing our country to other developed countries doesnt work so well because we have a much more violent culture in the us yes we have more deaths by cop but we also have a hell of a lot more violent crime when you look at murder rates in this country as compared to other developed nations youll see why we have more police involvement also in some parts of america a comparison to a developed nation really isnt analogous some parts of this country may as well be the third world and why do you say its not a purge on black people yet theres not going to be a purge deaths by cop in year is incredibly unfortunate and it is a problem but when you consider how large this country is its a small number so yes its a problem that needs attention and needs to be dealt with on an individuallocal level but its not an epidemic that warrants the inflamed rhetoric weve been seeing lately and it certainly doesnt warrant the ambush execution of police officers
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres nothing to chill about he was very relaxed composed in his comment plus he is absolutely correct this is really a weak stance to take up to try to libel anyone but it doesnt matter because the memes are flowing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i thought he already came back from it with that tweet the media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of melanias speech than the fbi spent on hillarys emails
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am a donald supporter so its interesting to hear takes on my candidate from another person im not arguing with you this is what you believe however even though i think donald is partially doing this for himself and his family name i also think he genuinely wants to help our country without the united states being what it is there would be no trump name this whole scandal is being used to stir up drama during the post primary and pre presidential debate lull in spicy stories
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im pretty sure i was past high school before you were born the point i am making is that its not like they are some phrases that michelle coined however you are right that it was lifted almost verbatim
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre right i suppose i mean how could anyone outside of this sub be taking it seriously dont have to be an asshole about it btw
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do you have government statistics to back up that claim its not true
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course it exists in very small insignificant and extremely rare ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i dont ignore it i dont know it show me do you ignore these statistics cops killed nearly twice as many whites as blacks in according to data compiled by the washington post percent of the victims of fatal police shootings were white while percent were black the majority of these victims had a gun or were armed or otherwise threatening the officer with potentially lethal force according to mac donald in a speech at hillsdale college now you may look at this and think but black people make up like of the population doesnt that mean racism well statistics from the bureau of justice statistics show that black people are responsible for of murders and of assaults in the largest counties in the country even though comprising of the population in these counties more whites and hispanics die from police homicides than blacks of white and hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers black and hispanic police officers are more likely to fire a gun at blacks than white officers this is according to a department of justice report in about the philadelphia police department and is further confirmed that by a study conducted university of pennsylvania criminologist greg ridgeway in that determined black cops were times more likely to fire a gun than other cops at a crime scene blacks are more likely to kill cops than be killed by cops this is according to fbi data which also found that percent of cop killers are black the police officer is times more likely to be killed by a black than a cop killing an unarmed black person please note a lot of this has been copy pasted from other sources primarily the daily wire its easy to see police officers as enemy occupiers to think of the world as white versus black but thats not how it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like anyone who is in politics has a truth record be honest here do you really believe everything obama or hillary tell you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because its only because its something to rip on trump about hardly anyone cared when obama copied governor deval patrick back in obama dont tell me words dont matter i have a dream just words we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words just speeches gov deval patrick we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equaljust words just words we have nothing to fear but fear itselfjust words ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your countryjust words i have a dreamjust words what was obamas response i dont really think this is too big of a deal deval and i do trade ideas all the time and you know hes occasionally used lines of mine i would add ive noticed on occasion sen clinton has used words of mine as well and michelle obama lifted from saul alinsky back in michelle obama and barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be saul alinsky the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wishedfor fantasy of the world as it should be how about joe biden ripping off neil kinnock biden i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright is it because im the first biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree that i was smarter than the rest neil kinnock why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university then pointing to his wife in the audience he continued why is glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick how about hillary tasking from bernie hillary this country belongs to all of us not just those at the top bernie this country belongs to all of us not just the billionaire class thats what this campaign is all about so why do you care when its melania trump but not when democrats do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mature response i like it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahaha thats actually a solid burn nice one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have but honestly you do it youre the one claiming institutional racism on the topic of stopandfrisk what ive seen is people claiming it is institutionally racist because a vast number of the people stopped and frisked are hispanic or black however not at all disproportionate to what demographics are actually committing these crimes now i understand there are a few people who have been stopped and frisked due to racism thats bad but i dont see in any way how it is indicative of institutional racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does that have to do with the plagiarism of numerous politicians
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,implying the last near hour coverage of this topic on cnn is a joke and not them trying make it into a real issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,keep your troll looking ass gutter white women off my page
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary i forgotsuper predatorcriminal clinton or donald honest clowncrazy speechorange man trump this is a shit show

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,would smash then put her in my backpack bih looking all fun size and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,did you read the shit they lifted it wasnt inspiration it was almost verbatim just like melania but the difference is that its apparently okay when shillary and the dumbocraps do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when you and your partner get shot because people are race baiting and blaiming everything on all cops and now your kids dont dont have a dad

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,guys there are a small handful of speech writers in washington they constantly say the same lines obama used entire lines from several politicians several times most politicians do youre all getting worked i actually like trump so at first i enjoyed this but you guys have to realize this is how he gets airtime and spends almost no money right heres examples just focusing on obama id give you the youtube link but all i got is this guys facebook
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,aint no shame in selling worth of taxfree ebtfood stamps for just cash to go buy drugs then i suppose next
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,illegals arent a race though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,surely this will be the thing to sink his candidacy unlike the last times people said this 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont agree with the entire direction of the show but it has its moments the show that comes on afterwards is unbearable though

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah man my cousin raeray be jokin and shit then he pulls out his dick and pisses on your shoes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what funny about this is that white women are seriously appropriating things that black women been had whats worse is that black men are holding the things that white women have appropriated against black women either as negatives or something that black women dont do that they should be doing and can we not forget that white women have literally gotten and continue to get black men killed or put into jail while its black women who are on the front lines holding us down also its white women who really werent doing anything to keep us from being hunted and gunned down even if you managed to successfully pull off the mental gymnastics to date a white woman do you really want to have to explain things that a fellow person of color just understands one final point black women are absolutely beautiful every last thing about them i cant explain why or whyits fuckin magic though so yall can keep your beckys im all about the melanin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course despite of my preferences i wouldnt restrict myself to tall brown eyed brunettes because im not that picky

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the black man painted white is much more relevant to current times they are so confused and derelict as a race that they have to paint themselves white so the other blacks wont rape and beat them just for being blackor to steal their sneakers

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,reposts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you dont have to apologize for justifying the destruction of a successful black community and i wont apologize for being happy when i read articles about white suicides being at record highs and white people overdosing in droves due to the heroin epidemic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like her music and wish she wasnt such a crazy cunt l
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if youre interested in finding the truth then do so i have a feeling youre too far gone tho only care about politics when your favorite sports player or big booty singer pretends to give a fuck too thats not the way to be the ban will last days whether i convince you or not 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,been in bpt my whole life i forgot the only difference a lot of people on reddit and real life is that most of my people who suck up mainstream media like its kanyes nex album and dont have the critical thinking capacity to remain open minded are going to click a button that marks their intended disapproval in a virtual currency that doesnt even exist so keep slaving away to get your upvotes if you think you know youll eventually get your next raise or job or political position with that or some shit ill be fine keeping my sanity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i like how you think as a black person you should be lynched if you didnt suck on hillarys armpitfat why dont you go learn about your history like some
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yet you justify the destruction of black wall street because according to you if white people feel like theyre under attack theyll attack in turn so like i said before you dont have to apologize for justifying the destruction of a successful black community by racist whites and i wont apologize for being happy when i read articles about white suicides being at record highs and white people overdosing in droves due to the heroin epidemic were even
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,roasted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the homos communists etc millions of them were in the exact same fuckin camps as the jews its not as if the jews were in any danger of extinction even by the most optimistic estimates only worldwide were killed the nazis tried to cleanse many groups jews were the largest you know the pink triangle that gays use its from the symbol that the nazis made the jews wear it gets really fucking old hearing about how was uniquely about the jews blm is a completely separate issue the issues affecting black people with respect to eg police violence are unique to black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no ape is a species of primate its overly sensitive people that take it as a racial slur im sorry the woman looks like a damn gorilla at least the shape of her face does
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because hes doing good things for everyone except snowflakes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they didnt throw a pity party sorry bout your feelings
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i subbed here when this place was funny not posting ignorant political shit did no one in this sub pay attention to what was going on during obamas two terms and his administrations involvement destabilizing the middle east where were your lame memes when obama was doing sketchy shit ah never mind he invites rappers to the white house lets give him a pass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just tried it and httpiimgurcomqnkzzrqjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,about the reply i expected probably shoulda thrown some more trend words in there tbh obama lit af fam squad goals bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if i remember their were at different classifications the nazis killed and experimented the experiments are what gave us are modern medicine and pathology from
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sorry but the majority of that is just not true just the same ol trend words thrown out by the media to further divide people neo nazi xenophobic racist mysoginist sexist islamaphobic etc steve bannon is not and nowhere close to be a neo nazi despite what buzzfeed and cnn tell you just yesterday he barred legal yes legal immigrants from entering the us no the executive order also not a muslim ban is suspending visa approval from countries that were selected as security risks by obamas administration and its not permanent just until people can be vetted to see if they are a threat to our country or not what in the world does that have to do with racism and im sure the reason you were misinformed on the executive order is because of the certain media outlets you watch they are the actual reason people are so divided trump has been in the public eye just about his entire life and hes pretty damn old before he ran for president never had any of those terms thrown at him but thank you for providing thought out response instead of the usual ones that get thrown out in this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,those are not as good as the one of the guy killing people in a gay nightclub shouting allah snackbar or the one about the guy who killed a bunch of social workers and mentally disabled people shouting allah snack bar or the other one about the somali who just drove through some people and starting stabbing while shouting allah snackbar yup everything is fine and dandy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when subs become default their mods are overtaken by liberal shills
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre upvoting it because its funny in black culture getting as is frowned upon and seen as a white thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whoop another political one another one nah please fucking stop this shit i come to bpt for some laughs not some snarky fuckbois on twitter that suddenly all on their malcolm x grind
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry to do that to you our first lady is much better looking nowadays so you might look up some pictures of her as eye bleach
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe they shouldnt commit crimes then since the overwhelming majority of the blm protested shootings that media headlines used to whip protestors into frenzies and riots have been found to be justified and were falsely reported before all of the facts were available to journalists including the infamous mike brown hands up dont shoot bullshit that started the whole movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol youre pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then who will the blacks sell their own kind to oh right theres still the spanish
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we think you all look the same too what with the gangster clothesgear you stereotype i stereotype racism goes both ways my friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when you can point to me evidence that accounts for the million person vote discrepancy i will believe it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bpt is so hypocritical sometimes and its posts like this that make me say that yall try to make yourselves out to be opponents of racism but every day i see shit like this generalizing the beliefs of an entire race white people the fact that this kind of stuff is so common and always gets upvotes makes me feel like a lot of you as in those of you who upvote this and post this would be predisposed to hate me even if you didnt know me just because im white the key to end racism isnt just to be racist back thats just childish and makes you a shitty person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lets remember that only white people can be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trump is keeping his campaign promises the only people that are unhappy are the ones who voted for hillary clinton they are butthurt and cant get over the election loss i wrote in bernie sanders the one clinton cheated in the primary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah my theory for the cause of trumps presidency is that it can be split between root causes •fanatical sjws driving people away from voting for democrat when they wouldve voted for clinton if they didnt feel alienated •hillary clinton gambling the presidency on numbers so she didnt have to put any effort into middle america •dnc booting populist candidate for establishment candidate and expecting democrat voters to be too stupid to tell the difference
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what kind of rari
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats what i thought asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe they are sick of the antiwhite undertone in blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trying to stay mentally stable bpt black people tumblr
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shiiett i call that nigga trill bill
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,there is no denying that the past years made people more gravitating towards extremes while trump is a truly terrible president it doesnt make obamas presidency suddenly all good memes and tweets are funny and all but it just looks so strange for an european like me how blended you all are but hey good luck with having no privacy and paying off your student debts

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i voted republican for trump dont think of myself as republican i care about global warming dont mind abortion or gay marriage and i cant fathom how a republican can think of obozo as a good guy he literally has abused executive orders to have people killed he had zero congressional consent for the shit in libya for example

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,youre actually retarded if you truly believe that when people get angry and insult you go for the easiest thing to distinguish between the person you are insulting skin color is one of the first things people can tell about another person so very easy to use while insulting a person like i bet you have used a persons ethnicity as an insult too you are just a hypocrite and clearly have some hate for white people even though you are half white
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this post is some bullshit blacks only beat whites in basketball football and running out on their kids

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one time this one black kid in my pe class was bullying some other kid and i told him to fuck off i got real up in his face and he kept saying to fight him called me a saltine cracker when i walked away from that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what are you talking about are you speaking for the entire human race and their feelings it many contextssituations it gets so overused it is well beyond casual and seemingly impossible to use randomly should nobody use it should only black people be able to use it should only white people be forbidden from using it is it empowering for black people to use it since they claimed the word for themselves therefore taking the power from the word if a white person uses the word out of anger is this undeniable proof that they are racist either consciously or unconsciously if anyone uses this word out of anger does that too imply racism i believe i cant speak for anyoneeveryone other than myself that people have different perspectives when it comes to the nword it seems to have a lot of power depending on the circumstance however it really never appears to have more power then when used in a hateful context when the word is used most by outspoken usually proud racists and also by the very group of people obviously not all or even a majority of it is derogatoryhateful towards its confusing why we keep using the word at all the word needs to just die off already along with the racism it was born from it just keeps people down the the more this toxic word is dragged out wake up sheeple its downwiththenwords
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fucking that monster must be like child birth i know they retain their elasticity and she probably does mad kegels but that things stretched the fuck out bro youd probably be visitor number by now too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,my favorite scene even on rock is when kristina bowden was barefoot and looking for something in a couch he soles were just suddenly right there in the middle of the screen and i almost couldnt take it thought id relax and watch some comedy wind up excusing myself to go fap in the bathroom

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,we outchea
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theyre not the only people who could possibly be hurt by policies he puts in place or things he overturns women muslims lgbt people minorities
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what does it have to do with a meme on bpt because thats what im talking about clearly those are not productive things
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,careful with this we business
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop and frisk among other things but back to you dont get to decide who gets to be afraid if the fear is unjustified you explain to them why just like therapy for phobias you explain why though their feelings are valid its not going to be as bad as they fear and then you provide evidence as to why all without name calling or swearing or insults of any kind
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,still better than leafy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe if the black community got their shit together they would be in the same boat as the white privileged people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not being an asshole but this is the first ive heard of a spike in hate crimes can anyone shed some light on it for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,year olds are retarded you just described half the people on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real i wanna see

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,half these posts i could xpost to rmodernpropaganda for a small but steady karma income tbh oh wait i already do
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you mean the narrative that this country shouldnt be led by a man who was elected through a campaign of hatred racism and misogyny doesnt sound like a bad narrative to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats funny about this is he probably has still worked harder than any person involved with this sub especially the welfare queens and all the dead beat dads and such
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres was a news article on my feed last week praising a year old woman for voting for trump it goes both ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,found the white guy so are there a certain number of hate crimes that have to happen before its allowed to be considered a spike is it or or another number im unaware of i guess i should just ignore what the media reports and assume its all untrue
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just because my mom and dad worked hard for their money doesnt mean that they should keep it especially when there are welfare brats waiting for some handouts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go out and vote for who the old woman who is being investigated by the fbi for not understanding cyber security or the orange reality tv star who says random shit on tv all the time and has never held political office this is the governments fault not ours
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats my local news hahaha and trump were gonna take care of all americans
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like you pay attention any time the police kill a white guy and it happens a lot more
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sub is garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a lot of that shit looks like it was done by trolls or someone trying to look like a white racist ive never seen a trump supporter use whiteamerica lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey guys im downvoting this guys post but its always at the top im gonna tell the mods that ur hacking
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub has become an antiwhite circle jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is unknowingly the most racist sub on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,real talk not gonna take sides on this shit but maybe we should consider putting some kinda rule on these kinds of post i aint against these but every time these are posted and reaches rall this sub turns to shit with shit being thrown from both sides and it aint pretty i dont think ive ever seen a sub lock threads so much now i dont know a whole lot about moderating but maybe theres a function that can stop posts from being viewed in rall cause it would be really useful for taking the toxicity of the sub down
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people overwhelmingly voted against trump youre on a sub pertaining to black culture why are you surprised do unsub i dont think youll be missed
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,stop locking these kinds of threads and people wont make those comments let the white suburban kids get mad because they cant take a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,k
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall cry too much wah
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,literally nobody gives a fuck about what you think or what you do why did you feel the need to announce it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,blm made police accountability a racial issue not me and they continue to use bad examples which discredit them they also dont have strong leadership so you have the extreme blm members bastardizing the movement if it was about police accountability it wouldnt be about race and they could protest all unjust deaths by police and go after the real problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,bye
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,year olds dont do shit for the country except leech and those hundred year olds have been paying taxes for years
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,unconstitutionally policing my god no he wouldnt dare murder americans with drones without charge or trial increase illegal nsa wiretapping and support the harboring of illegalcriminal immigrants would he that would just awful however would we all survive

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whys he being downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its like the episode of boondocks when riley started wearing gangstalicious clothing line well have these young boysmen trying to be cool for their friends by wearing womens clothing when you have straight boysmen wearing clothes like this they start attracting attention from the same sex there isnt a problem with this initially but because of how often this might occur because of the new womensoutfittrend the boy might start to question their own sexuality for a reason that couldve been avoided altogether do i have a problem with gay men wearing womens clothing no because thats fine and theyre attracting the attention they want to attract do i have a problem with young boysmen not really grasping what exactly it is theyre wearing and who they look up to and blindly following behind them yes because that could fuck them up the only thing i could compare it to is someone like nicki minaj twerking on an older dude and then young girls lets say and under start twerking on boys the same age as them i just dont believe its a healthy progression of growth since they have no idea what theyre doing and theyre just blindly following their idols

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wasnt even remotely implying you were the one whining about downvotes reading comprehension a bit low i dont give a fuck if you need my input or reply the reply button is there for users to interact and reply with each other how are you a mod when you cant even handle someone replying to you so maybe shut your mouth and mind your own business instead of giving out advice that no one asked for wow perhaps the user above the one whose comment you removed sneakily but couldnt resist leaving the snarky comment reply didnt ask for your reply or advice perhaps next time ask him he could have the same ultra sensitive standards you clearly have
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you know how that shit goes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,is it ok if im white and i do this

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i was stuck on aijah for a while cause i thought it was relevant damn names confusin as hell nowadays
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how do people like this even get accepted into college
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,as muhammad ali said when asked about his visit to africa and what he thought of it there thank god my granddaddy got on that boat
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,eyeezha the fuck aijah fucks sake come on
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol he made actual coherent points and you responded with namecalling insults and baseless accusations of racism hold this l youve earned it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except for the fact that you know its not especially since white victims are overrepresented in statistics of police shootings while black victims are underrepresented as a percentage of police encounters by both but hey fuck actual statistics if they dont play into the narrative amiright
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rest assured its all just bullshit and memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,take your cracker ass back to rmayonnaise then
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but she has hot sauce

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha because this sub doesnt joke about infidelity in the black community dont project too hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,would bang
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hot sauce for hillary clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they call themselves trump supporters now
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no black people anywhere in this
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a less black bill nye did i read that right
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hillary clinton won a larger percentage of the black vote than the first black president of the united states in multiple states during the primary she demolished sanders in the black vote the black vote is a very significant reason why she is even the democratic nominee in the first place it would come as absolutely no surprise if she gets well over of the black vote in the general election she consistently polls that well with black people after all pretending niggas dont like hillary is just ignoring an abundance of objective facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,weezy got the shit end of the stick hes the only black kid in the hood who has to give his fake dad child support money

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,travyon was an ape
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black people are functionally retarded glad dollar trump is gonna murder them lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,remember when obama first won in and republicans were pushing the narrative that obama was an islamic communist that wanted to take away your guns and years went by and nothing happened if you genuinely believed that trump was some kind of hitlerian neofascist bent on genocide you would have either moved or joined some kind of militia
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what happened to if you dont like it you can leave
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i might get banned for this i dont know maybe the mods will let it slide who cares the mods are pretty meh on this sub like they enforce rules to an extent but they shitpost and race bait petty often mglln or whatever the fuck letters it is literally made a post specifically to insult white people and race bait and just made fun of users when they got angry what a piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,right and hes replying to a post saying you shouldnt be able to

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,like of voters voted hillary changing the age to would be dumb af i know this shits a joke but its a shitty one so im gonna ruin it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,free at last free at last thank trump almighty the god emperor we are free at last
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats because if white people admitted to voting for trump theyd be labeled as racist or whatever other bullshit simply because they have hope he will do a better job than shillary fucking clinton this is why the result seemingly came out of nowhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall right now i really hate this trump guy because he wants to isolate groups of people and treat them differently because of the color of their skin where they live and who they want to marry also yall lets isolate and treat people different based on where they live and the color of their skin just going to leave this here whoever fights with monsters should see to it that he does not become a monster in the process and when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no one in this sub has met their father
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and black people love to find racism in every little comments when racism isnt there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes not getting rid of obamacare because he hates blacks hes doing it because people like me are now paying up the ass for healthcare where the quality hasnt changed hes leaving abortions up to the states not making them legal or illegal i dont even know what youre trying to say for homophobic policies have to be more clear the wall is being made to stop illegal immigration if people want to migrate to the us they should have to do it like every other legally documented immigrant plus it helps stops flow of drugs from cartels none of what you just said is true at all you are buying into the bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i have no problem with ridiculous write in votes if you have two candidates that are shit i respect the person that votes for mickey mouse more than the person that stays home
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if we counted only the votes of millennials aged trump would have had electoral votes this is post is some headass

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,good i hope not i dont care what race sex or whatever you call yourself their is nothing okay with this we need to stop this now please let other know that at no point in time is it okay for people to do this to one another because god forbid they have a different opinion you dont answer violence with more violence because who knows what may beget it please also ignore what the media is doing race baiting fucks fuck im so mad at shit like this people need to stop being fucking pawns to power get some foresight and deductive reasoning and see you are being played
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lookie lookie we got cookies
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its amusing how people concerned with being labelled by the color of their skin use the color of someones skin as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he took over and the unemployment rate was he averaged a unemployment rate his entire presidency he made cops lives worthless he made healthcare unaffordable for a lot of people he made our country more racist and divided than its been in a long time its the worse its ever been in my lifetime of course it was worse back before i was alive he added trillion to the national debt anything else i should mention
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair a dead gorilla would probably have better than either outcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they actually are because obama but you are clearly too retarded to understand that how come blm didnt start any other time do you think its a coincidence it started just randomly while he was in office every time a thug died he went on tv and bashed the police force and praised these pos robbersthugsthiefsmurders but eh whatever thank god hes about to be done
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oooueww

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,watermelon fried chicken cornbread and collard greens blacks fried rice cats dogs chinese people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,that sign is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,notallavocados

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i hate this subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ironic racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if mlk we are alive today
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,except he was non violent and well thought out today you cannot even speak to a sjw without being called a racist bigot and that closed mindedness is why they lost the election people got tired of being silenced by the lefts idiotic labels
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha lets call out racists by being racist to them that will make them listen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah mlk was nothing like the extreme fuck all white people sjwblm extremists today he would smack you in the mouth for suggesting it too
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the sign is racist itself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yall should stereotype white people more it makes em less racist

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im white i am not racist but thanks reddit for the insult im a male i am not a misogynist but thanks reddit for the stereotype im an american gun owner i wont shoot up a school or kill any innocent people but thanks reddit for thinking so progressively you create the world you want to see maybe try pulling your head out of your ass to get a better view
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,media tells me if i join their cause ill be singled out and beaten on the streets for being white

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why you deleting comments pointing out how stupid this is specifically the comment put fried chicken in the work place so black ppl will get a job

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,put watermelon on racism so black people will pay attention see they both are racist stupid statements
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dae think all white people are racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,keep demonizing us for being white and we will keep voting people like trump into office
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fighting racism with racism worked for mlk oh wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the democrats are acting like a bunch of little bitches i dont remember republicans burning american flags when obama won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the salt is real
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,go take a history or econ class you ignorant fuck they make no difference yeah they do again go to school dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doing the same thing just makes shit worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shit whats worse is that of blacks and of latinos voted for trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mglln im sorry to tell you but vines dead also vine sucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,feels bad feels sad people are letting their emotions get the better of them and while it may feel good to vent the enemies people make and the friendships they ruin are going to be felt for a lot longer than the afterglow of telling whitey to fuck off if all the same voters who came out for obama came out for clinton this wouldnt be a problem so perhaps a bit less fuck whitey and bit more vote or this shit will happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont come back you fucking inbreds
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,oh boy another white people dont use seasoning thread yall be safe out there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes trump is a spiritcooker
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i feel the same way makeamericagreatagain
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,things i think obama looked like more of a bitch after making fun of trumps chances of being president also nobody actually believes the world is years old politicians claim to believe it to please their stupid constituents who only believe it because they think everyone around them including their political leaders believes it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,cos you say women when you really mean fat women
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,difference is the stereotypes about blacks are true and yes i voted for trump to put down the sjwblacklivesmatter delusion
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but they are look at the protests you guys brought this on yourselves whites hold the keys to this country
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,obamas insults lead to him running
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im happy he won
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and youll end up like trayvon
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so you could say trump did get the last laugh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for real there are black people on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i envy him he really is living a dream lots of money buildings a a wife and now president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont wonder the people who are mad are leftist race agitators who suffer from white race envy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rmeirl go get your karma boys
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,sorry the numbers dont fit your narrative a lesser share of blacks hispanics young people and women voted for her than obama less women think about that if their are enough racists to determine the election why did states that voted obama in twice suddenly switch to trump its class politics this time like everyones tried to tell them since the primaries not the divisive identity politics of the regressive left
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im just smarter than you not sure if youre illeterate or you just make up facts but here are the real ones just compare the white swing with the rest
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,dont act like hillary is a saint
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,what happened to the message clinton supporters sent of being kind to each other and triumph with love or did everyone forget that part
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,first it was nobody really thought trump had a chance of winning now its the majority of people would have expected a clinton win looks like you gonna have to eat your words just like obama did
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive seen some dumb people in my life but this is a new low someone who doesnt understand numbers holy shit do you not understand that if trump only got the white vote he would have lost elections are not just about which demographic votes in favour of a candidate
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if the companies want to stay in america which they will with the lowering of corporate tax they are gonna have to sure the company is not gonna be able to hire as many workers as they would for example in mexico or china and naturally this will hurt the companies short term it is important to note however that no where in the world will companies enjoy the same lenient laws and policies along side the light taxing as in america consumerism will thrive without the artificial lifesupport of welfare and i believe that this is going to work very well despite your skin colour religion or gender if you work hard you will be able to prosper in trumps america
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ah the classic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah i dont post very often and this is actually my first time ive posted on bpt but from my impression most people on this sub black or not love to act as theyre bloods or crips

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,take
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you memeing or serious i thought it was great that he let them have their say at a public event no other candidate would have done that maybe the image was somewhat unfair to him but blm needs to get as much of an audience as possible to get their goals and bernie was the only guy who sympathized with that i thought that incident just showed he was the only one to understand that being a leader doesnt always mean talking sometimes it means listening
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,shadynasty ftfy
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,never knew tumblr and feminism was leaking in rblackpeopletwitter contain your cancer please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats why i said i wouldnt be giving up much obviously i have what ever default privilege you get for being white but a lot is thrown out when youre at the bottom of the economic ladder
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this wasnt english
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he stole the show and i fear for his safety from the clintons
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,of course i wouldnt its not that i have anything against people of color its just that well im white ive always been white why would i want to change that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,problem child
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this shit supposed to make white people feel bad for being white foh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao right the idea of white privilege triggers white people so much no being white does not guarantee you a perfect life but you definitely have advantages grow up and realize that
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,would a black person trade skin with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this subreddit is worse than facebook most of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but when rachel dolezal doing it everyone accusing her of racism and black face and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,can we avoid white guilt please of course racism exists of course its less advantageous to be black in america but please dont make people feel guilty for something they cant control white people cant control being white as much as any race can control their own race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nobody said that though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just a poll by votes how many here believe only white people can be racist cause as a white dude ive heard my black friends say that and it struck me as a really racist thing to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,believe me they do not everywhere is america bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,barack comes from nothing to become president and yet people still bitching about white privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably better rich with that oil money and child brides

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itd be the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wow chris rock really is funny eh xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please read more comment sections about race pretty please
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,keep holding yourself down with that mentality and its unlikely that things will improve if you take on a different perspective a more introspective one you might see better days no one or no group of people is going to lift you up in life thats all up to you ultimately you are what you make yourself a man with two foreign names and black skin became the leader of the free world with a voter pool dominated by white people and that was years ago starting out poor is a legitimate struggle but the only system that actively holds you down is your imagination it does feel good to have a sense of moral high ground a victim complex is also very popular these days oh well back to working toward a better future for myself without complaining
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lmao at all these white tears that they feel guilty nobody cares lol number one no one is saying that you shouldnt be white or that you need to control your whiteness be as white as you want to be what people are saying is that you need to acknowledge your white privilege so we can take steps towards changing it if acknowledging your white privilege makes you feel guilty then so be it just because you didnt ask for your white privilege doesnt mean that we suddenly arent allowed to talk about it when it affects us whether you asked for it or not its real and its fucked up shit number two keep in mind that when you ask people of color to not talk about your white privilege because it makes you feel bad you tell us to put white comfort and happiness above our own becausei guess its more important to make sure that you dont feel bad than it is for me to make sure that i am treated the same as you in life so your feelings are more important than my literal life sorry bruh but nah save them tears for your pillow
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so real talk when did this sub go from being funny things black people or people pretending to be black people post on twitter to being way to political and unfunny did i miss some drama or what
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,thats ridiculous is it white privilege or lack of black privilege i dont understand seems like the argument perpetually changes to make sure people are on track with black people having total shit lives and the victims of everything around them at least stay consistent with what to blame
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,privilege really is the wrong word for it white people dont have something that we are lacking its more like they start at and in instances the rest of us start at i dont understand getting mad at them for it unless one was actively trying to promote holding minorities back
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,brown and named mohammed damn son thats a double whammy personally i wouldnt trade yeah i know privilege and all that but thats just because i like being me if i looked different than how i do currently id feel like a different person idk if that makes sense tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i would change skins because then i would have a respectable sized dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and the white people that are murdered in south africa because they are white thats not racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah nicki minaj is kinda ugly
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes a artificial meme the media did all these interviews with him because he said he was leaning trump but now hes leaning hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so all the jokes about lol white kid reaching in backpack hes about to shoot up the school isnt racist what about the mentality that whites are trying to put themselves above black people its pretty tiring that people are trying so hard to start issues between whites and blacks in the real world outside of the internet ive never once seen any hostility between any races in fact ive noticed that races seem pretty welcome to one another its almost like being a decent person yields positive results no matter who youre interacting with
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,study after study alright buddy link me something thats peer reviewed and not a fuckin buzzfeed or slate article you read that one time
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,depends what mohammad does i mean there are many affirmative action programs to help mohammad out that wont even look twice at billy blue eyes
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,untrue soo untrue if i see a black guy who is well put together i absolutely think he is wealthier and more ok than the white guy sagging his pants with unkempt hair and raggedy clothes maybe you are the one who has the biases and not everybody else
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yes that is what all white people believe every single one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,black on black crime

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im sorry i dont worry about my social standing in comparison to others lol i literally just go about my days and do my thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no i would definitely be aware of racism if it happened in front of my face in person ive never seen a racist situation in person online no shit its al over the place i moved from massachusetts to south redneck ga and obviously the old people were racist when talking to other whites but the people my age in school didnt give a shit id actually be surprised if people in their have grown up with racial tension ive moved around a lot in my life and have been to many different schools and honestly i believe that our generation could care less about a persons race older people are obviously a different story
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,smh ive been saying this for years mglln is by far the worst shitposter on this sub im gonna contact hillary and get this boi suicided

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,these memes are always so funny cause you know the dude no homo has more than enough dick for that ivory rump and hes just imitating what would happen with the dudes trying to holler at her
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah why not raceethinictybased scholarships and grants racial specific national establishments broadcasting channels immunity to joke about white people without backlash affirmative action safe spaces specialized months and holidays etc

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,jesus christ
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nigga the fact that shes white in general
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well statistically speaking black people are more likely to commit crime and statistically speaking it is mainly poor black people who commit those crimes statistically speaking a hungry lion is more likely to try to eat you than a hippo so you would probably be more nervous around a hungry looking lion than a hippo some biases are logical
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,tbh nicki startin to get a lil ugly too she just thick as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if its only the skin and not the inferior monkey brain maybe xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wouldnt want an afro either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you for real if nothing else changed about me id change skin colors in a heartbeat i took the lsat on a whim got a pretty good score but decided not to go to pursue what i actually wanted to do but no way in hell im turning down yale law full scholarship
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do i get a big black dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah what assholes im sure everyone downvoting me would feel the same walking down a rich neoghborhood block with mostly white people at night wearing a rolex as they would if they walked down a high crime area of chicago and had a shirtless black guy with face tatoos eye them down as they walked with the rolex it would be so racist to assume that he might rob you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lol has anyone ever heard a live human being actually say racism doesnt exist what a retarded fucking post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah if you act like a thug ppl will stay away from you and treat you differently if you act like a decent human being the majority of ppl really dont care and will even give you the benefit of the doubt but no keep the we be black n dey all be racis shit going right this sub is a scourge on black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ive said it before and ill say it again could you imagine what the gop would have said in if obama had five kids from three wives
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,maybe black people should stop being statistically so violent and bad at everything people might not actually be hesitant to give them jobs or rides in taxis then funny how white people are only racist to blacks but not to asians
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,please define white privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why what is your proof
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont want to change my skin color so i am racist flawless logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i say that to myself every time i looked in a mirror yes i have issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn i love this meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think it qualifies because its just another not funny political post that the mods allow to be shoehorned into their sub because it aligns with their own political leanings ill be so glad to browse an us electionfree reddit and bpt again come january
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,michael cuck black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is so stupid lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ok as far as generalizations go this is probably one of the laziest if the subject was white person id be fine with it but to just call all white people racist for the sake of a joke just seems needlessly bitter even if its not being serious if the point is to make sweepingly stereotypical jokes about white people then its fine as metahumor as a counter to racist humor but even then metahumor can only be funny for so long since the goal is always the same making fun of a type of joke and racist humor is both easily made and easily parodied eventually both kinds just start to get lazy and repetitive if they dont get more creative with their delivery then only the people who want it to be funny will actually find it funny if however the intention was just to trigger white people by calling them all racist then id say job well done because it at least worked on me i am writing this comment after all i just hope the op knows that what the joke implies isnt actually true i also hope that anybody who sees the post doesnt take it as more than a joke im sorry for this rant of a comment i guess im just tired of every joke thats considered hilarious and gets a free pass because the punchline or the subject is white people are racist regardless of effort or creativity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,if it came with a bbc sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nice bait
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rcringeanarchy no one believes racism is dead this is such a shit post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,do i get a bigger dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whats fucking over immigrants is waiting years in ins lines because of fucking illegals and the libtards that protect them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,now even if people treated me equally why would anyone want to be black if given a choice i mean there is a reason people choose the type of dog breed they are all loved equally but not by everyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,here is the but it really doesnt change much lol also the dude with the shades is part of this sad little demonstration which was held at uci a day ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,manymost black africans ive met hate black american culture are they racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,fuck her to death
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because all southerners are the same which is bigoted pieces of shit and your isolated experience is the only valid experience and if anyone experienced anything else that goes against your experience and interpretation of such its obviously false
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,damn that structured institutional racism failed when a black man became president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its a two way street almost like america is this big huge thing where everything blends with everything elselike a melting pot its why you got black dudes saying dude its why we got gifs of a bunch of black guys in a kitchen skateboarding and the point of the gif wasnt about black guys skateboarding its why jimmy hendrix is a rock and roll legend and on and on and on but you keep pretending white people have no culture and when anything black gets popular is coopted and should get a fucking plaque in the black coolness hall of fame sad thing is you probably dont even understand how much your bigoted perspective is part of the problem creating more race based division than anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wtf this sub has gone so downhill recently time to actually unsub feelsbadman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,are you fucking shitting me were at a point now where people can be racist against themselves how the fuck is that an issue when people are supposedly thinking this about themselves fucking hell what will you imbeciles come up with next
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,would you be willing to give up your kinkilling ganstagansta thug life for a white collar shirt and a pillow key i would trade white skin for black then brush up on my resume get some regular respectful clothes that dont reflect that im part of a criminallyrecognized mediafostered culture and go apply for some good jobs with the skills ive studied and practiced
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just ignore it thats the deal with this subreddit counter culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,music is a constantly evolving beast built on and influenced by all of its various angles black american music was just one influence of early rock and black american music had its own influences if anything it exemplifies exactly what im talking about with both black and white cultures feeding and morphing different aspects of each other there is no recognition required its all american culture we as americans of various skin tones adopt as much as we create rarely is there ever any sourced recognition as its not needed if there is a part of black culture that isnt adopted by white culture its not mainstream and is less favourably looked upon that goes for anything you dont think most people from urban coastal areas where most of the population is view some aspects of deep south country culture as less favourable music is the most obvious example of this time and again music is such a perfect example music isnt created in a vacuum rap music didnt come about with no white peoples influence including sound engineers and producers and such not to mention the songs they were sampling from to begin with that nonblack people dont understand why they cant use the n word lol youre white and grew up in a nice neighborhood didnt you i love getting schooled about black culture by middle class white people its just the best i grew up poor af in ny everyone of every racial background called each other and everybody nigga and nobody looked twice about it yo that chinese nigga over there is cool as hell everyone can talk with whatever vernacular they want nobody own a got damn thing definitely sharing culture is necessary its not necessary it is the very foundation of this country its what we are and what we do anyone talking about cultural appropriation needs to gtfo or starting telling black people not to wear suits speak with words of white origins or they need to attribute all the aspects of their culture that come from white people to me that sounds about as stupid as the nonsense about white people your saying to me i see a group of black kids skateboarding and i smile i see a black president and i smile i see a white dude respected as one of the best rappers in the game and i smile thats progress and we are gonna keep making progress in spite of people like you that want to try and divide us and divide us based on skin tone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for every racist here there are handwringing redditors who swear everyone here is racist except them

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,allegedly is the white version of dinn do nuffin
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,caption this as cuck and it will make it to the top of rthedonald
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,out a ring in a hoe what is this some ho propaganda
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,how are you gonna call him african when you just quoted them arguing about jamaica
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i just witnessed a man buying ciggarettes and liquor with food stamps while his kid was with him guess the race
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because sexism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just witnessed someone stealing a bicycle and the robbing a store lets play guess their ethnicity black black black
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i dont understand these words
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,still a hoe though
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is the problem with racism in the world im not but hurt by this at all what i am upset about is your comment if this was reversed against blacks of hispanic no one would dispute that its racist but since its against whites its considered fine and white people who are offended are butthurt if you want racism to end stop supporting people making fun of whites and tearing people making a joke about blacks to shreds racism is the poor treatment or violence of people of a particular race not the poor treatment of blacks and so called minorities by saying you cant be racist toward whites means you think whites are better than other races which is not true i dont see people for what colour their skin is ive lived in canada all my life and wasnt taught not to be mean to black people i was just taught not to be mean until you stop separating all these races into different groups there will always be racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trayvon is still dead so i guess every day is a holiday
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,u cant be racist if ur black duh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,found the thot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you are def of butt hurt lmfao you braindead fuck you cant joke about black people being racist thats racist you are banned from rblackpeoplewitter lmfao butt hurt ass pussy 😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its classic hoism and the guy could be described as jealous paranoid or controlling
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,uh what is all alex
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,then youre no better than people making those jokes why not be the bigger person
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,came from rall and have literally no idea who this guy is or what the joke is nobody explained it either
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,isnt she basically saying you can be a controlling asshole to her if youre married to her i think theyre both wrong lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,nah this is why you dont battle eminem just listen to those lyrics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just watched someone sling dope in line at the welfare office lets play guess their ethnicity
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,who is frank ocean and what does he matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,lyke ikrrrrrr i cant evennn
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think he was getting his ass beat and thats why he shot him
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he did the right thing we dont live in an honour based society anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,he was being attacked with a brick iirc he was struck first based on earlier news reports and what i watched of the trial all the testimony against him was later thrown out as it was outright lies or hearsay
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah a lot of people thought that because the media got a lot of money to make a big deal of it stand your ground laws are actually a good thing and im surprised more states dont have them many do but i wish mine did all it says is you have no duty to retreat if someone is trying to harm or kill you which seems to make sense upfront but where it really helps is when youre in the moment you might not actually be thinking clearly and see an escape route that a prosecutor will try to use against you saying you could have run away im of the opinion that if someone is trying to kill you i shouldnt need to examine every possible avenue surrounding me to see if i can escape sorry for going on a tangent since this wasnt what was used with zimmerman but i hate that case because now when people hear stand you ground they think its a bad thing like anything it can be used wrongly but overall its a good thing for citizens
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,a person got shot and robbed lets guess the ethnicity white black hispanic asian
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,legitimately shocked that this discussion isnt getting downvoted to oblivion on this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no im brown
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i am white and sometimes i wonder what the hell is wrong with certain black people i also wonder what the hell is wrong with certain white people i dont think white people have a lock on acting ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so you can flimflam the zimmerman
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trayvon also isnt just a kid like the pictures they used of him when he was and he was almost over feet tall and a football player he could kick ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,psh dem niggas waiting to see whos drunk and ready to smash
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,to be fair he only shot trayvon once to stop him from beating him to death on the pavement zimmerman is a really small guy and trayvon was almost over six feet tall and a football player trayvon couldve easily survived the one bullet but got unlucky
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,itt salty white people lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,you guys gots it all wrong those guys are trying to calls dibs i the drunk big bootie girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man someone been posting a lot of this guys tweets mediocre
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i still dont understand the hype for this man yall grown ass men acting like justin bieber fans this is a high pitched singing nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but thats not what happened so we cant pretend to know
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the theme of all of these types of posts on rblackpeopletwitter is in fact that white folks be cray implying that there is something particularly crazy about white people in contrast to black people im not saying im offended by these posts or want to report them for racism like some other white redditors tend to do once these posts hit rall because that is just lame but yes the implication of these posts is that white people just happen to have some sort of crackergwailogringo edge on acting nuts as if black people or any other ethnic group is somehow a greater standard bearer of rationality in reality every group is capable of having people within who are ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because a year old lb highschool football player that looks like this is a kid thats why im always confused about this kid shit because zimmerman was inches shorter and lbs overweight looking at someone who was taller faster and stronger than him but yeah all you saw were photos of tray at
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,his skills were ineffective against a year old too trayvon was beating his ass and instead of taking it after he started shit he shoots him like the bitch made punk that he is if i ever meet him im punching him in the fucking face too i think that should be a rule every decent american should punch him in his fat bitch face every time he pops up somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rwhitepeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,mayonnaise packets
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whos frank ocean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,some one needs to shoot this guy i dont want to be and have kids watching his show with no clue what a scumbag shit murderer he is

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,just go about your life and listen to it when it comes out ive been waiting years for a tool album everything will be okay grown men acting like teenage girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,haha d all of the above and thats the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,no prejudice and racismageismsexism are not the same things racismsexismetc are systemic power dynamics that award privilege to some and take privilege from others
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,trayvon martin would be years old if he didnt take a mans head and beaten it into the pavement before being shot
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is not black people twitter material lol this is some white boy anti social bs
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the shilling for this show on reddit boggles my mind
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,why dont they shoot each other like us
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,which of these candidates is least likely to keep their promises ho would you vote for for president
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,killing an unarmed kid that was assaulting him quite violently ftfy

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i would by zimmerman a beer that is for damn sure cleaning up our streets of scum

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whos frank ocean
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,• hates salads • sits on you as punishment for repeatedly getting salads • now in an abusive relationships
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,well hes not wrong hes just an asshole

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,man i doubt this shits getting locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,one could argue that hillary is just as bad as trump considering shes not destroying him right now when youre losingtied with trump you know you suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the best part about trump winning is the cry babies like you
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,instead he introduced a law that caused everyones heath insurance rates to skyrocket and added trillion to our national debt keeping it real yo

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,less than trump ohnonono where do i begin well since you brought up emails we can start there you are correct that she hasnt be charged comey recommended no charges but what if i told you there was reason to believe comey and likely others in the head of the fbi was in the game with hillary thats a discussion in of itself i dont want to borelose you on the first scandal so ill go onto the next the clinton foundation here we have a situation where two politicians used their political standing and office as a service to domestic and foreign parties in exchange for donations these parties donate to the foundation for a good cause and in return gain permits positions funds tarp the like there is a whole documentary dedicated to this foundation and i have barely scraped the surface of what its about next speaking of emails how about those democratic national committee emails the ones where hillary and the dnc colluded and conspired to cheat bernie sanders out of the nomination httpswikileaksorgdncemails that nice lady not nice debbie from the dnc who stepped down after the leaks was given a nice position in hillarys campaign then we have the controversy in libya where hillary as secretary of state decided to help overthrow gaddafi this lead to the eventual instability in the region which nurtured the growth of isis and other combatants then you have her wall street speeches the ones of which she refuses to release the transcripts for then you have her on video fearmongering and calling blacks superpredators during a speech where she is supporting the violent crime control and law enforcement act im pretty tired and i could probably think of at least more actually news worthy scandals hillary has been involved in this doesnt even include bills scandals such as his dealings in haiti and really fucking things up for the communities down there and again the bill

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,people are angry i keep repeating it but honestly i think it all started as viral marketing for the new steven king movie it with the clown its obviously taken on a whole other life since then because now people are being hurt and clowns are starting to get shot the sightings are happening in almost every city now apparently this particular clown is apologizing for his disgraceful behavior

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,drunk lives matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,for almost years the united states has been conducting an interesting experiment the subjects of the experiment black people and workingclass whites the hypothesis to be tested can a people taken from the jungles of africa and forced into slavery be fully integrated as citizens in a majority white population the whites were descendants of europeans who had created a majestic civilization the former slaves had been tribal peoples with no written language and virtually no intellectual achievements acting on a policy that was not fair to either group the government released newly freed black people into a white society that saw them as inferiors america has struggled with racial discord ever since decade after decade the problems persisted but the experimenters never gave up they insisted that if they could find the right formula the experiment would work and concocted program after program to get the result they wanted they created the freedmans bureau passed civil rights laws tried to build the great society declared war on poverty ordered race preferences built housing projects and tried midnight basketball their new laws intruded into peoples lives in ways that would have been otherwise unthinkable they called in national guard troops to enforce school integration they outlawed freedom of association over the protests of parents they put white children on buses and sent them to black schools and vice versa they tried with money special programs relaxed standards and endless hand wringing to close the achievement gap to keep white backlash in check they began punishing public and even private statements on race they hung up orwellian public banners that commanded whites to celebrate diversity and say no to racism nothing was off limits if it might salvage the experiment some thought that what web du bois called the talented tenth would lead the way for black people a group of elite educated blacks would knock down doors of opportunity and show the world what blacks were capable of there is a talented tenth they are the black americans who have become entrepreneurs lawyers doctors and scientists but ten percent is not enough for the experiment to work the ten percent has to be followed by a critical mass of people who can hold middleclass jobs and promote social stability that is what is missing through the years too many black people continue to show an inability to function and prosper in a culture unsuited to them detroit is bankrupt the south side of chicago is a war zone and the vast majority of black cities all over america are beset by degeneracy and violence and blacks never take responsibility for their failures instead they lash out in anger and resentment across the generations and across the country as we have seen in detroit watts newark los angeles cincinnati ferguson and now baltimore rioting and looting are just one racial incident away the white elite would tell us that this doesnt mean the experiment has failed we just have to try harder we need more money more time more understanding more programs and more opportunities but nothing changes no matter how much money is spent no matter how many laws are passed no matter how many black geniuses are portrayed on tv and no matter who is president some argue its a problem of culture as if culture creates peoples behavior instead of the other way around others blame white privilege but since when the elites opened americas doors to the third world immigrants from asia and india–people who are not white not rich and not connected–have quietly succeeded while the children of these people are winning spelling bees and getting top scores on the sat black youths are committing half the countrys violent crime–crime which includes viciously punching random white people on the street for the thrill of it that has nothing to do with poverty the experiment has failed not because of culture or white privilege or racism the fundamental problem is that white people and black people are different they differ intellectually and temperamentally these differences result in permanent social incompatibility our rulers dont seem to understand just how tired their white subjects are with this experiment they dont understand that white people arent out to get black people they are just exhausted with them they are exhausted by the social pathologies the violence the endless complaints and the blind racial solidarity the bottomless pit of grievances the excuses and the reflexive animosity the elites explain everything with racism and refuse to believe that white frustration could soon reach the boiling point

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,they probably all have jobs too

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,its not that many young black people want to work for the gop its that not many young black people want to work
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so now its considered special if a father does what hes supposed to do

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is stupid and racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,til political figures never go to any event ever other than their party events ever not once they never speak at their alma mater they never go to community events in their home town they never go to youth outreach programs nope its just gop event after gop event ad infinitum
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,saying all lives matter isnt racist you fuckin idiots
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this is an image of two gay men waking up early in the morning to do someones hair how does that dispel any stereotypes

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,wut
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this genuinely made me disgusted
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,whoa man my black itchy trigger finger can only take so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems harsh
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist mods purging this thread oh wait only white people can be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when parents split up it hurts the children it may be true where there are cases the parents are so bad that splitting up is better for the kids than staying together but that just means youre a slightly less horrible parent when parents cant stay together to raise their children it means either a they werent ready to be parents in the first place b they developed new priorities since becoming parents such as fucking the dude down the street or c something out of their control happened like mental illness or something one of those is forgivable but for the most part when parents split up its because they are prioritizing other thing ahead of their children
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,this sub is racist af racism hiding behind its just a prank bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it looks safe in there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,comments getting deleted for calling out the blatant racism apparently this sub is a oneway street with how this shit is handled
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ahh white people are into some wickedly kinky stuff in the bedroom in case you dont knownever seen porn and done a comparisonfor science there are maybe like freaky black girls the rest of the super freaks in mainstream porn are white i heard picks up his bible and mutters under his breath about how yall need jesus

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,when the whole squad has a clean record and a good relationship with their father
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,yeah who does that black guy think he isnot understanding how racist hes being against himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think the anger is more directed at the hypocrisy than the content of the joke people would flip shit if a group of black people were posted with a caption that said when the whole squad doesnt know how to swim but got together for that fried chicken and watermelon anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,it still fits my outrage narrative he shluld have gotten the same punishment the girls did although i actually think the punishment itself was a bit harsh but seriously people need to realise black people are not a monolith that think together one black dude cannot issue a universal hood pass and this whole generation needs to remember that people that dont know you cant tell youre doing or wearing something ironically
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,at least they arent racist terrorists out killing cops across america fuck blm
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hey we may not be able to say certain things like the nword but at least we get to say happy fathers day dad and thanks for the warning officer
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im glad when police officers kill black people its riot worthy but when black people kill police officers i just need a safe space
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the commenter just had to bring stereotypes into it

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i wonder what the fatherless rate is in this picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,on the bright side crime is probably very low there
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,hes banning everyone it really shows theyre massive weak pussies that cant handle it when people dish it back to them
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,seems like the mods are more triggered than anyone else judging by the amount of jokes youve deleted in this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so youve just said your dad was a terrible parent thanks for agreeing with my post
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,get a job
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,on the other side of the spectrum theres rimgoingtohellforthis for reciprocal memes

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,send me some screen caps because i dont even buy it also wtf are dudebros how do you even know that any of them identify as a dude or a bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,and being insanely racist is your bonus
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rule no racism except when its against white people now downvote me

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,rcringe
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,but that doesnt fit this subs bullshit blm requirement
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,doesnt dispel yall horrible misunderstanding of math or statistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im not upset its just ironic that this sub is so vehemently against racism and freak out when even the slightest racism towards blacks is shown but everybody has a field day when its racist towards whites it just shows the hypocrisy of this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,so does that mean that there is a black version of this same image with a specific sex position preference and condiment preference
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,not as hard as my dick when your mums sucking it
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,privileged work in an unpaid internship choose one
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,probably because you have iq of mayonnaise
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,im white and i think its hilarious black people dont have jobs so they cant be in that photo
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i think i partly switched to republican because on the whole they are more goodlooking sure theres rednecks but it far outweighs the neckbeards femiwhales and edgelords
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the irony of you deleting this response seems like the mods are more triggered than anyone else judging by the amount of jokes youve deleted in this thread in before ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,ahwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww poor butthurt mod feigning authority by banning people and claiming that theyre the salty ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,i doesnt dispell anything its just an extremely rare occurrence good for this couple and good for these daughters but it will not erase statistics

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,theres no way that was meant as anything but a joke i refuse to believe someone is so god damn stupid that they would take that picture thinking it would fool anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,the stereotype of white people doing harmless weird stuff doesnt perpetuate a stereotype of people that contributes to racial policing and miscarriage of justice he never said it did get off your high horse and have fun thats what this sub is for
BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,racist pricks

BlackPeopleTwitter,removed,because a lot of users of rblackpeopletwitter are white and this is supposed to be a joke saying that they usually cant relate to some of the crazier shit bpt post so they just kind of roll with it if im understanding and its safe to assume the user who posted that is also white which is why it would be funny because heshe is posting their confusion but is going to attempt to relate anyways my nigga

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stop it get some help
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn every time i see tyler i want some of them cinnamon waffles he cooked up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes actually banning legal immigrants and refugees not illegal ones he stopped all people from those countries with anything short of a green card from entering the country even though they are already legal and even the green card thing seems to be debatable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of the funnier moment of loiter squad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im genuinely confused by this what do you mean ban illegal immigrants arent they banned already arent they you know illegal hard to take someone seriously when they dont know the definition of words
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not just ban hes trying to ban build a wall stop trades and kick people out of the country thats some serious fuck your shit up racism right there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya musty bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for the people by the people against the people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck is going on this picture what the fuck is going on in this country

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt ban illegal immigrants if it has illegal in the title its probably already banned they banned legal immigrants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao wtf this got upvotes i just realized this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in a country made by illegal immigrants no by conquers and explorers for illegal immigrants refugees doesnt he know what illegal means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sure glad the people on this reddit arent in government and didnt vote might have turned out bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,suck my dick white america
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me and america used to be cool until they tried that snake legal immigration biz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ayo and im still hearing dumbass people saying they need to come in the right way i cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well dayum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the poster is incorrect trump actually banned legal immigrants immigrants and tourists with visas already given to them by the us government from the usa anything short of a green card means the us government wont allow you at all and even if you have a green card its no guarantee youll be allowed in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes literally doing what he said he was going to be doing if you listened to him during his rallies he mentioned this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obama already built quite a large chunk of wall and kicked out million people he actually did that but no protests trump talks about it and people lose their minds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like north korea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the first settlers were people fleeing europe bc of religious persecution
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too bad it did turn out bad lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they did vote they just live in caliny so it didnt matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ever take an american history class europeans pretty much instantly dominated natives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsgfycatcomcarefuldeadlyimperatorangel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck bill oreilly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all things aside the road to citizenship is not easy i have a few friends who first came here on student visas and are still fighting tooth and nail through a sea of confusion paperwork fees and restrictions just to move on to the next visa its incredibly difficult and expensive not to mention how many years it takes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh ok he said he did that makes it alright i guess and we cant criticise it s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people were like those policies are racistbigoted and trump is too and his supporters were like he isnt going to do all thatits out of contextit wont be that racist when implementedcongress wont let him and then hes in office for a week and he does it and its as racist as everyone said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,baseless claim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump has literally changed the definition of criminal so he could deport damn near anyone anyone charged with a crime regardless of conviction criminal anyone they believe may have done something criminal criminal hes taken things much much further than under obama already if you dont think he wont mass deport more than obama you havent been paying attention also there were protests against deportations sit ins to prevent bus loads of immigrants from being deported demands for daca dapa and general immigration reform social media pushing for specific people to be released etc that stuff didnt stop under obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nk keeps them in by force it doesnt let people out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats how i feel when i successfully flip something in a skillet too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo ask them how they feel about illegal immigrants i bet my ass theyre against it ive never seen anything make someone more against illegal immigration than going through the immigration process
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well student visas are nonimmigrant visas theyre only allowed to stay for years after graduation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the point is a lot of liberals and the media assumed he was being hyperbolic that he should be taken seriously but not literally and then oh shit hes literally doing what he said he was gonna do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i actually remember a thread somewhere where people started realizing he wasnt speaking figuratively when he said he was going to build a wall and he was being literal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is it racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no its not its based on government statistics read a fucking newspaper and youd know instead of getting your news from memes just google deporter in chief and youll see what latino leaders think of obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on the flip side my parents came over legally and wouldnt wish that process on anyone i dont know that id call them proopen borders from everywhere but theyre close certainly proopen border with mexico were not mexican but your point is super valid i work with a large immigrant population id say theres few people in the middle most cluster into hard on illegals or proamnesty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i saw that often in td threads on pol and in trump supporter interviews he wasnt being literal and apparently we were silly for thinking he meant what he said oh wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,assumed he was being hyperbolic that he should be taken seriously but not literally wasnt just liberals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do people need to suffer since you did if anything you shouldnt have suffered and neither should they or anyone that wants to come here as far as im concerned if anyone is willing to risk it all and leave home behind for the dream of america then they need to be let in with open arms but thats just my opinion

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,warren beatty was given the wrong envelope when he went to present best picture the envelope he was given was for emma stone as best actress in lala land instead of moonlight as best picture he was obviously confused but just announced lala land the cast and crew came up and started giving speeches before they were notified by the backstage crew that they werent supposed to be there bedlam has ensued
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh how did your friend miss every news outlet worldwide calling this breaking news last night and well into today
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont even joke cause there are people who def take it seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man this sounds like msuniverse all over again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,small detail wasnt warren who announced it he was confused because the card said emma stone la la land and showed it to faye who didnt seem to understand his problem and just announced it

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the harambe post ive been waiting for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this new prehistoric spongebob meme got me laughing at even the most unrelatable shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i was in dubai i needed more ice because the drink i ordered was too shitty they replaced my drink with a coke for free i thought it was pretty cool holy shit this story isnt as interesting as i thought
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sprite is stealth mode for water cups
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,owner creep up on you and slap the cup out of your hand lookin at you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant relate i pay for things that i want
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my ex always did this and it bothered me so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from experience the manager sees you and asks for a receipt you tell him that you threw it away and he tells you youre banned and to never come back then you come back anyway and he never notices because hes always in the back and the people up front dont care anyway im not sure if he actually has the power to ban people but he definitely doesnt do a good job of enforcing it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys this is totally wrong and dishonest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres actually a button under the counter near the register that shuts off the soda machine and only leaves the water on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at my old restaurant my manager always told us to take drinks out of the soda fountain because soda contracts are cheap as shit and wasting the bottles was more expensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why dont you just pay for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,make you pay for it or call the cops cause thats stealing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whenever it was just one person in the store asking for water id always reach around the soda machine and turn it off the water tab still worked but the sodas wouldnt and theyd complain about it being broken
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i worked at panera as cashier let me tell you wemanagers and crew didnt give a crap if you take soda from the drink station i went to seasons of japan and the cashier gave me and my two brothers cup for sodas i had to ask him if he charged us for it he just smiled and shook his head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black people gotta love em
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only get pissed off when the customer thought they were smart and getting away with something dont act like im a dumbass who doesnt know what youre doing i didnt care as long as you realized that i was hooking you up because i dont give a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,buncha angry white men in here it doesnt cost them shit who cares call the police ill dump the entire drink on the floor and leave your problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so im new to this subreddit and i see that spongebob looking guy every few posts wtf is it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best use of this meme ive seen yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drinks all summer long in canada
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at my sort of previous job have a new one waiting for my two weeks to be up we started specifically not giving black people and trashy looking white people water cups because they were of who was stealing soda
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one time i bought one of their smoothies finished it then filled the cup up with sprite some worker had the nerve to call me out on it and told me it was illegal and that i shouldnt be doing that i told them i already did it though took a sip and walked away if im buying a smoothie the size of a capri sun i cant get some sprite but the other guy can buy a large drink for the fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its true no one cares except the owner or managermanager because of inventory if shit disspeapers woth out a money trial the owner gets pissedon that notarent sodas only a dollar at mcds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a huge pet peeve of mine and i dont even work in food
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,catch these hands too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this sub now for dumbass memes is this the new or meirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know this is only at but i fucking died at this i do this shit all the time ive only heard about a friend getting called out on it once
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not really their problem unless they are managers what are they gonna do ban them from the mcdonalds pretty sure they rather keep the business
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is exactly it blazed asf one night with friends at jack in the box one of them ordered a water cup and as hes filling it up with fanta this lady working there comes over and starts refilling cups she doesnt say a thing she just put up those cups and went back to the register
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless the manager sees you they give a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a former employee of the golden arches we really arent whenever some annoying kids came in and asked for water cups i would tell them i dont give a shit what they put in them so long as my managers dont see
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah i usually just subtlety made a comment to scare the person or just look at them while they were stealing soda and they would get a worried look on there face it was kind of funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a guy i know who works at mcdonalds says that if they spot someone stealing soda in a water cup they are supposed to give a disapproving glare no words or real actions employees are told to give only a disapproving glare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude this fucking lady manager at mcdonalds nearby goes apeshit on people i watched her give a black chick a water cup and completely ignore the next customers in line to watch what the girl got the girl put hic or something in the cup and the manager flew over there like a hawk and was all up in the girls shit saying she would pour it out and get water or throw the cup away or she was going to call the cops on her for theft literally screamed out i knew you werent going to get water you people always do this all over what amounted to probably a cent loss for the company
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,worked at taco bell in hs and you are correct managers would act like they just solved a fucking dr house disease when they would see a kid with soda in his water cup all cocky about it then they would bitch at me because i didnt go take it from him why didnt i take it an hour thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,former restaurant managementyou are correct
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it unites us all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is to a broke ass teenager that hasnt gotten a proper ass whooping think youre too good to drink water shiiit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel quite whelmed after reading your tale
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for more like this check out rpointlessstories
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dubai was lit man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,about years ago i was visiting fam in malaysia and my cousins and i went to mcdonalds he tripped on the stairs carrying big mac meals and they gave us new ones free of charge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was interesting to me if that makes you feel any better
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,neat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rpointlessstories
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sneaky motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its pretty fucking classless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like your talking about a specific restaurant may i ask where it is exactly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice try ronald
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahahahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry multibillion fast food that underpays staff for taking a drop of water from your swimming pool of profit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what bottles im confused
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,prolly too busy buying jordans who the fuck can afford a dollar drink
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because you can get it free
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah sure dude totally call the cops over a ¢ beverage and drive customers away for the next hour or so while the cops sort thing out no you just kick them out of the building and move on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i worked at quiznos like years ago id catch people doing this shit all the time i did not give a single fuck not only because i was but because who gives a fuck lol the company basically gets that shit for free
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck outta hea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,call the cops hahahahahaha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahahah i think i did this nearly every day in middle school and nothing happened workers were too busy on their sidekicks to give a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow you sound like a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where did you work i used to work at a tacobell and those drink machines were a bitch to turn on and off it would take like minutes for them to turn back on and start dispensing beverages again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,flavor of the month
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,personally i prefer scooby memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its lit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same here in michigan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still stealing if you are upset about the size of the smoothie for the price dont get the smoothie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,inventory how does that keep track of refills
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it bothers you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao bro do you know how cheap soda is the cup is worth more than the soda lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did this last week how do you feel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saw someone use a water cup to pour his own monster out of a can into manager flipped the fuck out started yelling at him and made him get the can out of the trash to show him still kicked him out threatening to call the cops shit was weird
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ban them from one store theyll go to another if they get banned from all the stores it aint gonna hurt mcdonalds any
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure they rather keep the business rather keep the business of somebody who buys mcdoubles and then steals soda i doubt it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait then why is she a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats really not the point if people steal soda a day for a cent loss a year youre looking at about thrown away however the people that fill their water cups up with soda usually are only buying cheaper priced food you arent making as much money on them and so its worth it to lose their business then you still need to consider how you are making your customers who pay for their drinks feel if you dont stop those who dont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just pay for the soda you cheap ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah fuck her for stopping some piece of shit low life from stealing stop acting entitled you fucking loser
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my manager at the mall wanted me to follow sketchy looking people around the store she got angry when i asked for a definition of sketchy i didnt get paid enough to care about people stealing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damnn only an hour where do you live
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fck is that even legal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just the right amount of whelmed after his story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey i did something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its so rare to see someone whelmed typically over or under
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my homie rocko
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats freaking awesome three big mac meals are a lot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well yea think about it person so poor they need to steal worth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think theyre underpaid for what they do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im presuming bottled versions of the drinks that they also have for sale
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so youd be comfortable with someone taking all of your things from you without paying for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,using that logic why not steal everything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch nothing in this world is free
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this literally happened to some kids while i was at subway the other day guy said give me for the drink or im calling the cops i was checking out and almost just paid for the kids drink myself because the guy behind the counter seemed serious didnt stick around to see how it ended tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit man when i worked fast food it was me who was getting soda with my water cup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah how dare he not let people steal stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds hilarious to me petty on the job revenge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jimmy johns it was just a key operated switch at the side that worked instantly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like douche canoo had buyers remorse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol poor bastards doing ketchup packet inventory
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well shit didnt think of that good point i stand corrected
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,something being cheap is a pretty shitty excuse to steal it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not technically true but thats why they can sell you nuggets for a dollar they make money on other items like soda so just buy it ya crook
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who the fuck portions out monster into a tiny plastic cup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but it was his own drink so that doesnt really apply to this situation i believe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,speaking as someone who has worked in food service the markup on soda is ridiculously high its a mixture of local tap water and some really condensed soda syrup the true cost of a soda is a couple cents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cuz shes a she
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because i payed for a real drink when she didnt even give a shit i shoulda just got a damn water cup i guess im the real bitch in this situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if its such a fucking concern they should give them cups of water instead of a water cup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,definition of sketchy you know the urban looking ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was probably a few years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was several years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is for waiters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvusschoqttyq
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im a tad underwhelmed by his tale
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks to your comment we both got karma d
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thatsthejoke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ahh yes i give so few fucks in life however that i rarely go above or under whelming myself im a neutral whelmer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they dont nobody needs to drink coke instead of water im too poor to pay mcdicks for sugar water i still dont steal it because having class isnt about how much is in your wallet its about knowing how to fucking act
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,try surviving on it noone should have to work hours a week two fast food jobs to pay bills
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it honestly comes down to supply and demand their wages are going to be low because theres a stack of applications in the managers office for people who need work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you are correct
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bro its soda not literally everything you own
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not everything is as easy to steal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well tell you the cops didnt come
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we got as much soda as we wanted for free from the machine like i said the place basically gets that shit for free
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,amen brother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man im jelly we had to flip a switch and it made this god awful whrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr noise for like minutes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought you were insulting him at first but then i saw his username
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk man the whole thing was weird all i wanted way my mcdouble and to get out of there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always like mine cold if its warm i could see maybe why someone would want to put it in a cup with ice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe he just wanted some ice with his monster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do people really want to drink soda that badly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt every liquid we drink besides milk just water and flavoring even most juices
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now ladies dont be mad at me im only callin ya bitches cause i dont know your names individually kat pickin fights with kids williams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tru
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you ordered a drink and she gave it to you what a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that just seems like poor management of business finances
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,keep justifying being a thief proves that you are a low life pathetic trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the ones who make this sub possible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with the urban hair and urban skin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cmon man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trust me i got us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fun fact in mexico bottled coke is cheaper than bottled water which is why mexico is so unhealthy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sometimes though we let pride get in the way of something thats not that much of a big deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre born into your class its about pedigree its about upbringing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but why have both where is this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your argument was you can get it for free not anything to do with what it costs them someone can get all of your stuff for free if they just take it so thats fine with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slippery slope
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so if its easy to steal then you should go ahead and steal it you get how you sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,katt you too old to be believing in evolution williams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont steal but i dont give a fuck if people steal from a company that doesnt give a flying fuck about its employees or customers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt say shitposting middle class white teens
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pride pride in stealing from people nvm i didnt realize what subreddit i was in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya but youre never born dependent on soft drink
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,portability subway has a mini fridge of bottled drinks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wasnt the one who said that and i just think people are overreacting over a soda that costs next to nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not condoning stealing just answering the first commenters question on why would you steal soda when you could just payfor it lmao why does anyone steal anything because they can also for anyone getting super butthurt off soda stealing i used to work at a fast food place and a restaurant and neither place gave a shit about what you put in a water cup the cup is half the size of a soda cup and the concentrated soda mix the restaurant gets makes producing soda dirt cheap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mistake strat was one we used sometimes but even our manager didnt give a fuck about making ourselves a sub literally no one there gave a fuck idk if it was just the wages but i ate there for a living on the free shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah your hardees has some issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe if your managers were more strict about charging people what they are supposed to be paying anyways they could spend some of that excess cash on a back up grease trap and still have enough money to give you a raise for having to put up with it in the meantime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the question is why are you getting so judgy about someone whos just trying to do their job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we arent talking about a company you are defending the thief has nothing to do with which they steal from they are still thieves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stealing worth of soda sounds like some bitch ass micromanagement shit to me give the people what they want brah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shut up bird
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is completely missing the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but dude stealing a half size cup of soda from a fast food place is literally the same thing as stealing pain meds from your dying grandmothers cabinet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she flat out refused to serve the next people in line until she knew what the girl got she yelled at the top of her lungs in the middle of her store about how you people always do this black people water cup people if its such a hassle when someone asks for a water cup give them a cup full of water and be done with it they already waste so much money in food and paper products being thrown straight in the trash whats another cents every now and then ive seen first hand the underhanded tactics fast food places use to save money and honestly dont give a fuck if someone steals oz of soda
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you decide to randomly murder someone but they just happen to be a wanted serial killer should you still be punished yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the cost is irrelevant i can see why people would try to rationalize being a shitty person that way though not surprised to see people here are totally cool with it yet im sure people would be pissed to see someone talk about the stereotype they are based in reality after all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah it was always the gm that cared but no one else did he was usually home by like anyways so after that it was free subs haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so being a good person is not stealing almost free soda k gothcha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre really struggling arent you do i need to use smaller words
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,starting to sound like the guys at riamverysmart right now get off your high horse already bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like i said its not surprising considering the subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,go save soda elsewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuck is with old people and tech its like a vcr but easier jesus christ

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,normal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plan b is not an alternative to birth control do not just use it like its the same thing as a morning after condom it puts a very real strain on a womans body you think putting on a condom is uncomfortable try having your uterus shut down and expel everything to get rid of whatever egg may have been fertilized dont take advice about plan b from bpt its can actually be painful for many women sometimes like going through a periodmiscarriage every comment you see on here about contraception doesnt give a fuck about how it ends up actually affecting the woman as long as they get their latex free nut they dont give a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shits expensive though costs like bucks 😤
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depending on the state yes i believe so b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if its a plan b or an actual pregnancy i think a girl would take a plan b every time

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hi breadnbutterr thanks for submitting to rblackpeopletwitter however your submission has been removed this action was taken because its a text conversation not a social media post if you disagree with this action you can please include a link to your post so that we can see it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this low effort post should be removed from reddit i think i speak for the majority of reddit users when i say that this was not funny whatsoever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,azzzuming
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats okay because some other redditers thought it was funny you arent the entire reddit community
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,relevant username
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was funny real or not funny shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bottom left 😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is basically the but i date year olds starter pack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this mf name is crandon blearywhat else should we expect
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can hear me for you see me i got card board in da trunk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that a fuckin stove
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man can you imagine being lost in one of those cars how low will the volume go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hoopty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf kinda name is crandonim not surprised a crandon does shoddy work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,naaaaah this cant be real life dude is using a home depot bucket as an enclosure smfh you can get a box for like at walmart edit damn how is that cardboard box supporting those speakers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,talk about headpounding bass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never met a crandon in rl but i can damn well assure you if i did i wouldnt let him touch my car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i say lets roll the dice with trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id rather go deaf fuck that prick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well if it is sound anything like the last wutang record i dont think it would be worth it chambers is goat hip hop record though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna need those tracks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so ive been rolling with this idea for a while both candidates are shitty but trump is better because if he gets elected he wont be able to get anything done due to being repulsive to just about everyone if hillary gets elected though she knows all the back channels to go through to get stuff done and will pretty much be up to her sneaky shit as usual just with more power so we need to elect trump solely due to his incompetence as a politician
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so we vote him in and impeach him before he can do any damage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump really would be a dice roll i feel like i know very little about how he feels about nearly everything he views women as objects which is shitty but probably wouldnt translate into actual policy he probably hates mexicans but im not even convinced of that it might be some ploy to have republicans vote for him like his opposition to abortion thats why i wanted him to beat the other republicans because they would be all around awful but he might be ok on somethings just because we really dont know what his opinions are on anything unless hes just an unstable rich manchild with no real opinion on anything which is a real possibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,username checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the goal should be to keep them on a
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you guys never report these comments we try to ban all novelty accounts and it would help if users would report them when they show up

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,snekity swooty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trouser snake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sneaky snek
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boop the snoot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who you think you fooling with that line big
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we dont even need a dna test for this one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,khaled is legit muslim asahds necklace says allah but id never heard of of khaled being a muslim guess its true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was hoping it would be liooooon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were going to find out asahd was running this and khaled is just there to transport
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha they look so similar its kinda adorable for all the shit that dj khaled gets this makes me happy for him but i guess what the kid was actually saying is dddont let this man distract you from the fact that in the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell and plummeted ft through an announcers table
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats my boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wwwe the best
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not much of a hiphop fan so i dont know his music but dj khaled is all about motivating his fans and being a good father i have to respect him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,am i the only one thinking how close the letters in asahds name are to each other on a keyboard thats a name id choose for a character by mashing the keyboard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his first words will be emojis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly dont even know what dj khaled actually does besides saying major key and you own this summer and shouting out his own name and stuff like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,adorable i mean khaled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,billy voice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,son remember them hot wheels is always fast you gotta rip the wheels off pull the axles off and then put the axles in the fuckboys hands
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sheds a single tear thats my boy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why he look like a nat geo kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hate the gy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why does asahd have a god necklace
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did he really have to put the allah pendant around the childs neck its a baby for goodness sake it doesnt even understand what any of this is supposed to mean i guess khaled is another one of these idiots who think islam is somehow the religion of black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looks just like a mini khaled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is he khaled married how is this man so successful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk exactly where but he has middle eastern ancestry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,before is dj name was arab attack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his name is khaled mohammed khaled i think hes jewish probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his original dj name was dj arab attack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i totally thought he was persian i feel racist now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or keys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,asahd actually does mean liooooon in arabic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he thiccc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,baby fat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chunkiness is a major 🔑
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here i was thinking he just loves carne asada
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes out of billion people you are the only one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes a behind the scenes powerhouse a lot of popular collabsremixes wouldnt exist without him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow youre actually an idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im gonna have to say that this is actually his son do you see that smirk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes non stop hustle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes actually a pretty good producer and hes really great at marketing himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,khaled has admitted to being muslim on multiple occasions but isnt a practicing muslim he never really praises anyone except the most high but during his wifes pregnancy he played the athan call to prayer for his son indicating that he still holds onto his faith
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think dj khaled has a better ring to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,persians can be and often are muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never mind then just asaaahd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill be honest ive never before heard of that dish it doesnt sound bad tho i think i might give it a shot sometime though e im slightly intoxicated and cant write
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude cant someone on the internet agree for once instead of bein a dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because its a baby you think that baby has read the quran and agrees with its claims and commandments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not here to become popular but you could at least add a form of argument to your insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i bet he was born with the chain too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,married to success 🙏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes actually a pretty good producer except that he aint he only gets artists to collaborate with each other he doesnt do beats on the regular afaik
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,admitted to being muslim thats a weird way of saying that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure he was also playing it to asahd yesterday on snapchat might be the day before too not too sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,low key probably one the best decisions he ever made was changing his name to dj khaled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a bot lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre acting like its a bad thing his son is wearing an allah necklace when its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we da besss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cant be an open muslim in trumps america
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he pled guilty to islam america in two or three more years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then the dude who made the bot is an even bigger dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so the mere notion of not being enthusiastic for islam or opposing the use of little children to advertise religion is beyond you btw that baby is wearing anything you put on it if i put a che tshirt on that baby would that make it a communist if i laid it on a copy of atlas shrugged would that make it an objectivist baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true well end up deported to mexico
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his son is muslim so there is nothing wrong with putting an allah necklace on him hes not advertising the religion and i really cant be bothered to argue with you either i have better things to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so if i put a che tshirt on my baby it becomes a communist you are fucking sick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a i said i wouldnt reply but you completely misunderstood my point b calm the fuck down when a child is born to religous parents the child tends to get raised believing in a religion this is completely different from putting a shirt on a child for a political agenda i dont think there is anything inherently wrong with raising a child to believe in a religion as long as the parent allows the child to change their mind when they are able to form rational thoughts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and my child is likely to become a communist when i raise it that way so what at the very least the baby is not a muslim yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so what at the very least the baby is not a muslim yet yes he is as i said a childs religion is of the time the same as their parents a kid born to christian parents will be christian its the same for every religion when he gets older he may choose to follow another religion or to abandon religion completely but as a baby he is by default whatever religion his parents are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the chocolate i eat now will soon be shit does that mean its already shit your problem seems to be with the concept of time itself do you call a child of communist parents a communist yes or no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,once again you are confusing politcal views with religion and i really dont know why a religion is a lifestyle political views are not im turning off notifications now speaking to you is like speaking to a brick wall
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats both a poor excuse and it doesnt do anything the baby doesnt have the lifestyle of a muslim any more than it has the political views of one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he hates all things brown
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lickitung a freak need me one like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saying gang gang in a tweet is just fucking cringeworthy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this whole time i didnt realize lickitung was gen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,breakfast of champions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your order was probably just muffled due to your sisters tit in your mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok where is this coming from when was it made known he doesnt eat ass which is pretty fuckin gross anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh you saved that title
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,redemption
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he hates them so much hes gonna give them manufacturing jobs just so he doesnt see your dark skin selling for at wendys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if this is a joke its a good one if not gtfo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that gross if she showered before tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude my wife loves itand i like doing it if they shower beforehandwhats the deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that seems very specific
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh its so one sided here people will believe whats convenient for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ass has no taste compared to vagina in my opinion anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even better unshowered tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the big deal if i think its fuckin nasty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my order was very specific and your dark skinned ass gave me the wrong sauce
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the other side
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the opposition
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just thought you had a dissenting opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what does this even mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when your sociology professor talks about race specifically pertaining to black people and youre the only one in the class
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont hate on me cuz i eat good

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes i have an excellent ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well that could be a reason

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree with you completely prejudice against other people is a sign of ignorance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big baby was just a weirdo altogether
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i remember correctly he drained a footer and this was his celebration instead of roaring he went full lizard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone put all three together the other day it was awesome catshaqseizure hillary

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all my gay friends say black guys usually have nice thick booties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,omg a reply from chauncii dies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,means gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its only hypergay if you eat it out afterwards
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i noticed a lack of superman in the trailer that might help the movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but trailers are their issues zack synder only knows how to shoot a min trailer montages and call it a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nogustin is just not remotely close to the level of acting for a movie like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no because youre doing what you want and not letting people boss you around if you dont wanna smoke dont if you dont wanna watch some movies dont your life is yours yes because ball is life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basketball is my favorite sport i like the way they dribble up and down the court also i started playing basketball after my senior year of highschool now i play like every other day never too late to start
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you guys think less of me because of this fuck no man you know how much a pro cheerleader can make probably more than what your parents do go do gymnastics you know how much of an asset a man can be for teaching the sport to children kids will feel a lot safer with you catching them than that little nothing white girl who weights you do you man but listen dont let your past experiences hold you back from picking that basketball up again organised sports are really fun and thats what you do just have fun doing something new at the same time grab a ribbon and fuckin twirl that shit bud maybe well see you on tv in years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah just get high the first chance you get its pretty great
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think more of you now tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we think more of you now you are the embodiment of bpt

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i believe this is where it came from httpiimgurcombrznddmjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah ive never seen a pngp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im guessing its a step up from png png seemed to be fine in my opinion but what do i know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,girls frequently tell me i have bigger asses than they do but hey some gay boys have thin booties 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its twue
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its only infinitely gay if he goes home without saying anything to think you dont hear from him for nearly two weeks and he asks you on a date and you agree to go with him and he asks you to be his boyfriend and you say yes its only made more so gay if you continue being his boyfriend and one day he asks for your hand in marriage after a few years of living together its just plain gay if you accept his proposal and listen to your heart ❤️
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree that ones way beyond me maybe might try it its classified
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well thats neat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i appreciate that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont make shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cheerleaders get paid shit by the way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have the opportunity just about every day im just a bit nervous about that stuff going into my lungs and passing the blunt around
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,awwww 😘
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but theres so much stuff you gotta do to do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont hate da playa
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,make america meta again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not actually the moment that led up to it if youll notice in the gif he played for the celtics and in the video he played for the clippers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah id say it was great great
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt say anything about his contributions just what ive noticed since his days in baton rouge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt he retired now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats some high quality gif ya got there bud

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ouch someones sore looks like he hit a nerve there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i put my hand upon your hip when i dip you dip we dip you put your hand upon my hip when you dip i dip we dip i put my hand upon your hip when i dip you dip we dip you put yours and i put mine and we can get down low and roll it round
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably even more confusion due to the wording of my last comment the picture was not the downvote the deleted comment was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt know that i needed this in my life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit thank you so much for this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its beautiful i wanna smack its ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that subreddit is gold

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pvpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually it goes deeper than that i cant find the source right now but it comes from this talk show where this fat acceptance person is talking with a personal trainer in the audience

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in a manner of speaking yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alright now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just want it to grow lol rarely new fire gets posted on there so much potential tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomjzegiqqjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it probably jiggles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black people trading card game probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dupt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here you go httpiimgurcommurwzhqpng theres also a something minute episode on this but fuck watching that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit ladies and gentlemen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the person who makes those comics makes one every new year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the progression from bewilderment to blind rage is remarkable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,risky click
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im officially gay too ☺️
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh i dont believe beginners should start with ediblespotency and all that vapor hot boxing with someone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cough my lungs out man idk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yyes sir 😳 i dont know what a suicide is but 👏🏾sir👏🏾yes👏🏾sir
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you blind or somethin its fire not an arrow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember seeing him cohosting a show on the sec network back in the spring
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah or black people twitter card game whatever you like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that thousand yard stare of restraint while his aorta implodes from the stress
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love the dom mazzetti bro science reference in there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre actually interested in being enraged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the whole episode is actually great if you want to laugh andor cringe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can kinda see how our society pressures people yo be healthy as if its the only way one should be allowed to be but i dont see how this idea suddenly becomes and so thats why being fat is actually healthy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is really hilarious do you have a link to the full episode or even just what the show is called edit nm its posted further down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anybody else find it kinda funny that its in australia and not the us kinda kicks the whole americans are the fat lazy ones argument to the curb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive been wondering if i was since i was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good point my first few times were intense its difficult to gauge doses as a beginner
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a lot easier from a bong or a vaporizer but i mean if you dont wanna do it you dont wanna do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont listen to that guy man yeah tree is great and all but if you dont wanna smoke then thats your decision and a real stoner wont pressure you into smoking if you dont want to just do you man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ask umglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got you covered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mobile though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im on mobile as well whats the downvote button
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think her aorta is in more trouble
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was like a trainwreck i couldnt stop watching
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so many problem glasses and problem bangs cropped too short
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fact that the fat people will make any excuse to be fat shows they are either too stupid to understand theyre effectively killing themselves or they genuinely dont care and i dont know which is worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some of those obese women probably just googled obese person longest lifespan got result of an old obese person and said oh well that means not all fat people are unhealthy so i can be fat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dear lord
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or jump out of a window on the story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the pressure is bad when its so intense and malevolent that it drives people to stress eat even morethe people that do that shit dont actually care if they get better or not tho they just like being dicks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had an inkling since i was when i wanted to know what it was like to kiss a boy ive never had a boyfriend but i sucked dick on august and the guy let me kiss him we made out but it was our first time we couldnt fuck cause his dick was too girthy but hey— at least i knew i was legit gay have you experimented

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,either we can make a hit record or we can not make a hit record back up nuh man you too close
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must be new here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,try handwriting your notes and then typing them up and annotating them the next day on your computer and do this after every class not a week before the exam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,study min to hour every day regardless of whether or not you have class that includes weekends week cramming does not work unless the class is easy or youre really smart and know what to memorize
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre too close man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this the guy who says nothing but dirty stuff right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea thats the worst way to waste time all the information is in the book why rewrite it just sit down and stare at that material summarize paragraphs out loud talk to your tv at the end of chapters or sections maybe then do a typed summary those people in your class making as arent making note cards or writing stuff down theyre sitting there memorizing you have to trust your brain to learn writing stuff down is kinda like stringing a net because you dont think youll remember
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how you gon choke a legend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not op but it just helps having to put the material in your own words its impossible to explain shit you dont understand and idk about you but sometimes i remember actually writing shit down sometimes when i read it gets too long and tedious or there is fluff so its good to comb through the material and condense thats just me though you do you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can tell a man made this you dont wear a lapel pin on a dress
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most likely a year old from the donald subreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if this was true nyc would be the birthplace of la revolución
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a conspiracy by all the shoe stores that you can never find timbs on sale
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how much do timbs typically run are the ones people wear for style steel toe yeah i know that sounds like a cliche redneck question why buy work boots if ya aint gon get em dirty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it just takes a spark to cause change
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deadass revolution b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not a conspiracy the corny ones go on sale buttas stay retail because they always sell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually this is a pretty solid conspiracy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,go to china and you can buy timps for like off of timbs prices
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ehyo my man come up off that b word is bond you dont drop that shit now ima snuff you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,summer sales sometimes on a related note inch cost now ffs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they go up every year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they forgot the pollen index
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if anyone cares bloomfield hills is a super rich town in michigan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anybody else start reading the header like kevin hart one bed one pillow aint nobody write me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what you need to do is slightly increase the font of all of your periods completely unnoticeable and significantly increases your paper length
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,words is usually a lot shorter than pages
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,change the size of full stops and commas two sizes up from your body text
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oakland county what up doe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pro tip use find and replace to make your papers longer more effective in high school where page count matters more than word count controlh i think itll be under edit then replace all your periods with periods go into advanced and change the font size of the periods youre replacing you can rinse and repeat with other punctuation but its a bit more obvious on other kinds of punctuation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,🙌🏽bloomfield hills🙌🏽
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game weak
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a former ta this seems about right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it would probably help if you didnt single space the heading for no reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if it is a printed paper you can increase the space between letters by in word
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you cant make a womans studies paper over words youve got real issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ayyy for bloomfield hills
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,highlight all the periods commas punctuation etc and make them size make that page paper into a page paper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,double space that heading fam youll add two pages
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was pages long its just that he burned pages of the essay with the fire of his mixtape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,heres what you do when you put space in between paragraphs type out words and make them white ups your word count by however much you want
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i generally have the opposite problem i dont know when to shut the hell up so i actually lose marks for running on too long
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,womens studies lets sort by controversial edit nevermind that wasnt as fun as i thought itd be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not doublespacing those lines amateur
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol womens studies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im wondering why she chose to write her essay in google docs instead of microsoft office like the rest of the world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the actual title open shut case johnson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its where the rich white kids are from when they say theyre from detroit see also birmingham and novi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would if thats where this took place this is bloomield mi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too bad he spelled it wrong lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,live there am not rich fuck birmingham kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt even realize thats what i was doin till u pointed it out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope this trick was played out by the time i was in grade every college professor ive ever had to write a paper has warned about not doing this dumbass shit because they all know about it and its easily noticeable when you submit an assignment online dont do this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no it isnt its clearly double spaced so thats words a page he was over about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats short asf too wait until graduate school hell even senior year of undergrad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,change the margins by of an inch and make a sentence just long enough so that the last line of the paragraph is one word
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ima start calling it full stop now that sounds badass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kinda pointless if theres a word count tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck you and your bentley
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i used to stay in southfield that aint the suburb dummy thats west bloomfield
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry not sorry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,redditor misogynistic figures
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,game changer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it says shes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre in high school
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,google docs is mad convenient you can edit your work from where ever you have a connection and send someone a link so that they can edit it too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all changes saved to drive now thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you have a lot to learn ive been writing everything on google docs since it became a thing its saved automatically and accessible everywhere not bloated with unnecessary features you dont need to write a simple essay you can invite other people to collaborate if its a group project
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,google drive is free exports to every major format does everything most people would need to do in word saves every change constantly is in the cloud so your documents are accessible and shareable within an instant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well my school gave us all google accounts so it was simpler not to mention google saves every letter which is really helpful in case the laptop dies or restarts or on a desktop when the power goes out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always use google drive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sprinkle some crack on him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,farmington northville livonia etc mile isnt as hood as you think even people here in michigan dont believe me when i say i live on mile no way the eminem movie street zomg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must be massively increasing increasing your periods or over using it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know what youre saying here im a year old junior in an undergrad program
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure i wrote every paper in high school with the line spacing set to instead of double spacing way less noticeable when its printed out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why unis can deem papers formally inappropriate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean that is the proper term for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have you ever written a paper for school
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf happened here lol fill us in mane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same with onedrive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also it auto saves and keeps all past revisions so you can literally never losr your work thats a fucking godsend after ive lost a few essays to random computer shitstorms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel u homeboy is a dumbass just wanted to tell u that the friend zone is not real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,live in bloomfield hills went to seaholm can confirm i know peoples parents whove lived here all their lives that never been to detroit thinking they will instantly get shot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds about right haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do you increase it on all periods without going one by one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no i havent used it at all in probably three years is it really that hard to believe that college level professors with strict expectations on their papers have heard of this high school bs and check for it and he end of the day if youre gonna be lazy do what you want but when you finally leave hs and try this in big boy school youre gonna be in for a pretty rude awakening
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so was i i finished college late
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in sports management or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so is period one is used more in the us and the other more in uk im just saying i want to use the other from now on thats all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hate when this type shit happens like skipping an episode of atlanta
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes good sir le superior stem is the only thing worth learning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,find replace all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you have to go one by one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i already attend the university of washington have been for a while but i use it on occasion the fact is tas mostly read our papers and they might read a hundred papers in a short amount of time if they ask you for a printed paper its impossible to notice a font period over font words online its a bit more tricky and more of a risk and should be used with caution if its a large class with people its a safe bet but when were talking about smaller english classes its a bigger risk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no in the history and anthropology of nutrition is what youre saying that a five page paper is short i agree with you that its not that productive of a length for a significant paper like a research paper or a final but thats not what im talking about you seem pretty intent on bragging about the superior quality of your education good luck with that also just noticed this paper specifies its for a high school class
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont play me like that man lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcompkhgbdcjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uber snitchin everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im routoftheloop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont ever trust a dude with a chinstrap beard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uber drivers gettin that pink lyft mustache real quick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,three different pictures damn hes snitchin on eerybody
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but disney supports him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,snitching aint always bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,top right he pointin with his other hand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes not supporting trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,calling niggas out like the umpire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shoulda been the title
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomlboxhptjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this nigga snitchin my dude cant keep his lips sealed for shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo those are some strong backers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no wonder i saw so many facebook posts saying fuck uber use lyft
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxhckiwspng
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pepsi though 😥😥😥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow elon musk too what about climate change too bad i cant afford a tesla cuz id boycott that shit for real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the only good guy there is elon musk niggas a real life tony stark
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is not snitching trump announced this himself iirc back in december
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know what they say though snitches get bitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre not necessarily backers theyre members of an economic advisory panel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a chance for them to lobby directly to trump and influence economic policy for their gain extremely easily if given the chance to serve on his economic panel i sure as shit would
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not only cause of that when taxi drivers stopped picking up from jfk lyft followed suit but uber drivers kept picking up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no reason before to use uber over lyft its noticeable cheaper and all my lyft drivers have told me they get paid more with lyft then when they drove for uber everybody wins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck pepsi just drink coke or if you got good taste hit that rc cola 🙏🏼
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we can pretend that can be your excuse for not owning one now like nah i couldve got a tesla but hes working with trump so i got this corolla instead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can see the logic behind it even if you disagree with it if offered the chance to be on an advisory board to the president even if you have severe reservations about him do you just turn that down what if you have more ability to push your agenda from the inside than the outside i think of it as trying to do damage control and it made sense up until now its become clear however that trump doesnt want any actual advice some might say it was clear earlier but the firings have made it impossible to ignore and the only thing to do now is to quit and distance yourself as much as possible from the trump administration
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i dont get how this snitchin when it wasnt a secret lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not how it goes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was snitches be bitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aka directly lobbibility to the president
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean i fucking hate the guy too but he runs a multibillion dollar international business i dont think its really fair to say that hes financially illiterate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not seeing anything about lyft stopping people from picking up at jfk they did donate million to the aclu though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i really think that dude is catching a bad rap on this i understand that were all supposed to fall into lockstep with the protests and make no mistake i support the protesting but for an owner to just be like nah fuck yall we aint working today based on his own beliefs is kind of fucked up really people are also giving him shit for removing surge pricing during the protest to take advantage of the situation but he said in a statement and is actually verifiably true that they generally do that for emergency situations and the like whether you believe his reasoning or not is whatever but it is a thing that they normally do and ive said this a couple times today but a guy with reasonable hopefully morals or at least intelligence being on that council is a lot better than him getting replaced with another bannon or devos some shit its like saying man fuck oskar schindler he shoulda just gave hitler the finger and bounced i know it looks like i work for uber i swear i dont im just starting to get alarmed at how quick we are to throw people under the bus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lyft actually kept picking people up as well they just didnt announce it like uber did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the dumbest fucking protest ive ever heard of inconveniencing everyday travelers isnt going to do your cause any favors edit should have remembered that this is the same group who supported people blocking highways to spread the word about their cause alright bring it on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then why try to keep it secret why they calling the uber guy a snitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sure if not im fucked because i snitch all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,snitches get riches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with the money he was given you can pay people to be financially literate for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe not illiterate but by no means is he any good at it everything he touches ends up bankrupt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats fair hes just regular illiterate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not stopping work completely just not picking up from jfk it looked bad especially since this protest is about something huge lyft nailed it with their response whoever works pr for them should be promoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people are also giving him shit for removing surge pricing during the protest to take advantage of the situation holy shit they cant win people are complaining that surge pricing was disabled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit that schindler analogy made me burst in tears
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see where youre coming from but to me stopping work on a historic day is a key step in getting people to notice protesting isnt something to casually glance over and make facebook posts about its at the point of having to yell in your face right now is the too late we were talking about when we were protesting against cheeto benito before its too late
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dumber than protesting starbucks by buying starbucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not quite getting what you mean what was secret this advisory board was never secret it was announced months ago theyre calling him a snitch because he name dropped other people on the board when he was called out by employees for being part of it honestly guy didnt really do anything wrong in this instance you want to complain about his actions as the head of uber there are way bigger things to object to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga if that was true hed be broke goofy ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i totally hear that but thats my other beef people are acting like lyft gives a fuck about them to me its no different than people who say yeah but trumps one of the good billionaires hes on our side neither company really gives a shit in the end and even if its to save face uber is giving triple what lyft is though im glad that people are getting involved with politics finally were not exactly distancing ourselves from the wild sports team shit that we keep admonishing the opposition for and that shit snowballs hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lyft only gives a fuck about cash and so does uber if an emergency situation arose with uber theyd get a bad rap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for a lot of uber drivers airport travelers is a huge part of their business if you bar them from doing airport business you are in effect barring them from working
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably the drivers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that cant have been a thing lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he was broke lost all the millions he inherited at one point watched a documentary on him and youd be surprised how much of his success he owes to other people especially the guy that coauthored his book
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,billions is a number he says it hasnt been proven you know what would prove it tax returns also if he had just let his money sit in a trust and did nothing but live that super rich neet lifestyle hed have more money now than he claims to have hes not good at business just suckering idiots who dont know how rich people actually live
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uber has been caught doing some shady shit in their business though lyft may not be angels but they arent uber
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know about that if theyre complaining that surge pricing was disabled to take advantage of the situation it sounds like people are mad that disabling surge pricing was done as a marketing ploy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is most definitely worth at least a few billion his properties are public hes worth billion on the low end
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as i understand it the reason people are upset that they disabled surge pricing was because it was incentivizing people to use uber specifically during a time where the taxis said they werent going to drive so it was kind of a fuck you to the protest and also to their competition
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seems like it was ten or so idiots who came up with the idea and a whole fuck load of people making fun of them still what a bunch of morans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats kind of an odd criticism that those people are making if your competition are on strike then theyre removing themselves temporarily from the market for transport uber doesnt need to incentivize people to hire their drivers by lowering price because people now have no other option or many fewer options if they want to hire a driver but i guess i can kind of see how some people can tumble through the mental gymnastics to think thats a fuck you nonetheless they could have kept surge pricing then they would have been seen both as scabs and as exploitative nowin unless uber management wants to force their employees not to work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,morans 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you think that people didnt get it because of how elaborate it was or because of how shitty it was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i knew this fat ass nigga back in the day who would order pizza and couldnt wait the min so he told them hed meet the delivery nigga half way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that must of been a sobering ph response surprised he could actually type straight and seemingly clear minded in his first post evidence that weed makes you smarter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saw this a few years ago on twitter with dominos
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cheese mustve gotten stuck on the box rip that dudes pizza
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just for his honesty he deserves a free pizza
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all this is is a person not trying to get someone fired so good on him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no joke i would just make my own pizza in that time hell there is yeast for pizza dough now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was high ass fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gime piza
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,minutes for a pizza delivery is actually too long tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as far as pizza places go its probably the best one in my opinion large choice of toppings crust toppings sauces its bomb when your faded and even when youre not pizza hut is the shit 💯 edit not sure why im being down voted im not some ph rep the shit is just good lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree isnt th rule usually min or more and you get the order free or at least a good discount
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love pizza hut they have good prices they have this big hersheys cookie that is amazing too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im the only person i know that loves pizza hut when were chilling and getting pizza im always saying pizza hut but getting shut down pizza hut is the shit those fucking little cheese triangles that are in breadcrumbs fuck me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i looked at the stars
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not sure why im being down voted probably because youre saying pizza hut is the best pizza place when anyone who has ever eaten pizza knows thats not the case
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they stopped that in the delivery drivers kept crashing and running red lights and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this aint spiderman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,way better than dominos and cheaper at least in the uk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats your favorite pizza place then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao but seriously while that might not be in effect minutes is still a lot of time to wait for a pie every second after i order from a pizza place i cant wait for it to come and it usually takes mins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah exactly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a chain called franco manca in the uk their pizzas look like this and car cheaper than dominospoppa johns etc basically anywhere where they actually give a shit about the ingredients and use a wood fire oven or even a crap oven with good ingredients
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna have to disagree here in the pizza place i used to deliver for they couldnt go from order to pizza being ready to go in less than minutes meaning i wasnt on my way until minutes after the order was placed at the earliest and the traffic in the city it honestly took about minutes from the time the order was placed until i got there most of the time sometimes it legitimately took over an hour but the pie was fresh when it got there perfection takes time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive been trying lately to stop getting delivery all the fast food places make you pay a delivery fee and then youve got to cover tip its faster and cheaper for me to just walk in and grab a pizza which really sucks because i like sitting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can understand that but in a suburb i found it usually pretty quick maybe i was wrong with the minute mark but it wasnt that far off edit sorry minute matk i was way off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bunch of mediocre people are gonna downvote the shit out of this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont get it mane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or we could just not put race on the application and go entirely on merit what a concept
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its designed to help any group of people systematically disadvantaged within a particular social context in some contexts asians may not be disadvantaged and in others they may appear not to be as such
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do the black people tweeting this meme not understand that their grades are worse i mean thats why affirmative action exists in the first place its like watching a guy in a wheelchair making fun of someone for having a limp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from salon fishers case before the supreme court in which she demanded that she be admitted to the university of texas at austin despite not having the grades to get in confirmed every liberal suspicion about the opposition to affirmative action namely that its not about equality at all but about making sure white people are always first in line ahead of all people of color for job and education opportunities that her lawyer edward blum has made a career out of creative litigation designed to keep people of color from getting jobs schooling and even political representation simply confirms it further the invocation of intangible qualities is especially critical in this case which addresses a small number of slots the school offered for provisional admission in these are students that are admitted even though they dont have the grades or sat scores that you usually need to get into the school the school brings these students in anyway because they see potential for them despite their mediocre scores fisher sees herself as one of those people but the school did not in such students were admitted who had lower grades or test scores than fisher fortytwo of them were white only five were people of color
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you missed the entire point of this huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why does it matter if theyre disadvantaged it shouldnt be harder for an asian kid to get in despite higher scores and grades because the minority is overrepresented
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one is a question of systemic disadvantages that manifest themselves through large and small factors that compound through history and the other is someone with meritorious shortcomings even within a system that is advantageous to her and blaming others as the culprits for her not achieving her goals the irony is she suspected that the school choose minorities over her but actually even under her ideal conditions she wouldnt have been accepted the university affirmative actions systems are not confined to only countries with historical race imbalances since even the chinese have a similar system to help those from smaller asian ethnic groups or those from economically disadvantaged regions in china even country as homogenous as china recognizes that there are other factors at play other than race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do the black people tweeting this meme not understand that their grades are worse are u implying that all black people have bad grades and can only get in college because of affirmative action thats not a racist opinion at all s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you make assumptions that their grades are worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,amazing bait you seemed to get a big haul off of it really hope im right and youre not just mentally disabled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this bitch is dumb their whole argument is dumb but for the love of god dont ever use salon as a source they are pure shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt affirmative action good for black and hispanic people as well as white people i thought it was only detrimental to asianindians
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no because based on scores her dumb ass wouldnt have gotten in regardless of her race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you could write a whole doctoral dissertation on the merits of affirmative action and it wouldnt make these people any less hypocritical
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if their grades were not worse they would not need affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i opened the link read the title and got the feeling i was in for some foxnews level sensationalist garbage but yeah fuck this case though just tired of shitty internet journalism nowadays
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that bitch look like jenny and forrest had a daughter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i suppose it would be detrimental to whoever is in the majority
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wellyes and no it has helped racial minorities receive jobs they are qualified for amd educationbut it hasnt altered the wage gap between the races or so i read affirmative action works best for white women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean thats what the school argued and she sued them for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she was top in her class and had just below the median sat score she wasnt dumb i need to say this because there is a lot of misinformation about this case the school took people with lower scores than her funny enough texas has a law that if youre in the top of your school any university that you apply to must accept you this is to allow people from underprivileged counties get into college despite not having the same resources as the richer schools she was just juvenile as fuck she graduated from lmu i think a few years ago but this shit pretty much made her look dumb affirmative action statistically helps white women more than any other demographic which is really ironic to say the least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but theyre not the whole point is that a lot of the people tweeting it are saying they would be able to get into schools even without theyre race she had worse grades than the students who got in so even without affirmative action she still would have been worse off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you want to get angry about affirmative action when this case has almost nothing to do with affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the people retweeting this dont even mention affirmative action this girl thought she deserved preference over people because of her race and she got told shut up your grades just suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well if there is a perception that your minority gets better grades than asians could potentially be held to a higher standard than say a white student
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really jews asians and indians always suffered because of aa whites have made out okay especially white women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the whole point is that a lot of the people tweeting it are saying they would be able to get into schools even without theyre race so theyre defending affirmative action while stating there is no need for affirmative action that makes even less sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this case is literally entirely about affirmative action
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not true at all but i can see why you think that affirmative action is there to help those of us who have the grades and the test scores but systemic biases put us at a disadvantage only five people admitted to ut in who had lower test scores than beckywiththebadgrades were people of color fortytwo of them were white so this whole black people have worse grades so they need affirmative action to get into a school they dont deserve to be in is false in fact affirmative action benefits white women the most so becky was getting a leg up and still couldnt get in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre not saying there is no need for it theyre saying that they could do well without it but its still a nice bonus that is deserved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but they cant do well without it thats why it exists in the first place specifically because black people get worse grades and need the scales heavily tipped in their favor to get into college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black people get worse grades youre racist we get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not true but honestly this conversation isnt really worth getting into a heated discussion over you have your opinion and i have mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this might be a little tmi but is this really a bad thing my boyfriend is all ok ok ok ok and im like but its still hard 😂 like i understand sensitivity and stuff but idk i see so many memes about it as if its bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha this is the highlight of head for me ill stay down there until hes prying me off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope its the best thing dont ever let anyone tell you anything otherwise i think some women get off on the fact that when we lose control at that moment we turn into silly puddy in your hands yall continue and we sit there making faces and sounds losing our motor skills and going into anaphylactic shock shit feel good as a muthafucka tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its just really sensitive like super sensitive kinda like when your man mashing that clit and youre telling him to ease up cuz its too much haha but foreal tho maybe a little after to clean up the juices but thats about it 😅
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it usually makes you want to pee so you might as well stop unless you want him pissing in your mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i keep it in my mouth for another few moments but just move really slowly so its not sensory overwhelm this seems to go over pretty well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol heyy big head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uhmm ok theres something wrong with one of us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you might as well stop unless you want him pissing in your mouth httpiimgurcomslqxzwajpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you wild as shit so wyd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its national shoot your shot day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,weakest title i have ever seen and ever will see
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that title was shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this always confused me less regulation for businesses more regulation for personal issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that fetus needs to be born but ill need to be on welfare no welfarelazy ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the social platform of the republican party is impossible to reconcile with the fiscal conservatism that was once the foundation of the party the problem is that most religious fundamentalists dont care they either misunderstand conservatism or dont mind having separate value systems for society and economics appealing to religious fundamentalists was an easy way to get votes and keep the red states locked now its going to be the undoing of the party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why libertarianism is a thing too bad they completely shot themselves in the feet this election cycle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uhhh thats different ok those are all immoral and against the bible you would ban abortion too if only you realized the silent liberal genocide against babies in this country 😡😡
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets be real here the black community isnt a fan of homosexuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,let me kill my child damnit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,womens rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont forget the war on drugs throwing addicts casual users even light marijuana smokers in jail for their own good make it so they cant vote when they get out so their crazy drugged out brains cant keep us from getting reelected
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hate how political this meme is becoming
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you republicans want to make the government small just small enough to fit into the bedroom josh lyman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is this meme called
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least trump can tell the difference between a csection and an abortion oh wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is something ill never understand im technically a republican but damn why does the party have to be so religious abortions should be between the person that wants one their partner if involved their doctor and their faith if involved what people do in their bedroom should be private and women should be equal why are the politicians so against this idk it just doesnt make sense to me they want smaller government but also to manage the lives of the people edit well this blew up a bit im far too drunk to carry on this conversation im just trying to watch football up votes for everyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,republicans we need more defense spending but less spending to help the poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo whats this meme called
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea that too government shouldnt be involved with personal choices if religious people dont want abortions then dont get them its not that fucking hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,typically their fallback is that it should be statedecided that way they can just correct less federal legislation knowing full well that their backwoods ass country bumpkin state will ban abortions and gay marriage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well the logic is that abortion is murder which is illegal you can disagree with that but its not a hypocritical stance because the government and the bible already say that murder is not allowed cutting back on gov regulation doesnt mean that murder would be allowed no reasonable person thinks that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of those things are not like the other
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be honest what republicans are really against is the goverment paying for those things
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree but womens rights dont women have the same rights as men
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this sub has gone completely political
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when you group all conservatives into one group and then get mad when they do the same to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh thanks youngadolf for your input on this matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they would have to do more regulation as theyd have to step in to prevent all the discrimination and such less means less of course its different if they actively try to get government bigger just to be an asshole and take those rights away more which doesnt seem to really be the case minus a few stupid states
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the republicans are against womens rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if only there were a third party that was more consistent about this 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets not forget about marijuana legalization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also immigration religious freedom drug and alcohol prohibition really what they want is for you to be free to be a straight white christian man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is the governments job to protect the rights of others abortion is infringement on a fetuses right to life almost no republicans are against womens rights gay marriage is a different thing i personally support it because again its not the governments job to tell people who to marry it is true though that many republicans think it is wrong and want it banned which doesnt make sense to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,republican here fuck regulated morality and fuck social conservatives do whatever you like assuming it does not infringe upon the lives of others the republican party needs to get its head out of its ass and people need to give less of a shit about what others choose to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont forget weed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its just that logically you dont believe in your side
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who is this man and why is he is so famous in this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plops thats not true as a whole republicans are very against any regulation religious republicans are against things that are against their religious beliefs im a bit more progressive i believe the government needs to get out of peoples lives period should not force people to have to accept anothers religioussexual beliefs i should not needs to bake you a cake if your beliefs are against mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need an oxford comma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,many republicans like ted cruz believe gay marriage should be left to the states anything the constitution doesnt talk about is left to the state
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is this meme called im still confused on what it means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a substantial portion of the republican party is socially moderate or liberal on issues such as abortion gay marriage and women in the workplace republican insistence on social conservatism is why many conservativeish folk arent republican and why independents lean more republican on the opposite side when i was a kid i was confused as to why liberals supported gun control they support liberty the dowhatyouwant attitude when it comes to abortion and gay marriage but want to restrict gun access in my ap gov class we learned that democrats want less regulation of social issues and more government on economic issues republicans want less regulation in the economy and want more government on social issues those who want more government in both are populists and those who want less government in both are libertarians although i dont think the populist label is accurate as bernie sanders and donald trump are populists without those conditions i think that is an overall good summary of the current democrat and republican views
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont forget drugs for some reason there is a real incessant desire to stop people from having fun with particular substances but others that have been scientifically proven to be much worse for you like alcohol and tobacco are aokay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and the war on drugs lest we forget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,vote libertarian were consistent at least google us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what rights do gay people and women not have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the genderorientation thing is ridiculous but the abortion thing at least is logical and straight forward they believe that at the moment of conception a human life is created killing innocent human lives is obviously an attack on personal liberty thus they believe it is wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wonder when this thread is gonna get locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i will leave my mark here before the mods lock this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well less regulation would mean that everyone has equal rights but they just dont understand that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait can someone explain to me the womens rights being referred to im not hip on politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never realized how misogynistic the social issue were
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ever heard of libertarians
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its insane what people think conservatism really is after reading this thread of nonsense yes all republicans are bible beating psychos who think gays should have no rights and hate helping poor people s you people live in a bubble
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rfellowkids level memeing here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this like a democratic sub now seems like a lot of posts here recently are like this one like i agree with it and all but i come to bpt im here for funny shit i get my daily dose of anti republican circle jerking by looking at the comments on rpolitics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,democrats we need more regulation regulate the businesses regulate gun control regulate antiquated state laws what about government regulating abortion dont tell me what to with with my body
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thread is locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,smh 😔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah fuck this didnt sub to bpt to see political posts bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this thread is gonna be gud 🍿🍷
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol best meme ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this kind of works except when you realize that republicans want to stop funding abortion clinics because they want nothing to do with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its almost like the two party system was created to keep people divided and angry at each other over social issues so they can continue to do shady shit that keeps all of us down abortion for example back before someone decided to weaponize it in politics it was something you quietly went and had done and no one talked about then as soon as the cold war ended in and everything was about unity equality and coming together both sides republican and liberal at the same exact time decided to take the following stances abortion is baby murder and an act against god abortion is about controlling women a sexist plot everytime times become peaceful the two party system finds something new to pit us against each other with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish i could upvote this million times i hate hypocritical republicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why we need to vote for hillary and put an end to those double standard inducing fascists then righteous consistent democrats will rule for as long as there is good in this world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but thats not republicans political viewpoint thats democratic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i seen this guy before he shitposts so much on twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont get it those are about state rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets just make murder legal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ohhh laawwwdd wheres my popcorn bowl🍿🍿🍿
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the abortion thing makes absolutely no sense unless you think the government shouldnt get all up in our business about murder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what rights do women not have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two of those things are the same abortion involves two people not one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deregulate homicide
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok so were still not done w this meme gotcha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what womens rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a pretty good misrepresentation of what people actually think its hilaaaaarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone us mature republicans has to regulate the lives of you godhating weedsmoking gayloving babykilling liberals because yall have lost your damn minds 😤😤😤😡
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always found that this showcases it pretty well you have to take personal freedoms and economic freedoms as separate metrics edit guys this graph is a caricature dont take it too seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what makes no sense business regulations are what we need to ensure justice and quality of life look at environmental regulations so important but yet so hated by republicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that confusing they view abortion as murder of an innocent child you can oppose regulation on business and murder without any contradictions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarianism is basically just athiest republicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its simple business make products that we use and consume who cares if those are safe but when it comes to your body and relationships thats just good policy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why conservative and republican are not synonymous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same with democrats they want big government for economic issues and small for social issues libertarians are the ones who really want small government in both social and economic policies edit im not advocating for any one over the others its just the way the political compass works generally libertarians want smallsmall republicans smallbig democrats bigsmall and authoritarian bigbig when it comes to economicssocial issues generally speaking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,straight up the opposite of what i believe in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,less laws no laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta make that money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly if this confuses you its because youve never thought deeply about this issue to put it simply regulating markets is entirely different from having a rule of law conservatives want people to make decisions for themselves which means deregulating markets and protecting people from violence and coercion prolife people aim to protect the fetus not control the mother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah it sounds confusing but conservatism is really just another words for traditionalism so its not inconsistent for them to want to expand free market and regulate personal freedoms libertarianism is really freeing up all government restriction possible i honestly didnt get that for a long time until i had i professor explain it to me but it makes more sense when you consider the context of how the conservative and liberal generally gradual change in society platforms have changed from the beginning of the country until now pretty interesting stuff dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the true republican ideals are about letting the states decide and not on a federal level
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a christian and a conservative politically this has also always confused me even if i were to disagree with them on a personal level that doesnt mean politically they dont have these rights or that its up to the government to regulate them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont understand why economic and social issues always have to go hand in hand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats probably because youve only understood conservatism as the caricature that messages like these tweets provide youre making the mistake of seeing this as being about deregulation in the libertarian sense of the idea because they are the people who hold up the most extreme version of the right just in the same way that a less sympathetic person who identifies with the right sees the ideas of the left as some kind of leninist radicalism but conservatism isnt libertarianism libertarianism is a small section of conservative conclusions not basic tenets taken to extremes like communism is to the ideas of the left the basic tenet of conservatism is that humans are pretty flawed we are easily persuaded into fallacious ideas and are generally incapable of being able to grasp the world in enough breadth and detail to make fundamental changes to it without creating a myriad of unforseen conquences and ripple effects that are usually as bad or worse than what we were trying to fix in the first place one answer that the classical liberals came up with was for the authorities to interfere as little as possible in peoples decision making this is where all the brands of libertarian you see now come from so that adaptation to the myriad circumstances and details of real life would occur in as fine grained way as possible its a pretty simple idea and with a lot of problems but also with a lot of merit as well the moral side that you see as being incompatible is something that comes from the first idea not the classical liberal solution that you mistake for conservatism of course there is also the religious dogma element that got into the mix when the conservatives started looking around for allies but that is a muddying of the waters it isnt really a conservative philosophical tenet although thats probably a bit more complicated than i have the will to go into here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like republicans are rich or wealthier then everyone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,welcome to politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same for the left though we want more freedom except shit like guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its actually consistent its justa misunderstanding of what government does government protects all of those three government is the reason you cant just say um we dont want abortions in our community with community being say the state of virginia or texas government protects womens rights without government they would be free to intimate and harass those rights out of usefulness which is why they dont want government intervention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you cant abort the baby it has rights i need money to feed my starving toddler i dont give a shit about that baby youre not getting my tax dollars
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers george carlin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the main reason i am for abortion because the people who want them cannot and do not want to support a child this will make both lives worse thus it outweighs the taking of a life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but theres adoption
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i think trump is the logical result of decades of neoconservatism the party created him and now a lot of them are disgusted at what theyre seeing what did they expect down the line he represents everything theyve stood for for the past years the silver lining is that theyre probably going to take the biggest l theyve had in a long time this election i really hope they respond to it with major changes to their platform if they nominate someone like kasich next time at least there would be an adult conversation on stage at the debates
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people often try to say the democrats and republicans are equally as bad but i just cant agree democrats are pretty out and open about wanting to tax and spend wanting progressive social legislation and even stuff like super delegates was right out in public republicans on the other hand directly work on a premise of misinformation they regularly try to pass legislation that actively hurts poor people women and minorities they claim freedom then want to curtail legal marijuana gay eights and abolish planned parenthood since nixon at least theyve been a part that absolutely depends on voters who dont know what theyre actually voting for to boot the democrats still work across party lines at a national level the republicans have engaged in obstruction that borders on treason especially with the debt ceiling how can they possibly claim to care about american citizens when they actively do anything they possibly can to stop any legislation that didnt come from them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this has been my opinion at least partially for the last couple cycles the white protestant camouflagewearing rural demographic doesnt win elections anymore having a candidate wave the bible and proclaim he was chosen by god makes people literally cringe and walk out of the party you can defend your position with religion all you want but that just alienates everyone who doesnt believe in it and diminishes your credibility into a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i like it when blackpeopletwitter threads get political and actual beneficial thoughtful political conversations happen also showing idiocy with repubs is a bonus joke guys chill
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember you said you use to be a republican what was the final straw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,prolly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hopefully not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,parties need to stop pandering to the fringe on both sides if they want to be taken seriously jill stein yesterday doubled down on her view on wifi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats aleppo 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like public roads too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarianism is one of those things that sound good because its simple but then you realize in reality the world just doesnt work like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gary sold out his policies are assbackwards
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive always wondered how those things can be considered morally against the word of god but bankers and corporations ostensibly refusing to render unto caesar what is caesars isnt or for that fact helping the poor taking off for the sabbath
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the bible is so full of shit i mean your telling me jesus was a carpenter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the irony of people fighting for abortion rights is that if you look at the statistics minorities get abortions at a far higher rate than white people which means that if the conservatives were as racist and malicious as you want to think they are they would literally be fighting for abortion rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most communities arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apart from the lgbtq please tell me which community is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,let me kill my child dammit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least fl got the drug court program u know the more economically savvy way to make money off addicts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i get annoyed when my conservative friends will use all kinds of drugs at parties and then scoff at the idea of legalizing mostall drugs and ending draconian drug laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or making sure people are using the right bathrooms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or how political this sub in general has become
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😚
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no real name its just a gif of conceited a battle rapper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he thought they were taking about a si section and got nervous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no csection no csection youre a csection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you not know what a partialbirth abortion is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,should we remove
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not arguing for it but prolife people count the unborn as a life so it shouldnt be hard to see why they wouldnt consider abortion a private matter the same way a woman killing her baby isnt a private matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is extremely simple life is sacred to christians they do not believe mothers have the right to kill their own unborn children you can disagree with that as much as you want but the stance is extremely clear
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,euphoric republican here my affiliation is a tenuous one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it was around the that the gop started courting church leaders to convert active christians into a new voter base before that politics and religion had been largely separate in the us or so some podcast said gotta figure that out freakanomics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even worse is that they use the grim nature of late term abortions to paint the picture of all abortions which is straight wrong and manipulative i can understand how the grim nature of late term abortions may want you to prioritize life over autonomy of the mother or the life of the mother herself but if the way trump framed it in the debate is why theyre against it then it doesnt apply to normal abortions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if only my republican friends were as logical as you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets cut taxes for the rich and spend another couple trillion on another war
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not always plenty think gay marriage shouldnt be allowed or abortion should be illegal due to murder also being illegal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all of reddit really on both sides
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes stupid people with no knowledge of the law or civics will say no but theyre wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,men cant get preggerino
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sadly there is no fiscal conservative socially liberal party in america we havent had a candidate on either side for a while that met those standards also
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is stopping abortion being moral
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes also sky is blue water is wet and im not getting laid tonight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets please forget about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whos saying women cant have guns 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so a year old who was raped should have to keep the baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleting opposing opinions i see
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this bitch dont know bout pangea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,truu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone knows who you are no one cares though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the reproductive rights of women have been under relentless attack by republicandominated state legislatures via various trap laws thankfully many of these have been struck down by the court but all the supreme court needs is one more old white conservative to completely overturn roe what rights to lgbt people do have they do not enjoy at either the federal level or in most states protection from discrimination that is afforded to you that is afforded to women that is afforded to people with disabilities that is afforded to religious people you would know this if you just paid attention to our current laws and politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were working overtime here if we get through the eye of the storm rall this wont be locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont and are you insinuating that this somehow mitigates the pronounced misogyny and homophobia still prevalent in our own culture i dont understand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally the only argument i hear against gay marriage is religious everything else is always some variant of gay people are icky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,perhaps the platform has secular arguments but religion is still the major influence and those secular reasons dont make much sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice twist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure that the government doesnt pay for women to get abortions they just give funding to places that also happen to give abortions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was gonna post about politics but then i got high
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol except it isnt what country are you from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the thread actually isnt too bad so far
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its about taking them away not giving them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think we should just say fuckit and lobby for politician body cams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think ill stick with my idealistic fiscally conservative socially liberal beliefs keep the reds in the business sector blues in the social sector
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey we dont hate god
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont worry there are some out there that are not socially bat shit crazy we even detest ones that are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i just say how appreciative i am that your flair says mod i wouldnt have known otherwise so thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you forgot browner skin appreciating
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look what we did to gucci 😎
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres morality issues and economic issues so sad you dont see the difference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,showcases what this is from nationstates an online game dont use it for actually analyzing real politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i swear i have never seen a political spectrum graph that didnt make me cringe and this isnt the exception political ideologies are too complex to put on a spectrum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its neat but it appears to portray libertarians as anarchists which is not accurate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nationstates country types used in actual political discussion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where would real countries place on that list for example the us sweden the netherlands and north korea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nationstates
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,would be nice to have some modern labor laws too required payed time off for things like sick days and maternity leave i keep hearing how we cant afford it yet we can afford wars in iraq and afganistan and huge subsidies for companies like monsanto and att which already make record profits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well the environment doesnt matter as long as you now that jesus will descend and scoop up all the nice christians and maybe the jews too and leave the gays and atheists to dwell on this hellish land
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay and gay marriage and weed legalization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that doesnt really explain their views toward gay marriage access to contraception and everything else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gay marriage doesnt involve murder as far as i know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clean coal fuck nuclear smdh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarianism teeters an anarchist line under the guise of muh constitution and the republicans run a party of obstructionism its absurd theyve created this narrative that government doesnt work while actively prohibiting it from working like they complain about government being inefficient while refusing regulation or that taxation is theft but dont to lose the benefits that government provides self awareness is not a strong point with conservatives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the moral majority supports legislators who oppose abortions but also oppose child nutrition and day care from their perspective life begins at conception and ends at birth barney frank
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre preborn youre fine if youre preschool youre fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he opened that bit and i think his show with why is it that most of the people that are against abortion are people you wouldnt wanna fuck in the first place rip george carlin legend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we know this is true because a comedian said so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im for abortion but i think u just gave the case for adoption
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the weakest justification for abortion out there why dont we use the same logic to euthanize all the kids in foster care why not it would benefit everyone else it comes down to the rights of the woman and determining what point in the pregnancy the fetus has its own rights economics are not relevant in the discussion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is some very flawed logic with that logic they could go ahead and abort their yo just cause they decide theyre not ready for this whole parenting thing both lives will be worse so i guess that morally outweighs killing him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this exact argument could also be used to advocate infanticide though if they see it as murder your point is completely moot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thus it outweighs the taking of a life so i can kill my children if i lose my job or simply do not want to support a child
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump has been the least religious republican in a while thats why pence was needed for vp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus was black ronald regan was the devil and the government is lying to us about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,donald his campaign are the gop post civil rights act the southern strategy incarnate i have no sympathy for the gop or fretting r candidates this is the bed youve made festooned bought a matching bedroom set for now lay in it lee atwater ronald reagan and his announcing candidacy in ms nixon his law order bs the religious rightmoral majority hijacking giving the tea party batshit crazies a megaphone access codes etc etc etc all coming to bear
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think a lot of republicans are truly disgusted with what theyre seeingtrump is just the first to brazenly yell out what gop has until this point been too smart to directly talk about and as a result hes risking gops reputation as poor as it already was so now they all scramble to say no thats totally disgusting that doesnt reflect the opinions of gop they know that if they were to be truly honest about their motivations and their opinions it would cost them votes and control they know that using subtle tactics to inch toward their goals is much safer for the party than going mexicans are evil deport them all a lot of trumps actual outlooks are pretty well inline with that gop typically supports antichina antitax on rich antiminority its just that trump was stupid enough to take the direct route toward pursuing those goals making the racist motivations behind those goals very obvious gops entire platform has been pretty much pursue racist goals but dont be really obvious about it because people find that distasteful trumps platform is pursue racist goals because fuck those people im the greatest its the difference between dividing voting districts to dilute minority votes and building a wall and deporting all the mexicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is kasich an improvement compared to trump kasich is even more religious than trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they are disgusted at what they see because trump isnt a neocon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think there was a single event im still registered as a republican i just gradually became more and more alienated by their social platform id never been a straightticket voter and over the last years ive found myself voting for fewer and fewer republicans especially at the national level when i was the contrast between the two parties wasnt so highthere was abortion but nobody mentioned samesex marriage everyone was tough on drugs i just cant trade equality and personal liberty for a strong economy and more efficient government
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she forgot a very important rule never go full retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you would think people running for potus would have a basic understanding of how technology works we are being screwed over no matter who wins because none of them understand technology in the slightest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure its a mediterranean dish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how many extra chromosomes do you have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and i bet a large majority of voters cant name another city in syria aleppo isnt even the biggest city in the country
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and obama once said there were states a gaffe is a gaffe get over it at least he isnt under investigation like both the main candidates are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,muh roads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not libertarian but thats a gross misrepresentation of what they want to achieve youre thinking of anarchocapitalists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarianism is astrology for men
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarianism communism both suffer from the same problem great on paper but the human condition fks it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats like calling light socialism communism libertarians dont mean ancaps
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep both johnson and weld were complete and utter failures as governors thats exactly why they got reelected in blue states wait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is there a quote about abortions in the bible or is there stance against it just a belief and ideology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just amazed by how many people think abortion is literally murdering babies but the most theyre willing to do to stop it is sharing some annoying facebook memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he was non union tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jews hire carpenters they arent carpenters themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the reason he died early was because he was ashamed of being associated with such shitty craftsmanship of the cross basically died of embarrassment and prayed god would forgive the craftsman since he did not know what he was doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bit of a reach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some prolifers are less in favor of banning abortion as they are for the type of community assistance that makes less women choose to abort in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not irony on the part of conservatives its cognitive dissonance on the part of leftist observers that think conservatives are racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so lets beat up the blacks for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the youth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but then their dea buddies will have to buy their own drugs for their bachelor parties instead of just dipping into the evidence locker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump is more pro legalization than hillary stein and johnson too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no political posts unless they are prohillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its called black people twitter not rmakewhitepeoplefeelcomfortable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know thats what its called but i love the idea of a career having a subtype thats just battle thats metal af oh youre a lawyer what kind of law do you practice property tax no im a battle lawyer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ripping babies right out of pussies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i say yes because i know there have been lines drawn in the sand about what political posts can stay up and what cant and honestly this post isnt even funny its just making the comments terrible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think you should this isnt a politics sub i wouldnt call this somebody being hilarious on social media
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i get that but its the desire to have smaller government while still having a hand in peoples lives thats the part i dont get
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is a fine belief to have but if they dont want to support the mother and the child after the birth then that is a huge problem it might be philosophically justifiable but practically speaking it is a disaster believes are all good to have but if those believe dont function well then those believes shouldnt influence politics if youre against abortion you should also support things such as good and thorough sex ed accessible contraceptives a substantial welfare system affordable healthcare lgbt adoptions etc because those are all things that would make abortions less necessary either by preventing pregnancy to ever happen or give more security and stability to the mother and the child
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,politics and religion used to be mostly seperate because both major parties were heavily religious the democrats gradually became more secular and started adopting policies that are opposed to christian values so christians became a large voting base
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,both of my republican friends have the same beliefs that the party went down hill has soon as they embraced the christian right in the country republicans used to be about freedom and shit and now they are the ones talking about how the amendment is too one sided and complaining that the christians are being persecuted bitch like of the country christian its not possible for you all to be persecuted maybe its because my friends are california republicans that make them slightly more logical and less likely to be taken by fits of but muh jesus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol me too bud why does everyone have to be so serious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who wants a war this time hillary is the one who wants to enforce a nofly zone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but this post said abortion womens rights implying they meant something other than abortion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,please i would love to know how their sexist against women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pro life but i think we can all agree situations like this are horrible however they are also rare less than of abortions are due to rape or health risk to the mother i cant blanket justify abortion due to that those are special cases
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so a baby doesnt have rights when it is inconvenient to the mother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even as a very christian guy myself i still feel like gay marriage should by all means be legal i feel like its wrong for people to deny the happiness of others simply because of their own religious beliefs i wish there was a way for me to show other christians what i mean without being judged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey i can make an argument thats not religious if your actually interested in hearing it ill pm you cant post it on reddit because i dont want to lose the spec of karma that i have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally the only argument i hear against gay marriage is religious but everything else is always some variant of gay people are icky so which is it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was gonna start a debate but then i got high
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea my bad i had it flipped
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because x comments have been removed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what rights are they trying to take away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was more in favor of making politicians wear jackets like nascar drivers where they have patches for every personcompany thats sponsoring them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think that is called cspan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a side plot in the novel the circle by dave eggers its a dystopia take on the future if a facebook like company kinda takes over i think on the surface the camera idea is attractive but would ultimately end up being a totalitarian nightmare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best idea ever from george bush
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but its ok when they do it just look at trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,weiner said you can cam with him anytime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is basically a libertarian then although the libertarian party in the us is a little off the rails in keeping with this ideology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish that could be an actual thing but if you want to be fiscally conservative what social programs would you cut to save money would you still be considered socially liberal if you started hacking away at all the different social programs people rely on to live would you still be considered fiscally conservative if you didnt make cuts to different entitlement programs established to achieve a socially liberal agenda
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except most people dont have a clue what this means and the reds have royally fucked up the economyso
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,politician body cams dassit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh man i forgot about nationstates my shit is probably in shambles in there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,showcasing how you should separate personal and economic freedoms i made no claim about analyzing real politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well if you read the wikipedia article on libertarianism its not too far off most leftlibertarians are anarchists and believe the state inherently violates personal autonomy but anyway i was only trying to show how its useful to separate economic and personal freedoms im not trying to pass off the graph as accurate or anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre closer to anarchy than the center but more pragmatic gary johnson is a moderate libertarian to the point where many extreme libertarians dont like him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anarchists simply believe in a society without hierarchy the idea that it means chaos and destruction is part of the indoctrination that you need a master
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarians are anarchist unless you are talking about right libertarians
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no its because those companies will have smaller profits this quarteralthough overall will have more in the long run and so we have to scorch our employees until they leave and everything comes crashing down in two quarters otherwise the value will fall dont you see we have to do it for the investors who dont give a damn about our company
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for every regulation of that type the cost of employing those people increases those business might start to look for a location outside of our borders for sheer cost savings or competitive edge thats the theory anyways a lot of people have different opinions of how increased regulations affect a localized economy maximizing social welfare and economic welfare at the same time turns out to be pretty tricky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gays are possessed and weed is satan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guess it is that confusing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well gay marriage is a sin in their eyes but the main producers of weed is to the south of us big cigarette companies dont want to lose their business to them seriously weed is only illegal because we dont produce enough of it ourselves to meet consumer demand also with it being illegal those who do sell make a way bigger profit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it totally does if you see it as your obligation to god to allow as few sins to be committed as possible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think big government is usually meant more in the sense of more state programs and bureaucracy such as welfare and public services or obamas national healthcare republicans would want most of them privatized in some way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really big government isnt a goal of democrats i guess that statement isnt wrong but democrats need big government to implement their policies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,by big government i meant higher taxes and more programs like social security and medicare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,republicans want the government out of your pocketbook but in your bedroom democrats want the government out of your bedroom but in your pocketbook i for one want the government in both t tankie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big government isnt a goal of democrats flat out wrong the staples of their modern policy are welfare socialised healthcare high taxes equality and regulation all of these require huge government
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i believe they are speaking in generalities but as a whole both have polar ideologies of the role of government all except for taking care of themselves i mean they agree on that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck nuclear you may be thinking of the antiwifi green party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,moderate libertarians do exist i would consider myself one i really liked bernie because while he supports a safety net which i agree with albeit socialist in nature he was also against special treatment and unfair market advantages for big corporations which libertarians are also against a level competitive playing field for everyone with assistance for those struggling to put food on the table and pay for treatment of preventable illness is the way to go imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no homo we smokin penises young thug
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well there is some truth to it who are the most likely to join the military upper class and upper middle class or the poorlow middleworking class i belong the last one thus the reason i joined parents couldnt afford to pay for college and i had no idea what to do with my life the options are a bit constrained when money is tight oh yeah and there are some that joined out of fervent patriotism but those are very rare at least navymarine side from my experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i ignore the meaning of someones message because of the median they choose to share it in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,george carlin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ad hominem is a fools refuge they are merely words its not about true or false its prose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we know this is true because it was written by carlin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a dead comedian no less so its sacred now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,adoption is a good thing but theres over babies and children waiting to be adopted right now most of whom wont be perhaps we should work through the backlog a little
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the notion that adoption can replace abortion is wrong anyone can make a kid but they dont let just anyone adopt a kid its not an evenmoney proposition
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then republicans say lgbt people cant adopt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you want everyone to abort their babies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fool in years theyll come back seeking vengeance because you abandoned them put under by your own scorned child
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a supply and demand for adoption youll end up with more children up for adoption than people even want to adopt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but it costs to give birth in a hospital in the us necessitates months of recovery and will have an impact on your body for years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the difference is that a fetus doesnt have a nervous system and cant actually think or feel pain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the point he was making is that socially trump is stupidly conservativereactionary and thats what the republicans have focused on in the past he might not quote religion while doing it but he represents the ideas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you have another dream where you made the white people lose their minds again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,huey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what did i tell you about telling white people the truth they cant handle it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yall heard it george bush himself told us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it sounds like youre a republican but the republican party isnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this might be the first election where i just go in and hit the big d button the gop has become a complete joke lately theyve been forcing democrats toward the middle since the late maybe now its their turn to chill and put up candidates like kasich who are a tad more liberal if they want to be taken seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the one with clams right delicious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats why theyre a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,libertarians in generalaiight but this dude wants to be president
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do they just have no interest in anything outside the us genuinely asking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is not wanting to bomb everyone the same as not giving a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait not giving a fuck about foreign policy is a tenet of libertarianism if thats true thats an impressively stupid level of wilful ignorance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rwhowillbuildtheroads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well gary johnson was booed pretty hard at his partys convention when he dared to suggest that drivers licenses might not be the worst thing ever i can imagine that some of the same people arent too fond of public roads either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my first arguments with a libertarian was talking about how the government should not be involved with roads and that we should have a exclusive set of roads for the rich so that they never have to deal with traffic because their time is worth more naturally this privilege would be based on paying for it of course even then i find the libertarian view of the world completely disregards individual incentives and basic human psychology if i told you to make as much money as you can in four weeks you would have a very different approach that if i told you to make as much as you can in one week because that determines if you even get another week right now we have people who can make everything they need in that one week and who cares if everyone else gets fucked for the next three weeks because they left to do the same elsewhere before shit hit the fanwhile being labeled as a genius in the process
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anyone who disagrees with me is crazy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically just a separate ideology there is this crazy story about a guy named onan that was ordered by god to fuck his brothers wife and impregnate her he did so reluctantly and when he came he pulled out and jizzed on the floor god killed him for that somehow that morphed into dont use condoms and carry the baby to term
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres an httpsenwikipediaorgwikihomunculushistory of how pregnancy works that there are actually tiny fully formed humans contained in the sperm if you follow that theory to its logical conclusion masturbation contraceptives and abortion are all morally equivalent to murder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from what i know we dont have abortion mentioned by name but im saying that on a guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is a quote about how youre a servant of god before birth which would imply that abortion is literally murdering these young disciples however the verse is still open to interpretation imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the debate about abortion shouldnt be about whether or not its moral because its kind of hard to argue that it is moral it is fundamentally killing an innocent human life im pro choice but i completely understand the other ideology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abortion was not a procedure that could have been done in biblical times its not mentioned for a reason because it didnt exist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not sure where anyone is getting that there isnt some ballpark mention of it in the bible it says somewhere if you harm a pregnant woman and the mother survives but the baby dies it counts as murder theres also a lot of mentions in the bible of god referring to people as who theyll become while theyre in the womb like how it says the fetus in mary will become jesus and other such examples scattered throughout all of the bible edit meaning the bible considers a fetus as the future person it will be and not just a clump of cells or something like that also the fetus of john the baptist kicked in the womb when the pregnant mary with the fetus jesus entered the room plus i knew you before you were in the womb or something like that that suggests some form of us was known to god before conception having said all that the bible also an honestly more importantly says jesus forgives murder and any sin as long as you ask
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the people who grind gears are the morons who say have that kid phew she was born now screw your lazy familyyou should have worked harder if you wanted to afford baby foodclothes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,very true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is your argument literally liberals are secretly racist because they support abortion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you arent wrong by any means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hang them from trees thatll teach them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they are very similar both for medical marijuana open to states rights to legalize not ready federal legal weed clinton has spoken a bunch on decriminalization etc etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well hillary is basically a conservative by every available metric
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ofcourse because its black people twitter go find a black person who tweets funny pro trump tweets and post them the mods wont ban you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,post in question has virtually nothing to do with race aside from black guy in pic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from my dads point of view in the uk he has literally nothing against gay couples isnt rascist at all etc however he didnt think gay people should be allowed to marry he just thought it was a religious thing defined as being between a man and a woman its more like he had never really considered it could be a thing than he hating the idea of it more of a why change something from my religion when you could make your own thing some people dont consider that despite being a religious thing originally it has evolved into being something based in law that affects your taxes etc he would undoubtedly have said the same thing about two atheists getting married after putting it to him in that context he has nothing against it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all of government is an intrusion in peoples lives unless you are an anarchist then you do believe in having a hand in peoples lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its literally the same thought behind wanting to make murder illegal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre against abortion you should also support things such as good and thorough sex ed accessible contraceptives a substantial welfare system affordable healthcare lgbt adoptions etc im not even a christian im just arguing on their behalf because of the insane way people misconstrue them on reddit however to continue playing devils advocate there isnt really any contradiction between not wanting sex talk in schools welfare social healthcare gay adoption rights etc and wanting abortion to be illegal you can very easily just say that you want the government to protect the life of the unborn child legally but dont want them touch any of the other subjects at all there is no contradiction at all there the contradiction only shows up when you believe its the governments responsibility to guarantee everybodys safety and wellbeing but also dont want them to do any of those things most christians dont believe that is the governments responsibility at all but do believe it is the govs responsibility to legally enforce laws like murder which they consider abortion to be similar to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where in california im going to just say it straight out i find there types of california republicans those who live around minorites regardless of income level and those who dont i find the ones who live around minorities to be generally be socially liberal but fiscally conservative generally you can have a conversation with them they stick to logical points when arguing and they dont deny that shit happens to people other than them the rest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,goldwater needed to win in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and donald is the one who asked why dont we use nukes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hillary does not want war with anyone by the way thats a republican funded lie and a pathetic attempt to smear her campaign
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she wants to negotiate one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anti reproductive rights anti women in the military anti civil rights protections omg big government making me not be a turd wahhh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre also against someone having the choice to sell a wedding cake to whomever they want but a woman can choose to kill her baby its a law
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lgbt are not subject the protections of the civil rights act and few states include the same employment and discrimination protections to lgbt provided women minorities and religious people the relevant law is the which ive provided in its entirety so you can see for yourself is a story and list of states where discrimination against lgbt people is completely legal you can read about house republicans blocking the passage of enda which would have virtually rectified the deficiencies in the civil rights act oh but you were asking for one system or institution of government or a law a rule or a person in power that still hasmakes laws that discriminate against gays and women please name one ok heres in the senate see previously article for the information on the house shall we keep going what else you got for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its not like gay men are going to get married to women or lesbians married to men so i dont see why they have in interest in stopping them others than for religious purposes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except those incentives are from the when children only had a chance to live past five it was a genuine constant threat that the population would dwindle or die out but that threat is virtually gone now with modern medicine out population increased by in just over a century additionally most gay and lesbian couples who are so committed they want to be legally bound together are likely eager to start a family the reason its so hard for them to do so is and adopt kids is religious stigma so they have to turn to expensive alternatives like invitro fertilization or adopt outside the us theres no valid argument against samesex marriage in except religious stigma and gay people are icky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess i misspoke the religious arguments were there only ones said to me everything else was just stuff i saw in internet arguments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it happens
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,voting abortion and the constitution actually doesnt explicitly guarantee equal rights based upon sex pregnancy discrimination act title vii title ix outside of policy there is a lot of thinly veiled sexism which would probably be much more widespread if republicans could do so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hillary would need a big ass jacket
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is when pacs that hate gay rights start naming themselves freedom for all americans pac with a logo thats a giant rainbow american flag patch looks great on tv but really theyre trying to get gay people back on death row
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a chrome plugin called greenhouse that shows donation info when you hover of a politicians name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think that would only make it culturally acceptable that we are an oligarchy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like a list on each ballot next to candidates names should be a list of like the top sponsors to their campaign thatd be pretty nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u talkin bout grabherbythepussygate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its the libertarian party if they decide to do this all at the state level i would probably join that party but theyre diluted they refuse to acknowledge federalism won out of all parties ive seen more libertarians claim laws they disagree with are unconstitutional the supreme court has ruled over and over again congress can legislate out of implied powers you cant go around claiming laws are illegal because you disagree with the legally upheld implied powers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea which is unfortunate if you tell people youre a libertarian you get associated with the absolute nutjobs leading the party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the libertarian party on reddit is completely off their rocker theyre basically anarchists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think most people have the wrong idea about taxes and the governments intended role regarding use of taxes taxes are necessary and should be used for public services and infrastructure there is no reason a fiscally conservative government cant generate and enforce a taxation on the people that is used to provide roads schools police military and necessary social programs like disaster relief none of these are considered social welfare if we look at social welfare then it becomes more difficult for the fiscally conservative government to feel motivated to provide tax revenue unemployment food stamps medicaidmedicare technically everyone is entitled to these benefits and in that regard its not outside the belief of a fiscally conservative government the issue is making sure there isnt abuse or reliance on the programs because then the reds start to see it as a pitfall but thats kind of why the two entites need to work together
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the definition of libertarian isnt set in stone but in the usa it usually refers to rightlibertarianism perhaps in the chart they did mean left
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anarchy means without rulers not without rules there are two types of anarchists those who want a society based on voluntary association and those the ones you describe that have an issue with voluntary hierarchy a professorstudent relationship is a hierarchy i dont think anyone would reasonably see as wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that obligation is to yourself not to others
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just like republicans need big government to fund their bloated military
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i realize those things require bigger government but their goal isnt to make the government as large as humanely possible only large enough to be able to adequately support the public programs that have a net positive impact on society at a certain point you cant fix everything by increasing taxes but republicans are always aggressive about cutting taxes to the point where you can no longer help the people who actually need it then you are only lining the pockets of the rich while creating none of the economic growth that trickle down is supposed to offset lower tax revenues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they arent proposing higher taxes on the middle or lower class theyre seeking to get rid of loopholes that allow the rich to avoid paying taxes as well as moderate tax increases on those who make or more or was it cant remember the exact figure still the tax increases wouldnt bring rates close to what they were in the mid century even under republican presidents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,johnson is quoted as saying we need to use clean coal cus its the cheapest hes not anti tech
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude if you supported bernie you really need to read more about libertarianism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this a reference otherwise i think you meant to say medium
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kids up for adoption are kind of like the hot dogs you see in a gas station nobody wants the ones that have been sitting in there rolling around for a few days they want the fresh ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know its crazy that everyday on the front page of reddit i see that somebody adopted a dog from the pound i have never seen someone post a picture a child they just adopted y tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,newborns are highly in demand older kids get shuffled around foster care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol yea i fucked up the wording definitely meant pro choice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im out of the loop about the meme whats the history on it thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats already the case
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn being a women sounds like a drag tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these are all considerations for the woman to make tho not society at large
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like when he got the entire rnc to cheer for lgbt people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump is socially more liberal than anyone in the party he supports unions between gays just dont call it marriage to keep religious people happy still give them all the economic and tax benifits and etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at how well spoken you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gonna find me a white man and lie to him right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not just any george bush da real one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my city has the best mayor in the state and has for years hes a fairly liberal republican but ill be goddamned if im voting for anyone with an r next to their name if they havent said they refuse to support trump fuck em
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so we should blow up more brown people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not a fan of gary johnson and the aleppo thing was just pure ignorance but why is nonintervenionism a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont feel they are responsible for anything outside of the us that said i assume libertarians in general are as wellinformed as any other party its just that gary johnson is their candidate and he doesnt seem as wellinformed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hyperbole dude of course its important to know whats going on the world but in the scope of libertarianism you dont get involved with conflicts going in other territories noninterventionism rather than isolationism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that shouldve been interpreted as do what god tells you even if you dont like it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually onans father told him to do it his brother who was married to the brothers wife in question had passed away and it was understood according to gods law that the wife married the next available brother when that happened this was to keep the family line goingso that that brothers line wouldnt just end with him the child would be considered the child of the deceased man onan disobeyed because he didnt want to have a son who wasnt his and thats why he died i dont think your representation of the story was entirely fair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo god is wildin wtf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump on marijuana clinton on marijuana judge for yourself but for me it appears that trump wouldnt hesitate to legalize medical whilst clinton wants to do more research first when countless studies have already been conducted not just anectodical as she claims lets also not forget that she has big donors from the pharma industry who spend millions of dollars every year to fight cannabis legalization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,frankly its shouldnt be called a marriage on a state level call it a union or something a lot of the whole marriage is a holy ceremony between a man and a woman would lose its leg to stand on if they just didnt use the fucking word its like we are fighting over semantics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one is in socal were i am from very socially liberal very fiscally conservative the other is in the bay area and is pretty much the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean the bullshit made up rumor that cited unnamed sources and offering little context as to what had purportedly led trump to ask three times why the united states couldnt use nuclear weapons during a briefing that took place several months earlier that the reporter was not present for and claimed to learn about secondhand but hey if it confirms your confirmation bias and makes you feel better go for it that articles secondary headline stated if this is true its truly shocking but while the claim certainly turned heads its worth noting that scarborough was not a party to the conversation an msnbc executive said that scarborough heard the tale days before repeating it but the source and provenance of the anecdote were unclear
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anybody who is against women in infantry is not antiwomen in the military theyre antigiving unqualified people a job thats based on life and death scenarios in the name of equality its simple men are stronger than women men are built to withstand more damage than women so when you start mixing the less than ideal with the realities of war men are going to be the ones to pay the price when a woman who is insanely strong for her gender doesnt have the strength to carry a lbs marine with lbs of gear yards to safety because her strength shouldnt be compared to his size and weight and if you want to send women to war sign them up for the draft like the rest of us make allfemale battalions so when shit does hit the fan they have a chance of saving their comrades because there isnt an enormous size and strength disparity between one soldier and the next any republican or any person for that matter who doesnt want women in the military is the minority and if you bother to check the validity of that statement youd probably start to realize a lot of your preconceived notions about any peoples different from you isnt as accurate as you thought
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abortion killing a baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love how im still downvoted and youre still upvoted this sub kinda sucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abortion was already covered in the graphic so why cover it twice voting need a citation on that one the rest is all feels and no actual argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,multilayer trenchcoat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump would need a red russian parka
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shell be on some pimp c shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i think as a result of being a third party its overrepresented by the more extreme part of the ideology green party has the same problem the more reasonable people who align with either tend to just vote democrat or republican since theyre sortacloseenough and more pragmatically will get into office
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,our federalism was supposed to work that way the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people but obviously weve gone way the fuck off course on that one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think theyre necessarily trying to say the laws are illegal just that they think it goes against what they believe the ideals of the constitution are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the same as all the parties in fact that pretty much applies to all ideologies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well the graph is trying to be all inclusive so they had to fit anarchism in there somewhere but yeah its definitely not representative of libertarianism in the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true i would add involuntary authority to my post somewhere then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep while the aca did some good things its a terrible piece of legislation in the regard what we really need is nationalized healthcare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,privatized free market if you apply millions of regulations to an industry not even the private market can make it work the further and further healthcare has gotten from the free market the more expensive it has gotten ironically the proposed solution to a healthcare system ruined by the state is to allow the state to completely control healthcare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obamacare is privatized am i in crazy town
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right they both suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mid century tax rates were extremely heavily skewed due to the way the tax code worked then which meant that effective tax rates were far far lower than they looked much lower than they are today also even though the democrats arent proposing much of a tax raise this election it is a general tendency of left wing parties in general to want high taxes and lots of big government policies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the top of taxpayers already pay more in taxes than the bottom combined
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yay we too could have the air quality of beijing free market baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,coal isnt the cheapest option when coal plants actually have to deal with the pollution they produce
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,much of his rhetoric was similar to ron pauls noninterventionist foreign policy removal of special government advantages for big corporations etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive actually played with the idea of adopting a teenager im not too hot on the idea of raising a kid for years a significant portion of which you cant really relate on a grown level it would obviously be a different relationship i wouldnt try to control them as much i would have to see them as autonomous beings more than most adults probably the main problem would be that i would want them to go to college which could be difficult when im not with them their whole lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn bit of a dark analogy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds delicious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that parallel youre drawing is pretty heartless ive volunteered at orphanages most of those kids will never have a stable life because someone thought of them as old hot dogs at the gas station
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,much more expensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true seen it happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id hope so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tru
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,interestingly enough at that same convention they refused to encorporate lgbt rights into their platform they still have state governments trying to push for religious freedom bills that basically amount to the right to discriminate against lgbt people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill be impressed when the party platform doesnt oppose equal rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure but if he dies then pence is incredibly anti gay that and pro choice are the only reasons im voting for someone that should be in prison pence cant be president
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know about brown people without wanting to blow them up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but we should be making educated decisions about what we do in the world global security is not something to be fucked with willy nilly whoever is running the show should have at least a decent understanding of whats going on knowing what aleppo is is part of that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just because you dont want to intervene doesnt mean you cant be aware and understand the global political climate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,back when noninterventionism would have worked countries entire economies werent shackled to each other also wars killed way more people today any president needs to have diplomatic skills foreign diplomacy is literally job of the president behind commanderinchief if he doesnt know how to do that hes not gonna be doing much in office even if you think that the us shouldnt invade other countries and should stay out of other nations completely when it comes to military a president still needs to understand foreign affairs and diplomacy our economy is completely tied into the rest of the world and when other countries act it causes a reaction in the us whether we want it to or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,globalization is like quick sand once youre in deep enough theres no hope of leaving were for too intertwined militaristically commercially and economicallyvjust remove ourselves doing so would spell disaster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because russia and china arent joking around
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is a huge difference between nonintervention and being completely unaware what is going on in the world lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes thank you this dude was held to bring this woman a chill so that she didnt live without a job land or without income it wasnt so much that he came in the floor so much as it was that he was intentionally screwing her over out if the hatred of his heart god doesnt like it when you disobey especially when its intentional and wicked you dont see him killing all those kids who jack it every night i chalk it up to willful ignorance and manipulation of the higher church for their own benefit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt seem like either are against it from those videos to be honest both said they would want more research done in order to have legalization done safely and give states the choice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the problem with tradition is that you cant easily rename that kind of stuff without it losing its traditional feeling besides i could forsee people being angry that they had a category created for them because they arent allowed to use the one thats been around for thousands of years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay heres another just in case youre too full of yourself you know it used to be to the victor belong the spoils now there was no victor there believe me there was no victor but i always said take the oil
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if those senators and house republicans and the perhaps – people in the state legislatures that either actively vote against civil rights protections for lgbt people were just that about people who were plain old bigots id agree with you but these people arent acting in a vacuum theyre representing their constituencies these are real people – teachers doctors lawyers businessmen and women – who are opposed to their lgbt neighbors having full civil rights protections that is a serious problem and its an indication of a vicious strand of homophobia still present across large swaths of this country
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god bless you are employing the trump technique of argumentation i show you the evidence and you just brush it aside as if nothing ever happened if you would have opened the first link i provided in my response the very first fucking one you would have read sec a it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation terms conditions or privileges of employment because of such individuals race color religion sex or national origin you see if you had read that you wouldnt have said something as stupid as white people also arent subject to the protections of the civil rights act and insofar as republicans are pro free market having government regulate who private companies can and cannot hire is antithical to the the premise of a free market the free market can dictate whether or not business that dont hire or serve blacks jews etc deserve to stay in business i would show you where in the constitution congress is entitled to regulate interstate commerce what that means the relevant case law most notably heart of atlanta motel inc v united states but who am i kidding youd ignore that and keep on going like nothing ever happened
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would i need a citation its a womens right and no those titles are not feels
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that plays the old soviet anthem when you open it to expose yourself to miss latvia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you triggered some trumpettes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most ever spent on senate campaign and most ever spent on presidential pretty simple honestly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i think its an insight that the people who got together to agree on that passage also found common ground on the necessary and proper clause that gives our federalism so much power we can sit here and debate all night but wed just be rehashing what people argue now going back to the continental congress the clause gives congress the power to legislate out of powers theyre delegated but gives them the power to deal with new problems that might arise in the future that they could never predict its easy for people in the libertarian camps to try and apply an historical account of misintent plenty of founding fathers were alive to see it first used to grant large federalist powers with the national bank i dont recall any of them calling for another revolution this idea i see a lot from that side of the argument is you know the founding fathers would go nuts if they saw how the np clause has been applied well were talking about people who would probably shit their pants seeing black people voting and a mixed race president not to say they were bad people but an element of constitution is a product of its time thankfully whether people think its been used effectively or misused they gave our government the ability to use their delegated powers to legislate new problems that would happen down the road they couldnt imagine its probably a foundation thats responsible for the fact our country still exists the modern french german governments have only existed since the out of the major western powers only the uk usa have been around for quite awhile in any similarities of legislation enacted that empowers or restricts governments that have led to them surviving in the case of the usuk youll find people who vehemently agree and disagree with it and the roundabout here is that there are very real concerns with the necessary and proper cause the size and power of our federalism if people disagree with it and dont think its the right course of action i completely understand and i listen to what they have to say when they take it to the point of calling everything unconstitutional because its not explicitly listed in the constitution theyre basically saying i disagree with the marshall courts decision and while its fine to disagree the founders made the courts decisions on constitutionality the law of the land knowing full well people might end up on the court that they would disagree with so the marshall court rejections dont turn into a disagreement it turns into this fantasy of people thinking that because they dont agree with the court on the np clause that somehow those decisions never happened and theres this delusion that prevails that because of this fantasy that the federal government is somehow operating on this illegal power in its size the whole department of education energy defense irs being unconstitutional thats absolute absurdity and i cant take those people seriously unfortunately theyve sort of taken hold of the libertarian base which is a shame because i think the libertarians could have the chance to basically be the nonautistic version of the republican party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres plenty of things i agree with that party on in principle but they tend to nominate the crazies or the crazies become their political icons ive never seen any other party politicians claim things are unconstitutional on a regular basis as libertarians unconstitutional has a very specific meaning thats not something people throw around to imply we dont agree with its something patently illegal because the constitution voids its enforcement but my perspective is skewed my introduction to them and really getting into the nitty gritty of their views came with ron paul in and that man loved to claim it if he didnt like what he had for breakfast in the morning hed yell that bacon eggs are unconstitutional gary johnson supports a lot of the same positions as he did especially as far as dismantling the federal government but he has left out the constitutionality of it if its because it doesnt play well to claim of the federal government is illegally in place or whether hes not such a strict constitutionalist as paul i dunno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i realize that but for the gop and democrats its socially acceptable to support nutjobs somehow once you stray from that path youre a pariah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way ive been made to understand it libertarians basically want to keep the governments involvement in daytoday issues to a minimum is that about right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the republicans are the ones blocking that effort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arent aca premiums projected to rise something like next year thats not a number i look at and say hey thats a successful program why dont we nationalize it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the aca should be characterized as health insurance reform not healthcare reform it mandates people buy private health insurance off a marketplace its a handout to health insurance corporations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends what part of the bill you are talking about it is privatized in the sense that it requires you to buy health insurance from a private insurer with no public option the only thing public about it are the various subsidies people can qualify for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i disagree on that but it wasnt the point anyway lets just say efficiency all around would be a nice change of pace but im no libertarian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe because they have more money edit id also like to point out that the majority propose raising taxes for the top
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the top of taxpayers already pay more in taxes than the bottom combined source not saying youre wrong just curious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when all the rules have been written to protect you since the reagan era ya you can pay more now if we compromise by allowing fast food workers to unionize and be paid then we can talk about cutting taxes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats long term gary johnson dont give a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id want to do it too but like what if they just get to your house and just immediately start running away and taking your car and shit i have considered it i want to help but id be worried that my kid would be troubled from hisher life of being cast aside
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but completely true in addition to younger the more melanin a kid has less likely to be adoptedat any age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry that ive offended you but this is reddit many people make jokes and say things that dont actually reflect their own beliefs and character traits because of anonymity that and sweet sweet karma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree that understanding is crucial yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,agreed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically they would have to change the name to like a union and only people married through religious ceremony would get the spiritual definition of marriage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the gop presidential candidate said he would consider using a nuclear weapon if the us were attacked by the islamic state in iraq and syria im not going to use nuclear but im not taking any cards off the table in a new york times interview published over the weekend trump stressed the importance of unpredictability in his foreign policy he told matthews wednesday that youd be a bad negotiator for taking any strategy off the table yes his statement is out there im not condoning or defending it however he said he would consider nuclear if attacked first because he wants every option he has available not that he will nuke anyone that so much as looks at him that is not him saying he wants to go to war
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay heres another just in case youre too full of yourself did you even read the transcripts you blindly pulled a quote out of context from this is talking about the iraq war and the past and what trump thinks they should have done to prevent the rise of isis this isnt talking about him starting a war just what actions he thinks should have been undertaken during a war that was already ongoing to prevent another war from happening if anything you are providing evidence of trump wanting to stop future wars thanks full context trump sure i mean part of the problem that weve had is we go in we defeat somebody and then we dont know what were doing after that we lose it like as an example you look at iraq what happened how badly that was handled and then when president obama took over likewise it was a disaster it was actually somewhat stable i dont think could ever be very stable to where we should have never gone into in the first place but he came in he said when we go out — and he took everybody out and really isis was formed this was a terrible decision and frankly we never even got a shot and if you really look at the aftermath of iraq iran is going to be taking over iraq theyve been doing it and its not a pretty picture the — and i think you know — because youve been watching me i think for a long time — ive always said shouldnt be there but if were going to get out take the oil if we would have taken the oil you wouldnt have isis because isis formed with the power and the wealth of that oil lauer how were we going to take the oil how were we going to do that trump just we would leave a certain group behind and you would take various sections where they have the oil they have — people dont know this about iraq but they have among the largest oil reserves in the world in the entire world and were the only ones we go in we spend trillion we lose thousands and thousands of lives and then matt what happens is we get nothing you know it used to be to the victor belong the spoils now there was no victor there believe me there was no victor but i always said take the oil one of the benefits we would have had if we took the oil is isis would not have been able to take oil and use that oil
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not a puppet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrooooooong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then vs than
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh now i getcha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well first of all nobody is saying nationalize obamacare and those two words next to each other dont even make logical sense obamacare is a private healthcare mandate where private companies have to provide healthcare to certain people under certain regulations when people talk about nationalized healthcare theyre not talking about nationalizing a private exchange theyre generally talking about a single payer medicare style program where youre automatically enrolled you can have private healthcare on top of that if you wish but it is unnecessary for the vast majority of people obamacare is a republican plan from the and it was considered a big handout to private insurance companies back then and has very little to do with nationalized healthcare obamacare was going to have a public option where people could buy into medicare but that got cut at the last second as a classic obama compromise and as a result healthcare was worse for everyone and premiums rose more than they would have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i googled it because i was curious too most of what i read said but so what its not like it makes a tangible difference to the and the bottom of income tax payers cant afford it they pay a higher percentage of their overall income than do the richest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually i was wrong the top percent million filers paid a greater share of income taxes percent than the bottom percent million filers combined percent according to income tax data emphasis mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres definitely a high chance theyd be troubled i think you would just have to accept that and recognize that they stared off in that position and your presence can only help it would get difficult if they started trying to steal your shit or whatever though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna assume most kids in the system wouldnt throw away a legit home life so they can get arrested for stealing a car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you win an argument against a mod do they just ban you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just cut and pasted the exact language from the relevant bill that showed you were wrong when you said that white people also arent subject to the protections of the civil rights act and you just keep on going
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre the puppet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they dont its just that if you tax at youve only got but if you tax at youve still got obviously those arent the right figures but just as an example percentagewise theyre the same even though irl the tax rates actually go up as you get into higher brackets it just makes a bigger difference to the guy with than to the guy with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that says nothing about the relative tax burden a person who has paying in taxes has a much greater burden than someone who makes paying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for the source
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they need to shell out a little more for getting us into this mess lord knows they can afford it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cafe press
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gorillalivesmatter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some kind of subliminal messaging im sure

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but we dont diss those towns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,food and entertainment for me personally my town of has fuck all to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its all perspective always being in nyc you start to notice the more intricate details and minutiae of it and that can certainly make something lose its luster i grew up in bergen county and have wound up playing host to friends and relatives and that often means spending a day in ny and where theyre from south texas the philippines colorado ohio their downtown isnt even close you see it every day and its routine for them its like visiting another planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends a lot on what you do when you get there for one thing theres the sheer beauty of the city newark doesnt come close to it spend some time looking at the architecture then theres the culture world class museums shows even some of the shops are iconic my favourite thing about ny was always the neighbourhoods whenever i felt blasé about it all i could head to a different section of the city and be in a new world with different smells food people sounds etc spend some time just being in the village chinatown little italy soho etc the vibe is completely different
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres so much shit in ny not just manhattan most people that dont live here dont get to see other sides as much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no one in nyc or la has ever once in their life given a single shit about philly that said i love philly but this aint your battle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,about a notch below boston on the giveafuckometer the only third party that can maybe get in on the convo is chicago but they are still gonna be an alsoran

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its the alleys man theyre everywhere we hide our garbage and our homeless was that redundant i was appalled by the trash i saw blowing through times square at night i was impressed that no one acknowledged it

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah son everyone that thinks ny is dirty didnt grow up here this shit was disgustingly dirty now its just kind of messy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont know why you got downvoted couldnt be more true i flew up with my friend last year to see our favorite band we stayed in bushwick and were shocked to discover that brooklyn appears to pave their roads with large piles of discarded ramen and rotting cardboard

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for places like times square it blends into the background for me i really dont even notice it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dead meta b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would you go on vacation to the bronx
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean you were in bushwick

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok why are you telling me this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck you its got a viking centre

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,especially if youre on the train if you also see one guy in a train car causing a huge scene and being loud and wondering why no ones saying anything its because no one wants to potentially get stabbed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its weird how in most indoor situations its not an issue but out on the street you have to pretend no one exists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you staying in dead ass brooklyn or gluten free vegan brooklyn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe or

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how you gonna go to brooklyn let alone bushwick and complain about trash not only that the city is packed to the brim trash is part of the way of life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me talking about going to san francisco my grade year and my teacher giving some helpful information
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only lived there for two years and i literally forgot that most cities do not smell like that until i left also i got uncomfortably used to seeing people take shits on the sidewalk that city blows
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i went there once it was pretty neat i got a wooden sword that went all splintery after a month
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,da
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reminds me of germany 😄
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to get myself out of the habit i started focusing on five blocks down the street rather than whats in my immediate field of vision a close call with some dog crap every now and then is the price i pay for trying to go along to get along
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just tell him to visit both regardless of where hes staying though the gluten free musician area is definitely more surreal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or kosher brooklyn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have absolutely no clue its close to the middle of brooklyn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,grew up in mahwah i can visit but i dont miss living there too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first off no it absolutely does not and second who gives a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you cant disrespect the wawa i want them everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as long as they arent smothering it in fucking cheez whiz im with you cheesesteaks and roast pork sandwiches are the greatest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol i was in philly for most of the it was stupid how hard philly goes for a team that still hasnt won a super bowl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsgiantgfycatcomclutteredlimitedarchaeocetegif
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its when wealthier people move into an urban neighboorhood and leads to the rise of rents and to some extent changes the culture of the neighborhood in new york city a lot of young professionals are moving deeper into areas of brooklyn queens upper manhattan and the bronx which is causing poor families to move out since they cant afford to live their anymore in other words poor people are gettting displaced by young professionals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fact that you dont know what this is scares me but im glad youll learn something important today
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the ones we hurt are you and me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,karl kani for sure misspelled girbaud too but it doesnt matter because nobody wears them anymore except for a few homeless dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id rock pelle pelle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i tip them but thats because i was bag boy when i was younger it also depends on your location i grew up in the dc area so it is a little bougie in certain pockets of the area lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i worked in a grocery store it was pretty much only when you helped them to their car with the stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah one of those satirical novelty accounts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we dont claim him no more michael bloomberg also falls into that category with his shitty ass spanish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,helpful information
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit like this is the reason why i almost want to break up with my gf shes going to school for the tech field and im scared im going to live in oakland paying out the ass in rent and have to deal with getting my car radio stolen again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,go to brighton beach youll fit right in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i tilt my head down about degrees and hide the headphones and cell lock the jaw no one is going to stop you and less dog shit surprises
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in either brooklyn you are going to be listening to someones demo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,book a room at the oasis motel on pennsylvania ave and flatlands real ny experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if its north or west of prospect park itll be gluten free brooklyn if its south of prospect park itll be much less gentrified but probably getting there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i live in va and they are building one right in my hood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah man whiz wit is the chronic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you also get newcomers callling the cops on people who have been living in the neighborhood for years just for looking suspicious and other frivolous shit black churches in oakland had the cops called on them last year because their choir practices were too loud
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i still dont get it why would the wealthier people move into poorer neighborhoods do they want to save money or what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a lot of people have no idea what gentrification is its talked about all the time in cities but if you live in the suburbs or even more remote places people do not move around a lot and the concept of neighborhoods changing within years and people being priced out is not something that you ever think about so you cant blame them for their ignorance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not even close to russian though im dutch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your methodology appears sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah im good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you trying to give him bedbugs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white people do that out in the country too theyll build a house next to a farm that has been in that family for like generations now then complain to the city about animals fucking all the time and that it always smells like cow shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that sucks if anything i would want the church choir to sing louder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these people arent wealthy but mostly recent college grads and looking for affordable places to live that are closer to work its essentially the cycle of urban development a new generation of young professionals enter the work force since most dont have children and dont have to worry about school systems or quality of life they can choose to live in the more sketchy parts of the city they may not be wealthy but these young urban professionals or yuppies as their referred to can afford significantly higher rent this causes most property owners in these areas to renovate in order to attract high income renters and raise their rent with higher income comes higher tax revenue which leads to the development of parks and recreation facilities as well as the influx of businesses that cater to the yuppies like organic markets and starbucks this has the unintended consequence of pushing lower income renters off of the property because they can no longer afford to live there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from what ive read and a little bit of my experience there is basically a step process of gentrification the first wave gentrifiers are usually young artists who are generally middle income by middle i mean they are wealthier than those already living in the neighborhood but not incredibly wealthy think like income they move in because rent is cheap and they appreciate the neighborhood for what it is as young people with some expendable income move in shrewd business see an opportunity and thus trendier places like coffee shops bookstores etc open up after this happens for a while real estate agents see whats happening and build new houses or renovate old ones and rent them for a price higher than the neighborhood has seen before then the wave of gentrifiers see that the neighborhood is getting trendier and safer and they move in in droves to the new houses after this the city raises property taxes and thus rent goes up for everyone and many people can no longer afford to live there ironically the first wave gentrifiers get priced out as well so they move into another poor neighborhood and the whole process starts again there is also a racial component to all this considering that wealthier people tend to be white due to systematic racism etc so some of the long time residents get angry at white people for moving in and raising the rent some racist wave gentrifiers only feel safe moving in after the scary black people move out etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because even wealthier people already live in manhattan the only place younger people can afford is in poorer neighborhoods
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as far as i understand generally it happens because poor areas attract the artists and trendy businesses which attracts the young professionals which brings in all the money and leads to higher rent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they find the area charming or full of potential maybe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as cities growget more expensive people get pushed out from the citys core so if you have a poor neighborhood you might see rich people coming in who they themselves were pushed out by rich in their eyes people its all relative
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i guess thanks for jump starting us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youll fit right in used to be called breuckelen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people bought houses near the race track in the town next to mine then began to complain about the noise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on the plus side its fun to tell them to fuck off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its such a hot topic because its seen at good for the gentrifiers but bad for the previous occupants also i had no idea yuppy meant young urban professional
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but then you end up with slums those poor families dont disappear
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair to the yuppie im in london and we literally cant afford to live anywhere but the areas that are being gentrified a lot of it is the landlords doing places up and charging way more than its worth because theyre near public transport or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would a poor area attract trendy businesses
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i liked playing along i always act russian when playing online games too its funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yuppies come down to austin and complain of the bbq smoke too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stafford springs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are laws about how much noise private individuals can make from their residences why shouldnt people complain about arbitrarily inconsistent laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is a good point the problem isnt solved but rather the poor families are forced to move to select areas with other poor people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was actually a pretty good about how slums happen naturally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its much cheaper to buy a building in a poorer neighborhood than a rich one after its bought out they use the savings to renovate the building and the land they own a run down apartment suddenly looks pretty snazzy an old restaurant becomes a nice brunch café the locals wont go to these places because they cant afford them but it will attract yuppies since its less expensive than the alternatives theres also the appeal of the city environment this happens on the fringe areas of the poor neighborhoods then creeps in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,low rent to experiment with a business and meet the demands of the new culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,artists live in poor areas because they cant afford to live elsewhere artists create cool shit rich people show up to buy the cool shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cheap rent the artists and people that start these businesses generally dont have a lot of money think about the sort of businesses you might see run out of abandoned warehouses and garages and stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuck would you complain about that for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but barbeque smoke is the best smoke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people need to get a damn grip thats ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hell it isnt fall for me if i dont smell mesquite
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,remys taking shots bc shes got more bangs look at those spider legs on nickis forehead lmao man this just reminds me that the early was a mess for fashion in general

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im outta the loop here did someone diss nicki also what is shether ive seen that a few times
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,def dont care for nicki but that diss track was garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she has the matching spider leg eyebrows too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes taking shots because shes washed up and on the verge of being locked in a cage for the rest of her days desperate times call for desperate measures
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,remy and nicki were cool way back before remy did jail time but nickis career skyrockets during said time remy comes out of jail and she said some shit on a track that nicki took offense to nicki starts throwing subliminals at her in her two recent features one is a jason derulo song and the other is her verse in make love by gucci mane then remy drops an actual diss track called shether referencing nas diss track to jay z entitled ether nicki hasnt commented since sources say her death was instant but not painless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its stickied at the top of the sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,remy ma dissed nicki track is called shether nicki shot some subliminals in make love by gucci and shether was remys response its dope

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like the songbut i feel it will have more meaning when put in context of the album i feel like its going to be for this new album what king kunta was for tpab
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,read that as malestersmolesters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah definitely i feel like i will enjoy it more once i hear the whole album but by itself it feels alright i enjoy the beat though but i would have preferred better lyrics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what king kunta was part of the narrative you must be talking about i cause people were calling that mainstream and dumbed down before the album came out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can we just not enjoy a song without it being deep its just a nice song to vibe to it doesnt have to be a piecewhich it might be of a larger project it could be a fun little track now if it does end up like you said i dont think it adds anything holding kendrick to this standard like that will take the fun out of his music
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what im saying is it will take king kuntas place in the narrative
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that said it will fit into a bigger picture and still be a bop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh no doubt cant wait man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mods do something about this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or from hillary and her goons

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i aint stepping outta all my papers legit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,making a baby with yourself sounds more like a kanye thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes not an ugly baby at all people get upset when its pointed out that she happens to look more like her dad get over it people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf i assumed the fix your face line was meant to be a double entendre both referencing classic black mama vernacular and the people who make fun of blue ivys resemblance to her father
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuck are you talking about theres literally no one in this thread shaming folks over that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the little girl is fam and shes not even an ugly baby she scowls up like jay thats for sure but shes a good looking baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if blue ivy was as boy would she be getting these same type of reactions for how she looks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes got those jigga lips
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fix your face as in i dont like the look youre giving me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,north does look a lot more like him than kim 🤔🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need to keep reading yes there are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive seen some ugly ass kids blue ivy aint ugly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes adorable and looks like she is full of personality she has such an expressive face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean she is years old when i was years old i was a blond grey eyed kid and now i have brown hair and green eyes the genetics want to play sometimes also ive seen a lot of uglier years old girls and boys i bet shes cuter than a large part of this sub including me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she looks like jay z and hes ugly for a woman her lips nose and eyes are ctrl c ctrl v off of jay z
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she ugly as hell nothin wrong with that im sure shell develop awesome qualities that have nothing to do with her looks as she grows but damn she look dead on like jay z
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes prime example is jaden smith
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh bitch you didnt just say that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its okay to be gay here we all love chauncii
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol sure lets go with that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,north is a cutey patootie tho 🤔🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of comments mole hills out of mountains and whatever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for some reason that look on her little baby face is hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,baby bey looks like hines ward
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true but thats common to have eyehair color change with age facial features are much more representative of what someone will look like as an adult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,noone ever called jaden ugly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats actually a phrase for when youre mean muggin your parents heard it all the time from my parents growing up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow youre definitely lost on this one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kanye a cutie patootie too 🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally no one in this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slightly but pleasantly surprised
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes ugly bro let it go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol if you think people werent making fun of this face less than a year ago then you must be new here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its perfectly acceptable not to find attractive women hot meghan trainor needs a husband too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha yea we can all say what we want but we shouldnt be upset about the consequences
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerygpmosxu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess were just gonna ignore the looking like your father part
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so which four year old do you find attractive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people made fun of his dumb expression not what he look like if he didnt look confused in every damn pic hed be fine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol thats just a stupid face he makes not the same thing at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this prompted me to look her up which made me realize that before today id never seen a picture of her that wasnt photoshopped af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jay has a pretty notorious mean mug considering he was mainly in the gangsta rap sub genre
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the one that doesnt look like jay z
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this child is making an expression thats what the picture is about so essentially youre saying the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh no theyre calling her ugly because her father is jayz are people calling jaden ugly because his father is will smith
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when she makes an expression that makes her look more like jay z when jaden smith makes an expression that makes him look stupid obviously its not grade a beef but come on youre arguing for the sake of arguing not very nice from an xtremely nice redditor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obviously its not grade a beef but come on youre arguing for the sake of arguing i think thats what youre doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,again just something we can disagree on i was trying to prove a point and youre trying to argue about comparisons while evading the point move on

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this hurts to read
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cant you see when they read your message never text again before they read your message

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah i text again before she reads the message so i can pretend like oh she aint read this yet so imma make this more easy for her to reply cause im a desperate piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do yaself a favor and turn off read recepits dont double text and keep ya roster stacked so you stay busy bitches love it when u text em like once a day and actually got shit to say vs just textin on some hey what u doin nm u bullshit

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i admired the effort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sign a couple impressive udfas nigga and work on ya front office at the gym if u got a quality front office and some decent udfa u start attractin the attention of the top recruits

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,howd u get a screenshot of my messages bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its all about not only appearing like you got options but actually having options that you cultivate people approach dating like growing a flower when they should be growing crops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,read receipts just show others that you read their text it doesnt automatically show you if the other person read the imessage unless they too turned on read receipts which isnt the default i know this cuz im a petty nigga who sometimes likes letting ppl know i read their text but chose not to respond

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah kid give kimmie her props she turned a sex tape that was leaked without her knowledge into an empire now you have people itching to know her every move that doesnt happen by just being a hoe also i think we need to end the kim is a hoe narrative if being involved with different dudes makes her a hoe then people need to start calling taylor swift a hoe too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,make ends meat do you know who her father was who her stepdad was she wanted to put her name out she has no talent or skills so she sold her ass and plastered it on the net since then shes been banging talented rich black dudes while simultaneously destroying their lives or career shes a toxic hoe and only a crazy person like kanye would consider wifing someone who leaves that long a trail of tattered bodies and careers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she would have been a successful model regardless imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and she doesnt have a real job and seems like a pretty good mom so she legitimately is a housewife
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right she built an empire for herself and every one of her family members no way shes living off the residuals from that sex tape

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes a toxic hoe and only a crazy person like kanye would consider wifing someone who leaves that long a trail of tattered bodies and careers kanye aint even the first person she married
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right i originally wrote that post comparing her to an intern rising up so the metaphor is an artifact point still stands though she wanted to be famous so she did some lowlevel shit until she didnt have to money or no money infamy for her father or no no one goes around being paris hiltons extra friendentourage member and spends the rest of their time transparently jockeying for attention just cause since then shes been banging talented rich black dudes while simultaneously destroying their lives or career really whos out here letting kim kardashian destroy their career how

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the other guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but she didnt upload the tape herself and dont tell me that anybody who ever made a private sextape is a hoe lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,either way i dont think it means she cant settle down and be a good wife shittalking kardsashians for being hoes is so years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and as i said she did it once if it wasnt leaked by someone else and im suspicious of kim here and then went about her life its been a decade or something the idea that shes ruining mens lives is just hilarious these are grown ass men armenian box isnt wrecking their lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats just commercial hoeing which is significantly better than regular hoeing because you get paid and its not prostitution hoeing source i studied philosophy i know about thots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats she fucked like or people that we know of so what that dont make you a ho its really common to you know have sex with various people hoe quote of the day neckbeard quote of the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how did kim ruin their careers andor lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ray j didnt need anybodys help ruining his own career he did that by himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was but sadly it has been removed there are many methods to watch any show one chooses to if they are inquisitive enough go forth and make me proud
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dill pickle relish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow you still remember that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well not with that attitude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she poops too i dunno why its such a big deal to recognize that your parents do the same things every other human does
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what other guys ill show them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but he was in elementary school years ago and so its now his time to be edgy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deep thots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the username it checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im married and i use to work in a pharmacy i dont fuck with ratchet never have and never will and i know the statistical odds of catching many of the stds as well as the costs associated with the treatment for that vd you know all those girls and guys who people think are suspect well theyre not suspect to me i can tell you that thanks but no thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these dudes talking about how kim k cursed reggie bushs career when his best seasons statistically are the seasons after they broke up smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im blaming reggies negative yardage on her he was a great running back before she came around
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yards
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its one thing to know that your mom poops and its another whole fucked up thing to know the size weight and shape of her poops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because i dont want to think about my mom taking a shit is that so hard for you to grasp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he had already passed away before the tape was leaked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she actually sued as far as i know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his best seasons statistically are the seasons after they broke up smh best after
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except his best years in the nfl happened after they dated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if not great then at least servicable someone who can get you a few hundred yards over the course of a season kardashian voodoo is real fam 👀👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you aint gotta think about it but if she tells a story about her younger days when she had to take a shit before taking it up the ass are you gonna cry little bitch because you cant handle an adult conversation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey if youre ok with later marrying a chick whos fucked enough guys to make up a football team thats your business you might not think of her as a hoe thats fine thats your standards hell i know of guys who fucked lots of girls too then they find out that one true love of theirs shes been with maybe to guys and then they feel like theyre the hoe not worthy of the chick men can be hoes too it all depends on your standards and morals some guys dont mind being the man in line for me if im not placing at least bronze im out if that many dudes have smashed you and none of them wanted to wifey you to me thats suspect and if youre a dude just trying to smash constantly that makes you a shortsighted hoe too but again its all about your standards morals and upbringing btw in women have herpes and i wont even tell you the number of people with hpv the bad kind that gives you cancer is a little bit more complicated though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the other commenters were implying his yard season this past season was due to a kim k curse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and his worst
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we are never ever having that conversation what the hell is wrong with you

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay for real though only being able to shower at college makes you really appreciate being able to take a bath add in some alcohol to that shit and you got yourself a spa day playing some music in the background and you think youre living in the lap of luxury even if youre using dial soap and drinking keystone light
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn how short is that dudr

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is also me new years eve
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is he wearing a cap in the bath tub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new amsterdam might just be he best bang for your buck you can get a handle for here in ohio depending
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think that bottle is enough to quench your thirst 😏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see what youre trying to do winter break
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,calm down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,short enough to ride
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did we find out who he is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao my thoughts exactly but who is he ha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you right 😩 i need a bottle of hennessy and some dick and my nigga all out of hennessy 😏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get drunk and get some d 😗 wait aint that some amsterdam thats cheap right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its cheap but honestly its sleeper teir good like people dont fuck with it like goose or ciroc because its not a as popular but new am is 🔥 trust me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,around for a handle and its not the worst vodka around
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,research it and let me know lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id like mine on a human please
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,titos or deep eddys ciroc and goose are shit id prefer new am over that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh i thought cheap wont go down smooth bad i fuck with ciroc tho with apple amsterdam i cant even taste the apple and that shit strong as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ciroc is like for a tall skinny bottle but its alright all i taste is that rubbing alcohol smell and the flavor as like an aftertaste why is alcohol so weird
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mr picky over here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly forgot they made gin thats what i originally knew them for that was good too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh yes and no the more expensive it is the smoother it tends to be but also how you mix or drink it counts oz is one shot give or take so with a oz drink if you have say a ratio i use sprite of the time so shots of new am i tend to go for peach with sprite will go down fairly easy pineapple juice is a good chaser the acidity helps kill the alcohol after taste if you dont like the citric taste then mix some apple juice in there for sweetness and that shit will taste like candy i like making drinks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new amsterdam is easily the best taste per dollar ever any kind of liquor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ciroc aint a bottle lol and if you really want to see what rubbing alcohol tastes like go buy a handle of vodka once you drink a plastic handle of taaka that ciroc will taste like heaven
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too sweet will make u bot taste he booze drink waaaay too much which is good if u tryna get the hoes lit but bad if u wanna be alive at the end of the night i try to add some sour or bitter in to balance it out so a lil bit o lime plus a liquor to chaser ratio is a good mix for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh so youre supposed to mix plain alcohol with something nobody told my underage ass 😑
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,peach ciroc not a bottle damn my nigga mustve lied then 😩 he said just gimme and ill make it happen oh shit i looked online and its around is taaka the red cap i heard that shit makes your stomach hurt 💀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats like vlad or bankers club shit it gets the job done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sours fuck my stomach up im a light weight too so drinks in and im fucking going off anyway make my shit sweet fruity point me to the dance floor and find me someone snuggle with when the night is done im not even trying to smash most of the time i genuinely want to nuzzle up radiate a fuck ton of body heat on and sleep like im getting fucking paid for that shit drunk me is a simple affectionate man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish these ladies fucked with beer as much as i do would make shit so much easier
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see some people will give you shit about drinking girly drinks but i like mixed drinks so fuck em now you can drink it straight but its harder to choke down its times easier to drink when you mix it sprite ginger ale is a good go two for your clear liquids gin tequila vodka triple sec etc stuff like henny bourbon whiskey rum throw them in coke dr pepper youll be golden in no time grasshopper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao yeah he playing you ciroc is actually a great vodka hell my dad even drinks it lol i dont remember what color cap taaka has but its legit for a handle of it i drank way too much of that shit in college i never noticed any stomach pains from drinking it but people call that tier of vodka quality rot gut so im sure there is good reasoning behind it any other alcohol related questions sir chauncii
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,skinnyathleticfit hoes aint fuck with beer cus its like drinkin bread grab a handle o ruskova sneaky good for a handle some crystal light appletini packets now ur ready to get a whole gang o hoes askin omg this i soo good what did u put in this for under u can buy all the beer u want for yaself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just get yourself one of those alcoholic chicks they fucks with it all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay so like why does straight alcohol burn going down or feels hard to swallow like i know that shit in my mouth but i gotta make myself swallow it unless im taking big ass gulps i had some clear vodka in michigan when i was and it was mixed with kiwi strawberry soda and it was still hard to swallow but i wasnt tasting the actual alcohol is it a mind thing also do some people act totally different when theyre drunk i drank a half a bottle of ciroc on an empty stomach and i was lit within minutes like the feeling of being drunk hit my ass all of a sudden i couldnt even tell i was drunk cause i was going with that shit and i let the dude coerce me into letting him fuck me damn that was a fun ass time i took off my clothes and he passed me the baby oil and tried to fuck me but the condom popped times eventually he gave up and we cuddled then he asked me shit like math problems and i told him history facts and even recognized a naruto figurine on his desk even in my class a bitch was presenting fearlessly cause that alcohol helped me grow a pair 🥜 also when he was trying to put it in its like the feeling of his dick was amplified and i was moaning his name i also kinda experienced helplessness cause he said you gone suck this dick you dont have a choice and my ass did it he was playing mad at me but it felt weird cause i was under his control its not like he couldnt have easily taken advantage of me but eh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao you always talking about that crystal light and cheap vodka is it really that good for them hoes i feel like ive been missing out if so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alright my man you got some learning to do first of all never fucking use baby oil for lubeespecially with a god damn condom what the fuck were you thinking my man an oil based lube should never ever be mixed with condoms oil based lubes cause condoms to break down and become weak hence the four broken condoms you two experienced always use a water based lube when using latex condoms anyways you just spouted a ton of shit i wasnt expecting so ill tackle the alcohol thing next yes hard alcohol will burn its just what alcohol tastes like youll get more used to it the more you drink but in the meantime you can do some things to help yourself get to that point its all about how you take the shot how you chase the shot or how you mix your drink sounds like you werent drinking your liquor in the most idealefficient way so no wonder it was hard for you to swallow get a good non alcoholic drink to help you along the path to fuckedupness my girl in college loved that simply raspberry lemonade lmao couldnt even taste the vodka in it when mixed together and it was also good when taking shots the key is to shoot the shot of liquor as fast you can and then immediately take a big swig of the nonalcoholic drink of choice called a chaser chasing the vodka with the lemonade or any drink of choice will allow you to not even feel the burn or taste the alcohol yes id say pretty much everyone acts different when theyre drunk its an altered state of being intoxication isnt a joke drinking a half bottle of ciroc with no food is guaranteed to get nearly anybody feeling some type of way thats a good amount of alcohol for even the most experienced drinker when taken in a short amount of time especially on an empty stomach from the sounds of it you were genuinely fucked up i aint never done math problems and shit while drunk lol the fuck is wrong with you two as far as the sex aspect of your comment i cant really answer much about the whole dick being amplified while being in your ass thing but i can offer my thoughts about the whole power aspect of it all peep my username you were without a question being submissive to him and from the sounds of it you loved it bdsm aint no joke my man theres a reason so many people are into it including myself reading your comment you come off as someone who likes having someone take control during sex and use you how they like maybe look more into the domsub power dynamic and explore it i tried my best in responding to your explosion of a comment if it were more organized i could give a much better response but hopefully this satisfied you anything else you want to talk about you god damn bpt legend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh ive gotten top bartender compliments and not even from ignant hoes from girls that know they liquor one tine this girl perla that hated me for no good reason at all other than i talk a lotta shit cqme up to me and said omg whats in this and i lied sayin it was a homemade appletini mix she gobbled it up and was kissin my ass the rest of the night tryna get the recipe but i said it was a secret goat haus recipe reserved for the residents but we would keep it on tap for her whenever she would come thru fine af tiny pr chick too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn lemme get a pic of perla lol but for real im going to have to try this shit one of these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iran is one of germanys largest foreign tourist destination sites theyre keeping something secret from us they dont want american tourists to ruin it lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck that id like to visit iran someday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are americans who were born in iran and go back often there are also american athletes and businesses that operate there too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,funny post but its a sad situation smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wheres that persian chick that frequents these board i want to ask her if iran fucks with us black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iranian americans probably care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iran is a beautiful country and itd be an experience to go if you ever get the chance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tfw no argo sequel now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are the white people done bombing this post with serious shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean their probably not wrong to assume we would
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i might when this shitshow dies down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man persian chicks are so bad would convert to islam for that ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if its anything like the rest of the arab world they dont fucks with black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i spoke with a documentarian who was black who was doing a piece on white nationalism and how white nationalists call themselves aryans which are iranians she went to iran to see the monument of darius which calls the iranians aryans anyway i asked her if she was treated differently because she was black and she said that mostly she was just treated as a tourist there are so few black people in iran that it makes you stand out as a tourist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real theyre getting a double whammy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,posts in bpt refers to waka flocka flame as that guy and comments on his lip size pick one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair to this guy i would notice peoples lips if i didnt have any
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,while beautiful and historic i just cant in good conscience go to a theocracy ill stick with hitting up iceland every few years during the winter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i live in a blistering subtropical hell when i go on vacation i dont want to boil besides the us is big enough to never leave and still see a huge variation of culture and geography
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you have a source for that or is it just a perpetuation of the bash americans circle jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are these the best pictures you can give
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iran is special because its not like the rest of the arab world iran is shia not sunni the dominant ethnicity is not arab but persian and there is a lot of western asian influence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait so if an iranian american gets deported back to iran will iran let them in or are they gonna be stuck tom hanksing it in the airport
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the dude is a donald fan i doubt he understands
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need to get out there and see more if you really think that and have the opportunity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iran has some very popular ski resorts its a lot like spain in that for the most part it is very arid and hot but then when you go north you pass the mountains and all of a sudden it becomes temperate and can even snow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna have to stop you there but huge variation of culture a change in accent and food taste isnt a radical culture break man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nephew please stop and delete this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would if i could trust me shits expensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,us is big enough to never leave and still see a huge variation of culture and geography i cant imagine anyone saying that besides ones that really havent traveled much at all you must be getting downvoted by people that havent left the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you saying that cajun culture and and urban culture are equivalent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nephew please youre hurting the family
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its certainly not something a lot of people can afford i think its something like of americans even have a passport nevermind actually use one so just trust us isnt big enough to never leave to see a huge culture variation if you ever get the chance to to travel elsewhere do it and i dont mean europe really get out of your element if you ever get the chance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha i imagine to be fair i was expecting it i had this argument before american friends who tell me they can pretty much stay where they live and get all they need without paying attention to the rest of the world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you fly out from anywhere in america to namibia vietnam argentina slovakia pick any other continent youll see a much bigger difference than if you drive from new york to louisiana there are cultural differences for sure but huge ones gimme a break dont be surprised people call americans so self centered after theyre saying they can see pretty much everything without having to leave the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats exactly what hes saying hes wrong but thats what hes saying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,compared to the differences between bavaria and berlin hell yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for the advice i can imagine much of europe is becoming americanizedwestern culture beginning to homogenize asia or south america sounds like a nice place to go maybe korea or brazil
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i get where they are coming from if they havent left the us is roughly the size of all of europe so people think us is all it takes to see everything its just bad logic we certainly have a wide range of geology but certainly not a huge cultural variation people think a place like nyc vs the deep south and yeah that is a huge cultural variation butjust not the same as going too sayvietnam or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,geography yeah culture no still not going to find anything like iceland in the us though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saying they can see pretty much everything without having to leave the us he didnt say anything like that he said that there was a huge climate and culture variation across the us which is very true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just saying its an overstatement to treat visiting another state in the us as if youre discovering a whole new culture hell if i was some afghan sheep herder i wouldnt distinguish the difference between canada and the us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah hit up south american and asia those are my next stops central america is great as well costa rica is the shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah and im arguing its not that big theyre all in the canvas of a north american culture its when you go to some temple where people sing weird in bali that you can say youve seen huge cultural differences
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just because people havent seen the same things you have doesnt necessarily mean theyve seen less
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all im saying is if an american gets out of his country for a while hell see its much more difference than going from one state to another
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well of course and if i stand next to a squirrel i look huge but next to an elephant im small
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn this is some bluth level family savagery

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that an old pic i swear jbs hairline starts at the top of his head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no hairline more vicious than
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a megamind
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,year old white man here did you even look at that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the hairline is jacked up you want it straight and crisp for black mens hair the edges and lines are really important
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white man here i had a black friend once a black mans hairline is not something that fried back easily is always exposed because no bangs and when it gets fucked up it stays that way for some reason sort of like waxing he claimed a hairline will not reclaim lost territory very well some other things he told me black peoples bones are more dense and often dont float as well white people smell like wet dog we apparently want to inspect that noise in the dark where theyve seen that movie and dont want to die i cannot get these statements peer reviewed because i live in a very white town texas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what ipas do you recommend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bryant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im white and i definitely love wayne brady he seems like hed be fun to hang out with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like the game developers have never seen a black person cornrows are all fucked up afros are all fucked up fades are all fucked up caesars are all fucked up you have to rock a baldy and even the head shape is fucked up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wouldnt it be cuz upside down parabola idk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh it works for him he could totally go bald if he wanted to though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to me its been receding for centuries
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i want to say has him beat but theyre about the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,words steven a smith
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,year old white man here how are you guys diversifying your retirement savings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt even look bad compared to other old people haircuts if i saw him in public i wouldnt even double take
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dunno it doesnt look like the barbers fault its more like brady just has a fucked up hairline
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black people do have higher bone mineral density than whites this means that white people are more susceptible to osteoporosis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black people on average have no difference in bone density than any other race of human white people only smell like wet dog if their hair is dirty like unwashed for a period of time facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that bones thing sounds like a negro excuse for not being able to swim but all that other shit is true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably something with a ridiculously high amount of hops if your tongue can taste something that isnt bitter then you doing it wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its time to du duud uduuud uuudududuudu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes funny but not on the top of the list as far as famous black people id like to hang out with id start with snoop because he isnt a pussy bitch who only says sensible chuckle funny stuff and is a fan of pittsburgh stuff followed by dave chapelle because i think he could genuinely watch me long enough to say something funny enough to make me change a stupid behavior and end with justin bieber because he probably could get me laid just by association
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is one of the worst parts about playing white people sports games was making my character in wwe and they dont even have cornrows anymore their afros are shit the dreads are shit and theres no fades at all what the fuck kind of bullshit why remove the corn rows

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so this past black friday at work the girl im in love with came through much to my surprise and at the time i was pretty happy and content because even though my feelings were unrequited i was trying to better myself and raise my selfconfidenceesteem so i could be able to better express them for the next time that i saw her well long story short we talked for a decent minutes and i completely deteriorated from all of that progress because just seeing her made my nerves start acting up and i blanked out so now i have all of this renewed anxiety i tried so hard to get rid of and all because ive essentially convinced myself that im too much of a pussy to tell her how i feel hence happiness ruined through destructive behavior or something like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can someone please give me a link to the video this came from ive been googling all types of high black guy meme iterations to find it and still havent found shit

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hits way too close to home fam it is really warm in there though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think weve reached a singularity where bpt is getting more depressing and meirl is getting too memey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you think about it this entire sub has gone completely mental just ima nvm i cant do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,savage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone told me something similar senior year of high school to open yourself to love you have to open yourself to pain it comes with both you cant have it any other way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big mistake pain might be horrible but if you manage to work through it you will gain so much give me pride and pain any day of the week over comfort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,buddy unrequited love and selfdestructive behavior ruined my life move on if she cant see the you that the people that love you see then she cant love you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mmme too thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,part of me feels like this is the reason why a lot of guys say girls gravitate towards them when they get a girl maybe because when they already have someone they dont really act selfdestructivenervous around other girls which ultimately leaves a good impression on them fuck if i know though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea its possible to like someone too much might throw the energies astray but you cant control your nerves every second so dont sweat it theres a girl out there that fits right into your anxiety slot

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me but with gaming
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i fucking hope so man if its just an evolved eml phase well eventually grow out of then thats good news if not well fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is although its nothing new to your generation whats really new is the internet memes for previous generations it was always in the form of selfdepreciating jokes and raunchy stories of poor impulse control at this phase life takes three paths you ruin your life you grow out of it and become a well adjusted adult you become famous and option one is delayed until your fame and money runs out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as someone over uh sure yes definitely a phase
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,udarkknightx linked it up top gotchu fam i watched fuckin of these ugly ass videos boy witchyo talkin shit ass friends and all that championship ass forehead you put lettuce in a blender n drink it for breakfast thats my favorite

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was in your shoes years ago tanked a whole year away added years to my graduation date but i just graduated in spring heres how i turned my shit around talk to a counselor school should offer them for free its hard at first especially if youre not an emotionally open person but theyre good at opening you up just be honest their job is to listen and help talk to your family or friends people that care about you they care more about your wellbeing than any grades counselor can help you with the best approach for this talk to professors they want you to succeed tell them what youre going through and that youre seeking help getting a note from counselor works see if you can do any makeup work or waive a bad grade or something be honest with yourself about your situation do you need time away from school do you just not want to go to school do you have depression do you have problems focusing could find out you have adhd at theres usually a something fundamental that leads to this situation hope that helps ask any questions if you gottem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so i went to a community college back then i eventually dropped out and now im going to a different one but it depends on your situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to save your grade if you want talk to a doctor and get diagnosed with depression and then medically withdraw from school withdrawals dont lower your gpa
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can get your bad grades erased with a retroactive if you have a doctor for your depression dont give up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not actually i probably should have been more specific i dont really do drugs i can just relate to the general depression
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah yeah i went to community college but nah im good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ehhh skiing is fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if one drink gets you tripping you might have a serious medical condition
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i actually get the spins and puke easily from weed but now from alc idk whats up with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally the same as me right now only at university because im supposed to do it ive decided fuck motivation and get on the disciple train i got pretty demotivated when i realized studying isnt like grinding out shit in video games you cant just throw hours at studying and expect good grades you have to apply yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get some andy andrews in your life bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was me in hs im insanely lucky i got above a cumulative it got better for me in college i wish i could tell you how maybe because i finally realized holy fuck im training myself to be a functioning person if i dont do this im fucked forever maybe because im paying like a year and fuck if im gonna do that to sit in a room and play video games for days a year so i can go out into the world and become poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,truuu i shoulda specified i want to go to university im just not too sure as what to do in it

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont realize theyre the problem the people that dont complain about drama dont have a drama problem because they have the good sense to avoid or at least minimize problematic situations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres an old saying in tennessee — i know its in texas probably in tennessee — that says fool me once shame on — shame on you fool me — you cant get fooled again gw bush the realest nigga

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,while i can appreciate this nicole is an experienced award attendee sitting in the audience is occasionally smiling at the camera and clapping unless youre part of a bit you shouldnt wear stuff that makes you clap like a freak
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from names to numbers is the name of my next mixtape

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,profesional reposter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,op is fast eddie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slightly less shit title too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorta unrelated but you may be able to help me my wifi lets me open direct imgur links but once its an album it says no internet connection has anyone had this problem before
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah karma has no real world value or application for a noncommercial user
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,check the sub bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first to like your own shit is og shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not on instagram which is what this is referring to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly im not afraid to call people out who do this this one girl i know consistently gets between likes per photo and she still like her own posts like wtf one extra like isnt making a difference with those numbers edit fuck i get it everyone but me likes their own pics apparently sorry i have fun calling out a couple of my friends for shits and gigs once in a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do they get a notification where
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who gets a notification if you like your own photo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk if the number being even is superficial so much as obsessive personality disorder that being said i might add it to my repertoire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dingleberries
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt it feel great
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well today you can earn from that so winwin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and when theres a k letter at the end shit gets really fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah kinda i guess dunno why so many downvotes again dont care about numbers feel me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its one of those gifs where you dont see it for a long time but when you finally see it again you laugh just as hard as you did the first time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure was risky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope its cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is lou dobbs tonight on cnn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,face the nation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually a movie the aviator
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you using an app
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wonder what the numbers would look like if we could downvote in presidential elections
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,word i like my shit the most fuck yall unless you fuck with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too much pressure to stay consistent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats all me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can approve 👌
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if anyone ever called me out for liking my own pictures id laugh at them for caring
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the hell i get like likes with a pic of me from a distance and even i wouldnt do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you were running for president wouldnt you vote for yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you care enough to call someone out its their picture it aint that deep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i get like likes per photo but i still like it because every like counts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for facebook someone has pointed out that this refers to instagram though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no one not on fb not on ig
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fyi if the compulsion is not excessive time consuming and a significant interference to ones daily routinejobor relationships its not ocd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont question it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats just the beginning check this out dude i got shares of apple stock no man nowhys everything gotta be money with you facebook shares yo well thats still money and their stock is going up nicely damnit gonna find a new bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what show is this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah ok thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it in the movie cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah reddit is fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,third party would win since most people would upvote their candidate and downvote the second candidate while third party voters would upvote theirs while downvoting one of the big two candidates
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we are commenting on a ye meme after all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got called out once and i said fuck you my pics are dope even if they werent mine id still like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only follow people i know personally and only a couple of them do this i havent had any issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because theyre my friends and i think its funny why do you care if i do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually he said obsessive personality disorder which is not the same thing as ocd you can read about it imo people get irrationally worked up whenever anyone even dares to use the word obsessive in a conversation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats good to know thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,friends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,law and order
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pawn stars
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shot in the dark here but it could be reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno was an inside job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nine hundred and eleventh reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in conclusion reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,caillu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,darude sandstorm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he lied its actually toy story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tried restarting the phone or app often works i feel like ive had a similar issue before that just stopped being an issue after a while like just took a bit of time i opened them all in browser for like a day installed the imgur app for it admittedly it works way better for large albums than rif anyway so sometimes still use it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe restart the app or email the dev imgur changed some stuff a while back that blocked apps from using their api without paying so it could be that i would also recommend trying relay for reddit if you havent much better imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah reddit is fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if you could upvote or downvote once would people commit to their own candidate or take away from another
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats still not a lot of people for the party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly i like my pictures so much i decided to share it with hundreds of other people but its bad if i like it myself who gives a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is what someone who likes their own pics would say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would you have an issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i suck at pictures and my face doesnt do any justice either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing yoand i was quoting from the dsm diagnostic material no ones getting irrationally worked up here dont exaggerate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reno stand up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do they call it reno in europe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he lied its actually a lie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure that is no country for old men
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he actually said thanks to me how could people watch that see his shorts and still ask is this reno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah did that no changes at all afterwards even opening them in browser would hardly make a difference unfortunately funny thing is when im connected to another network it works perfectly so its gotta be my modem dont know what to do though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay didnt know that but i tried it while being connected to another network and it did just fine are there any changes i can do to my wifi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im quite happy with the app but its just that small part thats not working
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if no one votes for any candidates and just downvoted every other candidate do we elect the one with the least downvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not bad really but whats the point likes on instagram mean even less than karma on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i just said i did didnt i
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because the guy i replied to was saying that hell read a riot act if someone calls him out i only follow friends and when i call them out its more like a busted you weirdo thing than me actually complaining about liking their own pics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rekt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry i thought the op of the comment and the guy replying uamigomontoya were the same person i felt like it was a bit patronising of you to remind him of diagnosis criteria when he never gave you a reason to believe that he was using the term disorder facetiously as opposed to genuinely believing he might have a psychological problem since he was actually using the word to describe another persons behaviour well then i dont know that being said uamigomontoya did mention having a repertoire of similar behaviour so again he might not be as clueless about ocpd as one might assume
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiobsessive–compulsivedisorder wiki link specifies to not confuse ocd and ocpd but idk pretty sure i was drunk when commenting originally and i didnt intentionally differentiate anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,darude sandstorm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah they use the metric system they call it le reno with cheese
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the correct answer was smokey and the bandit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya can try factory resetting your router there is usually a little reset button you can press with a paper clip for a half minute and then its all the default settings might clear it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,likes arent useless popularity can be a useful tool in real life karma is useless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,neither matters less than the other because both are completely useless of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i know dawg what you said is almost too stereotypical r u making this up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because the guy i replied to was saying that hell read a riot act if someone calls him out yeah thats exactly what he said if anyone ever called me out for liking my own pictures id laugh at them for caring some riot act huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this will open your eyes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can make a career with instagram likes but is liking your own photo gonna start bringing in pay checks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what why the fuck would i make some dumb shit up like that its not some crazy story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is there any white akon too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right i didnt think of that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can also sell an instagram account with lots of followers you need likes to become popular and gain followers also many popular instagram accounts gain revenue from endorsements and advertisements i would probably say more money is to be made off instagram likes than karma on reddit but also ones more like your own wont make the difference lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i asked too he aint answerin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got a man whats your man got to do with me i got a man i aint tryin to hear that see man am i showing my age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomjxmjsykgifv
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfao my girl will always tell me stories about dudes tryna talk to her while shes out and how shell just say i have a boyfriend off the bat as her man im appreciative but as a dude whos spent a lot of his life getting curved i lowkey get a little salty like dudes tryna talk to my girl and somehow im on his side thinking damn you could have at least heard what he had to say lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys like him are why you dont allow friends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i really wanna know what the success rate of these catcalls are like when someone asks how they met shed just be like he said my ass was fatand the rest was history
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not trying to fuck your boyfriend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cannot tell you how many times ive heard that exact line damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sigh i need to vent about this i dont do the i have a boyfriend thing right away because i think its tacky if someone is nice to me i will talk to them the alcohol brings out the social butterfly in me i love indulging in deep conversations and with strangers its refreshing to hear new ideas and perspectives but im starting to realize theres no point its true no man talks to me because theyre interested in my mind im a piece of meat to them and its just a matter of manners how respectful they are about it ive been talking to one guy whom id really love to have as a friend and he knows im taken but he keeps sneaking this flirty shit and its exhausting trying to be polite about it im sad about it but ill have to shoot him down if theres anything i miss about being single is that guys would at least pretend theyre interested in what i have to say its so fucking depressing that i seem to have no value at all if im of the dating market and that i have to give up the non romantic and non sexual type of social interaction just because i have a man im no longer my own person im a part of a couple
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she hood thick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she looks like she is the host of countdown
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big l rip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meek would put future down in a mix tho future would be anyboul in that situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,positive k
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my man buys me things and he takes me out hahaha and this is new school shit to me but im
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me too because i came to post this thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sheeit i came here to post this too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at me look at mei just saved this bitch lifeim her boyfriend now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,vine gifs oh god what the fuck is happening
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,throw that bitch back in the water let him save her ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont wana hear what he had to say whats ya name whats sign say all the right things and then i creep up from behind lyrics might be wrong i might be high who knows
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my girlfriend has always avoided telling guys at bars that she has a boyfriend because it implies that she would be interested in him if she was single when in reality shes not interested in the guy regardless of her relationship status also a lot of guys quickly start pulling the oh you have a man where he at he doesnt need to know bullshit at which point she points at me standing next to her and the guy quickly apologizes and walks away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well he sure as hell isnt going to ask how to get to the turnpike or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my ex would talk to them introduce me as her boyfriend and then give them advice on how to approach other women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we all know what he was tryna say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why waste his time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow then you a little bitch grow the fuck up and be less sensitive you sound like drake you sensitive ass drake the type to feel bad a dude at the club tried to talk to his girl and she said she had a boyfriend i bet he just wanted to talk about the music
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know man it is way more of a dissapointment when youve been making out with a girl and then suddenly tells you she got a boyfriend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i read your comment and then laughed then i read it again and then laughed again i regret that i have but one upvote to give
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably works better in college when you can be trashy in public
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maaaaaannnn you wild wyd tho e but for real you gotta build up a small network of friends with significant others it makes it much easier to chat without the awkwardness of im taken youre not the problem is if youre in your mid dudes aint trying to be in long term relationships like that most of my guy friends dont see themselves in a real relationship until theyre my girl friends were all ready to go at
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,definitely understand what youre talking about and it goes ways lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,omg this speaks to me i thought i was crazy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,any place dedicated to drinking is really not the place to make friends of the opposite sex go to a library or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you not like to engage in these conversations with other women i mean whys it gotta be a dude if you feel theyre being pretentious atleast with another woman assuming shes straight you know it wont be right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,send me your number so we can talk about this some more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,go to a gay bar and get some gay guy friends but yeah it is a weird dynamic i feel like if im casually talking to a girl i have to make it really clear that im not trying to flirt with her it makes sense that this would be more of a problem for women seeing as how guys are supposed to do the chasing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh if you on get yo notebook movie watchin ass outta here with this ol waitin to exhale opening dialogue beeeeelllshit this bpt not rrelationships
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even if she was lying it means she doesnt want to talk to your ugly ass just walk away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats a good response for this i usually ask whats his name tf is wrong with you maybe leave her alone and walk away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,keep it pushing the minute she say i got a man just tell her to enjoy her day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always appreciate the classic well hes a lucky guy sorry if i bothered you you leave them alone but slip in a compliment and i personally remember these guys since they were respectful and not pushy when im single they would get first dibs lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if she wanted to fuck you she wouldnt say anything about her man real or fake instead of putting you on the spot saying youre trash fuck off she gives you an easy out saying shes currently unavailable so then you answer up with hey im a shithead that doesnt understand social cues for some reason that is what you decided to go with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when you dont know how to respond to i got a boyfriend so you ask people on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,summer lovin had me a blast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we are evolving above the need of sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive always thought vines make perfect gifs theyre short and sweet and they dont usually need context and theyre usually pretty funny even without sound theyre perfect for gifs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh this has been a thing for like years now rgifs hasnt has oc in months
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better start repenting these are the end of days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the gif part doesnt bother me but how about some subtitles fellas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,come catch this fade for misquoting big
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my name is no my sign is no my number is no you need to let it go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how dare you how can you rich homie quan the lyrics to big poppa
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ask yatchy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think telling a guy you have a boyfriend implies you would be interested if you didnt not telling him you have a man is more so a reason a guy will stick around and keep trying ive never had one guy assume i was interested but my hands were tied when i told him i had a boyfriend lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but if you flat out say youre not interested then you are either a fat bitch and who wants to get cussed out when having a fun night out or they try to persuade you that you should be interested give me a chance how do you know im not what youre looking for let me buy you a drink if you dont like people why are you out and on and on its much quicker and less personally insulting to say i have someone and am not looking to change that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if that happened to me i would find it hilarious and be legitimately thankful for the advice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm definitely works at in college at bars or parties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is solid advice op is basically lamenting that guys who approach her drunk in bars dont want to have deep platonic conversations about life looking for friendship in all the wrong places right there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know but honestly im really tired of hanging out with couples its very repetitive two of my good mates who are also my bfs best friends have girlfriends whom i like well enough but they seriously bore me our boys think that since theyre bros we should be bffs as well and thats just not how it works
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know right i picked it myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont have to be male i know plenty of fantastic intelligent females but i hate it that being in a relationship no interaction with the opposite sex
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,na na she gone get this number she either catchin the d or these hands niggas on every corner in flatbush
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all of them eww nasty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,summer lovin savin her aaass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,summer time loving dick in my ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like lizard people

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,things bill cosby never heard for alex
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,interesting because ive noticed that most guys get even more persistent when theyre told the girl had a boyfriend because they think shes lying either way single guys at bars can do some desperate and pathetic things when theyre rejected
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i was a girl id experiment with i have aids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have this network of friends with sos and i have known them for years but hanging out in couples gets really boring and repetitive tbh the worst thing is when you love your friend but dont like the so lol what i miss is that fresh breath of air when someone jumps into your life and you share views with them i had countless drunk deep conversations about life well into early hours of morning when i was single and there was nothing sexual or romantic about them and i miss that a lot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe theres a lost in translation with your male friends male friendships are completely different and may seem nonexistent in comparison to women relationships maybe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know what i meant i would consider them over other niggas consider not fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,met a girl drownin at sea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if that initial nigga moment never happened stinkmeaner wouldnt have stepped on grandads shoes the freemans would still live in woodcrest ed the and gin rummy would still be running up on niggas for the come up and i would still faithfully watch the boondocks on adult swim what a world that would be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wildblackguy and dantheunicornman appear on the street me yo dawg im sorry for misquotin biggie wildblackguy nah son that shit aint finna slide on these streets b mebruh come on its a easy mistake i mean anyone could of made it wildblackguy yeah b anyone could of made the mistske but the mistake was that you made it nigga me well fuck nigga what you finna do about it wildblackguyniggaima show you the lyrics b that way you can be well informed on how he spoke son megreat im glad we can get along and learn and love biggie one of the greatest and a nigga moment was never discovered editit didnt come out as planned
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wouldnt the police show up and start shooting anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,either we fuckinor im fuckin bill cosby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never heard cause they cant say shit all roofied with a pudding pop in their mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when theyre told the girl had a boyfriend because they think shes lying uh oh i actually dont have a bf i was lying you got me now take me to your bed why the fuck do people keep thinking this shit is how it works whether or not she has a bf is irrelevant shes not sleeping with you im not the most chivalrous guy around with women but come on man know when the battles lost
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,agreed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why not tho honestly why whats wrong with that i really dont understand and it hurts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have no problem being friends with girls hell if anything it gives me a chance to meet new people and maybe i end up hitting it off with one of her friends or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was just joking im sorry i didnt realize that a sub full of jokes couldnt take one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you give out your number to guys just incase you might be single in the future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saved her life now shes my girl to be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sad now so i guess we can blame stinkmeaner for season
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but you admit it thats good enough for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was the idea yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,waitmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish this was something every person would learn i used towear a fake engagement ring and once had a bloke point out that one ring meant i wasnt married wtf im trying to give us both an easy out here why keep pushing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because it does work lol ive gotten laid at least twice from girls with boyfriends by just being persistent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two of my best and oldest friends are girls its just not that common but it does happen heres one of them and i drunk af on my bday for proof
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shouldve made it clear you were joking otherwise you sound like an asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is yalls problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sigh no i dont i was just trying to help answer ol boys question but yall can just keep being assholes to women its cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ruined the flow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuck kind of girls are you banging because where im from whenever a girl comes out and says i have a boyfriend not just let it slip during conversationflirting thats a hard stop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont think the girls you are hooking up with know much about the concept of having a boyfriend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you secretly the version guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow she is incredible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i obviously didnt think she went out with several people at the same time i didnt think i needed to explain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,various levels of thirst
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a dude whos had a string of bad luck in my love life the past couple years desperation and jealousy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont sweat it last time i answered a question on here i got hit with a fury of downvotes there are some arseholes here that take a real damned if you do damned if you dont attitude towards women just like in real life ignore them and stick to talking with the decent ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just wanted to be cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my initial thought too lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and she got a twin 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it sounded like you were implying that she slept with all of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,levels i cant even comprehend even as someone whos been curved all year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shoulda saved tha bitch in the pool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,girls worth being with dont once you find you one of those you realise how lucky you are it helps if youre a guy who doesnt throw himself at every woman that shows attention and sticks to his girl though thats when you stop being a boy and become a man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the only truth here is that youre a judgemental sexist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,underrated title of the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre not the real mccoy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a good movie id watch it times in a row b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my auntie walked out that movie when it was in theaters lol

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hello my dear spicy enchilada oowowie you are hot is that tabasco im smelling wowzers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bad gasinducing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well youre not wrong there out of convenience while cooking it at home you would cook it in a pan then add eggs and scramble them in but if you have a grill handy they would definitely taste way better that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i pan fry slices in butter for breakfast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just mansplooshed my hepanties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,put that hot sauce on my burrito babe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont be ridiculousit was in grade
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which chorizo do you get only ones i see in publix and costco are some argentinean ones with a blue packaging and other back home i used to go to bjs and get this one pack of chorizo not sure which brand it was just a clear packaging and there was sausages in there and they were amazing on the grill
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,interesting ill have to give it another go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well im mexican and live in southern california so theres plenty of local authentic hispanic meat markets all over the place so i dont think ive ever purchased the packaged brand stuff its all fresh counterservice product the mexican chorizo is considerably spicier and kicks you in the mouth but its what im used to but i recently tried salvadorean chorizo which comes in these chubby short links and although its a zero out of ten on the spicyness scale its absolutely amazing i hate to say it but it may even be better than the mexican stuff i grew up eating if you can find authentic salvadorean chorizo dont hesitate to try it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah the one from bjs is mexican but damn that sounds good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when your bf packing heat and your girlfriend asks about him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how much do you love me jesus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every week this gets reposted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,feels like winter is cumming
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and drinking oj after brushing your teeth feel like you just gave satan head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pause
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,♪do you wanna blow a snowmaaaaaaaan♪
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when he melt in your mouth not in your hand talking about brainfreeze
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pause nigga damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seriously though if this really bugs you get a toothpaste that doesnt contain sodium lauryl sulfate its perfectly safe but it does nothing besides create that foaming lather people like and its responsible for burning off a layer of your tongue its that fresh layer that makes water burn your tonguetaste bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,free the lo god retchy p
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,freeretchyp freemymans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u should try drinking water after eating a pack of those weird peppermint chews your mouth literally feels like the inside of a freezer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sooo just eating ice 🤔🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ever get head after she just got done brushing her teeth feels like shes frosty the snowmanuhwoman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the minty water flavor is the best
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drinking right after brushing removes the fluoride and negates the benefits of brushing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes great idea petition to have a man who committed an armed robbery be freed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reading that comment then looking at that mugshot made it funnier

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuck is juice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i drank oj after brushing my teeth so much as a kid that the taste doesnt bother me anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not if you use sensodyne or another toothpaste that doesnt use sls as a foaming agent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the trick is to rinse your mouth out with warm water it dissolves the detergents in toothpaste that block the receptors on your taste buds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitchholdonjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im looking at that smug grin and im thinking this guy is definitely speaking from experience

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for those who dont know this happened right before the interchange one of the most heavily trafficed regions in atlanta fortunately my route doesnt go that way but this is gonna mess up thousands of people for the foreseeable future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boss is gonna be like you better have siri reroute if you dont wanna get written up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that must have been the ovo sweatshop in panic after hearing kendricks new track
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and for the second time this year atl catches fire only to collapse at the worst time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i blame dwight howard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the traffic tomorrow is going to be atrocious and that doesnt mean that travelers wont attempt to spill out into the surface streets and the statecounty maintained roads eeek

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that nigga is from brooklyn he only wishes he was from here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,desiigner aint even from atlanta its just where he keeps his broads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn you dont need to roast my ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i choose trap queen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who hurt you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah your tiny ass meat slid through her front tooth gap my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just curious is tap water safe to consume in the us or like parts of the us bc all you see on tv is fridges full of water bottles next to a perfectly good sink
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trash next
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its better than half empty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive been disagreed with many times on this but once the water bottle or soda can is opened has it not lost all of its value like your not going to reuse it or drink it yourself and the money you bought it with is already spent so why does it matter if the person drinks all of it or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,generally tap water is assumed filtered and safe we use water bottles a lot too though for convenience sake and for when were on the go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tap water is good but some people i knew one like this that refuse to drink from the tap some of them are worried about government control some come from an area with bad water my roommates girlfriend swore that she was above tap water
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look up flint michigian in certain areas the faucet is perfectly fine but i wouldnt take any chances
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mostly marketing at least here in canada tap water is generally safe and bottled water happens to just be repackaged tap water anyways all just marketing by water bottle companies trying to make you afraid of drinking anything but their arctic fresh product
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes municipal tap water is safe to drink in the us all municipal tap water must meet epa primary standards for drinking water treatment if you live in the countryside though you may not be on a municipal water network and instead your tap would come from your own private well this water is not treated and edit may not be safe for drinking some people dont care for the taste of tap water and buy bottled water anyways these people are ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also because tap water tastes like ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its because of the communist plot to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,municipal water sources cities counties have to release a water quality report every year this water report lists the concentrations of all kinds of different compounds such as lead chlorine disinfection byproducts such as trihalomethanes eg chloroform and also lists the epa required maximum contaminant level mcl so you know your water is within compliance if any contaminant concentration exceeds the epa regulated mcl the municipality is required to inform you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what well water is fine for drinking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get a britatype filter pitcher in your life my whole countys water tastes terrible but with the pitcher its just as good as fiji 😎
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends on where you live
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not if you live in ny new york got the best unfiltered tap water ive ever tasted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not if you live in the northeast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tap water is cancer free tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,genuinely what is wrong with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,brita filters make the water taste worse tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im down in fl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im kinda curious as to why that picture of a kid licking a doorknob was actually taken

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,phone sales is a very high stress environment and depending on what youre selling youll get yelled at a lot its got one of the absolute highest turnover rates in any industry afaik
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least you leave your comments up when they take ls its corny when people delete their own comments when they catch downvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre welcome
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,phone sales aint nothing to door to door sales though slamming doors slamming doors everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh yeah you gotta be patient cause theres always gonna be that one person who tries you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you getting points on the sales tho is the percentage good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,internet points arent important context is how it gonna look on my record when a bunch o niggas talkin shit bout me and nobody know why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think the girl in op did it to show off it just happened that the photo was taken from that angle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe she wanted to show how much her nails have grown since she got them done but the pointer finger nail broke so she didnt want to include it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck more power to you if youre doing door to door sales
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this your current job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,patience extends to more than just phone calls if its hourly versus commission if youre commission doesnt outweigh your hourly youre getting base pay phone sales can range from an hour base better hope its a good base
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont just accidentally hide your index finger in a picture showing off your nails
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no power to you if youre doing door to door sales get the fuck off my property
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah when i was younger i was door to door for att uverse it was garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but i only got commissioned with no base but one sale was like hundred dollars but if you not making sales and no basebruh

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont forget the sex without consent who doesnt love that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people have their fantasies no matter how fucked up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets be real shes wearing a wig makeup and a ton of plastic and im not talking about the queen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i worked with walter jones once the first black power ranger zack taylor and hes in his late yet looks years younger i asked what his secret was and he told me cocoa butter and positivity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with the difference that the queen of england had no plastic surgeries done on her and that makes a huge difference this aside its true black women age slower than most
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,although true this is a fairly flattering picture of cicely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the queen has looked fucking years old since the tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some black magic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets be really real for a minute one of these people has run a country for the majority of her life look at obama his shit cracked more than garras sand defense against rock lee edit for everyones knowledge the queen has power over literally everything from the church of england to parliament she can basically veto overhaul and implement whatever she wants its rarely done though but if you think the queenking of england is powerless then you also think meek mill beat drake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiperfidiousalbion indeed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black dont ever crack thats not what downtown las vegas said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair the queen was born old
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black dont crack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people who say black doesnt crack should meet my aunts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she da real blackula
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black lives forever lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck the old ass queen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cecile tyson looked in fried green tomatoes years ago

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh i thougt you mean the football player walter jones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,will he cameo in the film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,being black natures sunscreen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that and i feel like being the mother fuckin queen miiiiight age you a bit have you seen the difference in obama from the beginning of his presidency vs the end thats only she has been queen for like years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah asian women do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uhno they dont they age at the same rate as everyone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes hasnt had any work done that white lady just aged bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,upvote for the naruto reference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the queen has power over literally everything from the church of england to parliament technically yes the queen is supreme governor of the church of england and as sovereign parliament sits in her name and by her authority but i think youll find that the house of commons and the general synod are supreme in their respective areas of legislation the queen has no power over them at all it would be constitutionally absurd if she attempted to exercise any she can basically veto overhaul and implement whatever she wants no she cant the queen cannot initiate legislation nor can she revise it parliament alone does that she can veto legislation by refusing to give assent its rarely done though its literally never done it hasnt been done for three hundred years thered be public outrage if the queen attempted to interfere with legislation in that way and again it would be constitutionally absurd as far as the law goes in this country the queen is basically a rubber stamp no more no less
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hathe queen runs a country precious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol thats not how it works she doesnt even run her house
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair the queen looks like every other year old
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for everyones knowledge the queen has power over literally everything from the church of england to parliament she can basically veto overhaul and implement whatever she wants this hasnt been true since basically and definitely not for over a century the queen cannot veto shit or do anything without the assent of elected parliament and if she tried to do so so i guess what im saying is that meek mill is a master and drake should bow down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the queen doesnt run the country and drake totally won btw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yall deluded she may not be running things on day to day basics but she is definitely not a puppet to parade around on national holidays she has worked more in her life than any of yall ever will
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i could give shits about some old lady but what makes you think meek won
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like a harry potter book
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,disrespectful mane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god save the queen you rowdy colonial
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you mean the queen looks years older
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo son is that the guy who makes tea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit that guy is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao him on the ali g show cracks me up so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude might be but the mustache game weak as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he looks like hes his own wax museum figurine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i still have personal contact with him so i will
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit i knew he was old but nearly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant tell you that there will be some cameos though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too bad it doesnt repel cops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jealous much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whatever helps you sleep at night
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh her weave looks like some gradea chinese import polymer shit her nose looks like michael jackson and her cheeks look like a clearcut botox work either youre straight up blind or her grandson or something also the white lady aged hard because shes the queen of fucking england obama aged a lot just by doing two terms in presidency imagine decades worth of being the queen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that white lady you mean the queen of britain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is everyone psychoanalyzing a joke post though these niggas getting deep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but then what would be the point of having a queen if not to rule in entirety the only other thing that comes to mind is the patriotic significance love for the country and its roots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,running a country is easy you just wave at parades and get your face on all the money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea he was good friends wit arnold palmer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,soup mixes too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey walter long time no see hey man i just wanted to let you know that says hello bye my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black skin catnip for police
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every time i see this i feel like i should be angry but thats my mother and grandmother on the right so i guess you win again stereotype
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn that was so accurate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right whether or not one race visibly ages more than another is really tying up my brain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a wig not weave and no not all black people are related you fucking racist anyway the queen of england has no real responsibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes actually the queen of uk of great britain and northern island and other commonwealth realms queen of britain implies shes the queen of britain entire and only britain the country of great britain is part of the uk but lesser britain fuck it just the queen will do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she dont mean shit to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure you summed it up the op up at the top of this comment chain is the holy shit wtf are you saying type of wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not personally a fan but people would argue that its beneficial for symbolism it means you have an apolitical head of state whos a figurehead and isnt responsible for running the government plus you get a consistent ambassador type person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same reason that other european countries have presidents not quite the same as the potus — to give effect to laws appoint the head of the government to open and close parliament etc the queen is the head of state and as such is a national figurehead and source of national identity for us all as well as being the focal point of the patriotichistorical significance of the monarchy besides which the royal family remains pretty popular here mainly because of the queen i think so unless public opinion changes massively the monarchy isnt going anywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always view it as she aint hurting us people visit to go see the palace and itd be too awkwardtoo much of a hassleyo get rid of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ask that nigga if he can bring the price down on them gallon green teas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip arnold palmer just found out he died about a month ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see no problem with this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,copnip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit im angry because im not aging like this im agingl ike a fucking white woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,year long menopause
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and no not all black people are related you fucking racist dont tell me you actually took that one seriously lmao bruh this is rblackpeopletwitter and you take jokes seriously youre out of your place boy joke suppose to be funi so dis ain no jok well ofc if you dont go tryhard on reddit maybe you find the fun in things comeon man dont take it personal i dont intend to look for some internet putthemdeucesup shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but i figured britain was close enough whilst still clarifying because lots of countries still have queens but theres only one for this weird cold place however its classified
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the queen and the tabloid darlings william and kate keep the royal family popular and this might be my own confirmation bias but the more buggered the government gets the more loved the queen is like the queen mum in the blitz according to people ive talked to theres something comforting about knowing there is this stable presence overseeing it all even if she isnt doing much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the price is on the can tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga too rich for u
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ever try that red diamond
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mans a drink mogul
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kardashian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh man its been forever since i last watched scrubs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you get called out and now its a joke gtfo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was just winding you up people usually know what you mean by britain but uk is probably the broadest term whilst still being accurate still you didnt say england so thats right enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must be unaware of the struggle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sure he has plenty of hobbies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well of course i genuinely thought you were her grandson lmao you too woke for your own sake my man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u obviously gonna need of them so thats plus tax it ends up being somehow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,negro please i been so broke i lost weight cus i couldnt eat im just sayin they aint particularly expensive if u thay broke grab some kool aid or crystal light packets the cocktail ones make some pretty kickass mixers hoes will drink cheap vodka all day long as its mixed with crystal light appletini
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that aint even that broke we all had sleep for dinner most nights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ehhh they already seem to be over you this is like telling a girl shes ugly after she rejects you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do people like getting good morning texts from anyone thats not already a so its so clingyand im a guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sometimes i text goodmorning and she tells me to stop yelling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they say if you get a light skin girl to reply to your text within minutes youre automatically granted a bachelors degree in communications
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i went on a second date with this girl from work and i thought it went well conversation always flowed nothing was forced but the next day she asked how work was and i told her about it and then i got an ooo in response 🙄🙄🙄
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,light skin girls really get too much attention dont they
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why i dont give out my number anymore when i go out i dont want to have to feign interest to some guy that i danced with for minutes and only saw half of his face i feel bad for doing this but its better for both parties because i didnt come here to find love in this club
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so whats youre describing is my entire lifesworth of interactions with girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont mind a good morning text by anyone if its followed by a wake and bake invitation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to do this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmaooo niggas out here sending goodmorning texts like its or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or after you nut
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how you do bitch you ugly af weave look like you got fleas or some shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its cute when its headed down that road and youre already on text every day basis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only time i dont mind a good morning text is when theyre a dime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this guy once was hitting me up on facebook and at first i was being nice talking back and stuff about random things then he asked me for my number and if i was talking romantically to someone and i said i was and couldnt give him my number then he said just give it to me anyway so i can text you good morning and stuff i blocked him im sorry but i dont need good morning texts from someone i dont know i added him because we had quite a few mutual friends in hindsight maybe instead of just blocking him i could have told him the reasoning but this was a while ago and i was pretty annoyed at someone asking for my number after i told him i couldnt give it away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good morning texts just seem like the most obnoxious cringey thing if theres not already a previous understanding that both parties are interested
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i do it every blue moon if were not together daily texts with no commitment is a potential recipe for hurt feelings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to get them from my friend a d were both guys so i got used to it it was weird at first tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean im not anymore so i dont have a one track mind of only this cute person can text me or tell me good morning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whenever im talking to anyone in the mornings ill say morning not because im trying to get in their pants but just because its morning and im talking to them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even from an so a daily good morning text is annoying to me if its a once in a while thing then its not so bad like if you know i have to get up extra early sending me something to make me smile is sweet other than that i prefer people text me only when they have something to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,women seem to like getting gm texts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly dont think they mind it most of my friends are girls and i text some of them good morning on a semiregular basis but i always get enthusiastic responses or some real conversation out of it i dont understand the concept of that being considered creepy unless youre just blatantly trying to be a sleaze or get in their pants or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i could see it every now and then and where it leads into a conversation not daily good mornings and thats the extent of the convo though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,am girl hate this especially when its an every day thing its just an empty conversation starter on par with how was your day text me when you actually have something to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its weird as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too damn early for all that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big if true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats actually just helpful info cut to the chase
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then whyd you give me your number
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey man if she texted you first about work thats definitely a good sign
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was a test my man she just wanted the validation and proof you were for real at the same time theres value in demonstrating u dont play that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know what its like in the us but in african countries girls are bleaching their skin much more anyway ive found that attractive women get way too much attention anyway regardless of their skin color as a guy you have to keep up with the competition if you want a beautiful girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my country i think its simply because there are less in the datingpool not just the lightskinned girls although there a plenty living here you hardly see them in clubs or bars apps like tinder are even less so there are less of them available so the ones who are get the attention from guys who are into lightdark skinned girls and from the guys who dont give a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao i know right these niggas out here being decent polite human beings who want a healthy relationship like wtf nigga are you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people who do that shit dont take no for an answer anyway he would have still texted you good morning even you ask him not to then started talking some shit about how you just so beautiful he couldnt help himself pre emptive block these motherfuckers so they learn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then he said just give it to me anyway so i can text you good morning and stuff you know those dick pics were already pulled up on his phone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm have hurt feelings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my best friend and i just send each other the weirdest shit we found on the internet on any given morning its basically a good morning text
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you do but on a smaller scale we all do its human nature to only want desirable people to talk to us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is morning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i said clingy not creepy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i would start to engage physically after demonstrating value
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gator dont play that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im so lazy tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah the skin bleaching thing is really common in the phillipines too just makes you wonder what the side effects are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh in jamaica especially a lot of our famous singers in this country are bleaching and its not even uncommon to spot at least kids bleaching at schools its so depressing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,keep up with the competition so i have virtually no chance then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good morning damn our relationship is health af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is it healthy to feel the need to respond to good morning text youre bfgf sends you every morning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have a group chat amongst my close friends that operates this way youve just inspired me to awkwardly say good morning everyday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good morningwood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my best friend and i spend the first hour of every morning bitching to each other about our jobs lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its is it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcombibzzkdjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel the need to respond to just about any text i get that isnt from a computer seems rude not to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is it healthy to want to talk to your so every morning bruh i mourn for your relationships
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do it at like every morning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good morning mofos
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i message my friend when im stuck in traffic every morning like i cant believe im wasting my life on this bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wonder why people think this makes them look better
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id go insane getting gm texts every morning from my so once in a while is fine of course but my main comment was about people not in relationships which is why i said its clingy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga i dont feel the need to talk to anybody every morning i used to send good morning texts just cause i felt like i had to not cause i wanted to edit okay fuck me for showing affection in different ways i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and send one message for every person in the group chat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now youve inspired me too pm you good morning and good night everyday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even reading that hurt my soul
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you just havent found the person that incites that need
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess id say that im just that kind of person but imma take your word for it

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u should have said fuck u and flashed your titties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its important but i think the red green and yellow properties are worth more utilities and railroads arent worth shit really
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the most important properties are the light blue and orange just before jail and free parking with the pink and red just after jailparking in second place the two places people wind up more than anywhere else are go and jail and theres chance theyll roll a or and a chance theyll roll or you dont want to maximize profits from them landing on one specific property you want to maximize the chance of them landing on any of your properties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,naw man you gotta get the properties on the corner near free parking that way when people get out of jail theyre most likely to land on one of your properties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you buy all of the cheapest properties i dont know what they are in america and put as many houses as possible on them but no hotels so no one else can progress and then will as everyone hates you and never plays with you again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get dat boi 😂😂😂😂😂😂😍😂😂😂😂😂😨😂😂😂😡😡😡😡😡😡😂😂😂😂😂😊😨😨😨😨😂😂😂😂😡😡😡😡😂😂😂

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres like three memes in this comment alone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol and give him the pleasure of seeing these acups i think not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i recognize your username from cringepics but havent seen you comment in a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have no problem with realistic career goals but video games can be competitive in every sense of the word your comment sounded like thats what it was disputing but i can see how i may have misinterpreted it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it doesnt spot the casuals reeeeee
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never ever never ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dae le christians current year have a lot of sex and dont feel bad in fact you should have sex with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how could he not pay attention to a dragoness yall spit fire and have wings so eater you can spit or are hot and fly af he missed out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i comment on a lot of random stuff mostly being sarcastic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont have anything against competitive gaming its just that when youre from a poor family you dont have time for shit thats not gonna guarantee you a win in life people in the the gaming scene has some cushion to fall back on and my brother sure didnt have any and the fact that extreme competitiveness was stressing him out at that age was enough reason for my dad to tell him to chill the fuck out video games imo should make you feel good when it stresses you out then why play it life is already hard why add another shit to the list that would make you feel down man im fucking old
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats why you dont even think about touching the b button with lil mac unless youre going for the ko punch

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya i know its based on body weight and i was super scrawny in college still am but not quite to the same extent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never heard about it being about weight most places i know pay based on how busy it usually is big cities i hear pay a lot more

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this used to be me but im trying to make changes so i met this girl in the club this week we went back to her place and do what adults do at am and theres henny in their systems we had a good time but after staying over and hanging out with her in the morning i could just tell we were on different wavelengths i walk out the door thinking meh im probably not gonna go out of my way to talk to her again shes texts me a couple hours later saying hey you left your charger shes tries to get me to swing through that night to come get it but i just said ill come get it monday i roll over monday she opens the door in dick appointment clothes and im really not about it i just grab my charger and dip i wanted to say something but just didnt have the heart and figure ill just not talk to her again she texts me after i left saying so whats up you seemed a little off i tell her nah i just had something to get off my chest nothing bad but i should have said it in person shes says i can come back so i roll over there and talked to her i basically said that i had a great time the other night and that shes great but that im not in the position emotionally to be intimate with someone right now im just not in a great place and that i just wanted to be clear with her and say it in person instead of just leaving her hanging wondering what happened she thanked me for my honesty and gave me a goodbye hug she even texted a little while later saying she really appreciated that i talked to her in person and that it was refreshing to see someone communicate and be responsible just saying that i understand where this post is coming from ive been there before trust me lol but were all humans and its rude to just switch up on someone and not communicate with them and then we wonder why all these girls out here arent loyal or have trust issues just saying talk to people and let them know where youre at
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are high key a lot of mofos on this sub that wishes this was how they operated but instead theyre stuck trying to work up the courage to be direct and forward with girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmaaaaoooooo 👌🏼
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just tryna make a change
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that made me happy some people are still decent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on behalf of women thank you for being honest with this female she will respect you for it too i hate it when men did that to me just be straight up with me also with a lot of guys i just went to hang out and told them i wasnt really down to get down and they literally pull my pants down anyways thays not cool me saying no isnt playful banter i mean that shit and not listening to me shows you dont respect me or what i say i hate that if youre just tryna fuck just say so chances are i might be too if not well we both saved some time didnt we
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,relevant flair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my ex just did this we were definitely into each other for two months but when i tried to define the relationship i think he realized im a girl you want long term with and he wasnt ready for it he manned up and talked to me told me that he wants to be friends and hang out in the crew still and maybe something will happen again in the future he coulda stayed with me to keep getting it in but he didnt want to fuck me over and we left things on a good note i respect not wanting a long term relationship yet not gonna lie im bummed but its life and at least were cool with each other and i know hes a man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my homeboys is a major hoe i feel bad for the girls especially since they think it might work out long term
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here i was about do make a me after im done lincoln this dick in that ass comment you have to bring this empathetic shit to the comment section and kill the clowning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for that you did the right thing im still a virgin and im at the point where im tired of dating because of all the bullshit yknow fucking sucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good for you man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats why i make it a point to never let my intentions be unclear if i just want to fuck you every once in a while or just someone to converse with you have to let them know from day one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre a good guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you took your phone charger to the club
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i screenshot this going to use it in the future well said btw thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly man that definitely wasnt all her fault even if you never told her that you wanted to be more than friends if you fuck a girl and just ghost on her youre probably gonna end up seeing her worst side being ambiguous and not defining the relationship is what leads to crazy situations like this i guess you risk not fucking her if youre honest about the fact that youre really just in it to bang especially if you only wanna fuck her once but if you do that and the girls know exactly where they stand then you pretty much avoid situations like yours
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck everything about that situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,user name checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you got a link to that thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i totally get where youre coming from but as a man my advice is that if you dont wanna get down then dont offer to be alone in private with them its shitty but its just the truth of how men think if you come over or i go to where youre at and were gonna be alone than im assuming sex is on the table and even if you said its not on the table were thinking its at least in the room i just want to give you some perspective of a thirsty guy because ive been there as guys we spend a lot of our time trying to get at different women with an incredibly abysmal success rate like a decent success rate for guys is getting maybe women they talk too its a lot of time and effort its time spent getting curved its time spent having unanswered messages its time making plans just to get flaked on so when a girl finally agrees to hang out on were hype like bam its happeneing were getting laid then as we head over you send a text saying hey just so u know im not trying to hook up youre trying to communicate boundaries which is great but while we hear you we dont really hear you like i said were thirsty so were going to try our hardest to make it happen so we show up youve tried to look unattractive but we really couldnt give less of a fuck were here to make this work so while youve said no to us youve just said not yet and were trying to get you there i mean clearly were both attracted to each other or we wouldnt be here and if you didnt want to you would have just curved like the other girls right its shitty but this is the thought process for men when it comes to sex this leads to guys doing what i call characters were literally just trying to be who you want us to be so that youll fuck us maybe we try being super nice maybe we try being an asshole maybe we try being ultra aggressive cuz we know that some girls are into that for all this guy knows you have a rape fantasy and just wanna see how you say no before you say yes and i know that sounds absolutely fucking crazy but in the heat of the moment all youre thinking is why isnt she fucking me and what can i do to get her to and even though youre saying no isnt playful banter for you it is for some girls and that comes into account when were playing these characters most dudes arent just going to bluntly say theyre trying to fuck because its too offputting for most girls us asking you to hang out alone is our way of asking if youre trying to without asking if youre trying to so to us when you say you do wanna hang out but then say sex isnt on the table were gonna take it as banter because why would we waste each others time like that why would we be two adults who are attracted to each other alone together not fucking it sounds kind of dumb to us so thats how guys see it so with that perspective in mind id like you to consider next time what youre agreeing to vs what he thinks youre agreeing to men and women just communicate and think differently we always have if you wanna hang out and dont wanna do anything ask to hang out in a public place just say sure where do you wanna meet up or cool where did you wanna go and you basically force his hand to chose somewhere to go if he says well i thought we could just chill at my place just tell him i think youre great but im not comfortable with that quite yet can we meet somewhere instead at that point its clear to him that you really dont wanna do anything physical but also important is that youve not put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation also youve basically set up the idea that when you do chose to hang out alone youre completely down with getting intimate those are just some tips i have for keeping yourself safe as well as getting through the very dense male skull when its thinking sexually
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is because your wife got game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is no one would go through that much trouble writing that to just lie about something so unimportant like that this dude just had to get something off his chest true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your flair says it all man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,great post
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your whole thing with implications just screams to the ambiguity of this maybe she really liked you and thought that when you made the move it was the start of something big and idk how you could say you were friends if you were literally only in it for sex my general point is that as guys were prone to lead girls on to get the sex we want and leave things ambiguous so we have plausible deniability and then just write girls off as being crazy without admitting that thats an objectively shitty thing to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a tiger tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seriously wtf is the mindset behind waking up and deciding to put this on to step outside your front door with a huge ass tiger painted on your rather substantial ass fuck it i applaud the audacity

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,success is the best revenge after all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she is probably the kind of person who corrects her name from miss to doctor when the dmv lady calls her up to the counter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lololol blocking everyone who put her on blast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am trying to get in the phd program at fsu right now i told my friends to never call me doctor because of a random doctorate my grandfather would get mad in the nursing home when the nurses wouldnt call him dr s because of his chemistry phd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its still a fuckin good clapback idgaf what her educational history is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmaoo fucking kelly kapoor lookin hoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she put a filter on or does she work on venus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😂😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont show this to rtrollxchromosomes theyve been living vicariously through this picture since it surfaced anything to take their minds off their psych degree and pizzanetflix
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a guy in my program said i dont like the girls here they get into law and start thinking they dont need men didnt even know how to respond to that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must know her you must go to school with her whats your phd in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i bet youre one of those unless its a stem degree its not real mfs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck i would too thats years and probably close to i want people to get the title right

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wanna know how i know u get no ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats raw dude thats a really dumb fucking stereotypegeneralization oh these women like to be proud of women they must have a bullshit degree from a liberal arts school and not have a job

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im about to graduate with a bachelors in nursing i have no clue what a stem degree is to be honest lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but how would the lady at the dmv know that and by correcting her what would she have achieved that will better her dmv interaction for either party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i believe in both of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are more fsu people here than i thought
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apparently i look like jay z
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,calling yourself a doctor without being a medical doctor is very pretentious mds dont go by the title dr because they earned a doctorate but because their profession is a doctor if you earn a doctorate and insist on others using the dr prefix with you everyone will think youre a prick including people with non medical doctorates this excludes professors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are some great ladies in here got to appreciate independent women also the mods switched up a comment i made about the arab in me wants to be known im arab but now people think theirs an arab in me 🤗 edit do you have some arab in you want some foreign pick up lines specify nationality
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at your service now i work as a customer service manager at guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she doesnt know that thats why you correct her and tell her it increases your positive interaction because then she can call you the correct name if someone was calling me x and my name was y i would correct them its not malicious its just what you do i want to call people by the right nametitle i want to be called by the right nametitle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nole nation baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i take back what i said about you being a dick didnt know youre my fellow brown ppl ✊🏾

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ever since kendricks verse on control which was kdot calling out all of the good rappers at the time a back and forth subliminal battle has ensued between kendrick and sean more so from big seans end listen to no more interviews as of late it seems that kendrick isnt with the subliminal shots and is firing back with more subliminal shots so we the fans are left to decipher who hes talking about although on his newest song humble i dont think he was going at big sean but the internet loves to reach whenever it can
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but then why did they allow to both be put on a dj khaled track holy key i honestly think this is more about drake

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpwwwconsumerfinancegovpolicycomplianceenforcementactionscorinthiancolleges for the lazy the bureau sued forprofit college chain corinthian colleges inc for its illegal predatory lending scheme the bureau alleges that corinthian lured tens of thousands of students to take out private loans to cover expensive tuition costs by advertising bogus job prospects and career services corinthian then used illegal debt collection tactics to strongarm students into paying back those loans while still in school at the request of the cfpb a federal court entered a final default judgment against corinthian colleges inc resolving a lawsuit filed by the cfpb in september the court ordered that corinthian was liable for more than million and prohibited the company from engaging in future misconduct edit httpwwwconsumerfinancegovaboutusnewsroomcfpbsuesforprofitcorinthiancollegesforpredatorylendingscheme for the lazy and keep in mind im quoting directly from the governments website lured into loans by lies most students who attend everest heald and wyotech schools come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds and many are the first in their families to seek an education beyond a high school diploma according to internal corinthian documents most students lived in households with very low income todays lawsuit alleges that the schools owned by corinthian colleges inc advertised their education as a gateway to good jobs and better careers it alleges that throughout the corinthian schools consumers were lured into loans by lies including sham job placement rates the cfpb alleges that corinthians school representatives led students to think that when they graduated they were likely to land good jobs and sufficient salaries to repay their private student loans but the cfpb believes that corinthian inflated the job placement rates at its schools based on its investigation the cfpb alleges that this included creating fictitious employers and reporting students as being placed at those fake employers oneday long career according to the cfpbs investigation corinthian schools told students they would have promising career options with an everest heald or wyotech degree but corinthian counted a career as a job that merely lasted one day with the promise of a second day pay for placement the cfpb also alleges that the corinthian schools further inflated advertised job placement rates by paying employers to temporarily hire graduates the schools did not inform students about these payments or that these jobs were temporary craigslist career counseling according to the cfpbs investigation the corinthian schools promised students extensive and lasting career services that were not delivered students often had trouble contacting anyone in the career services office or getting any meaningful support the limited career services included distributing generally available job postings from websites like craigslist predatory loans tuition and fees for some corinthian programs were more than five times the cost of similar programs at public colleges in the corinthian tuition and fees for an associates degree was to the tuition and fees for a bachelors degree at corinthian cost to interest rates were more than twice as expensive loans were likely to fail strongarmed by illegal debt collection tactics pulling students out of class putting education in jeopardy according to the cfpbs investigation the corinthian colleges jeopardized students academic experience by denying them education until they paid up they blocked students access to school computer terminals and other academic resources the corinthian schools also prevented students from attending and registering for class and from receiving their books for their next classes withholding diplomas the cfpb has been coming down hard in forprofit colleges over the last few years because of this so please be cautious when enrolling into these types of schools

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,condescending mfing commercial
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i had cable id rather watch the fifth element on tv edited for boobs and swearing with commercial breaks than get off my ass and put the dvd in i think its because putting a dvd or netflix on represents a choice and if you dont like whats on its your fault for choosing wrong but if you watch hours of springer followed by hours of cops youre just watching tv its not your fault theres nothing better on or at least thats what your brain thinks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ye and trump quit playing and face the truth

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ultralight beam is better than anything ye and jay have collaborated on fite me irl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jayz doesnt claim it though does he i honestly never thought they were really close as friends outside of business plus ive never been the type to kick it with my boys after they wife up annoying chicks just isnt my idea of a stressless time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aint no predicament sheep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,real friends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also forgot to mention what probably strained the friendship the whole tidalapple music thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao why would he visit him after kim got robbed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the track was was pop style according to drake thats not what happened but thats what most believe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well considering the downvotes youre right on the money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats after the beef started before the election and when kim got robbed kanye donated and supported hillary
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not like beyonce needs money lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean there are wealthier people that are better looking than him either way reminds me i need to get rich asap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes worth million and hes worth million if i was a gold digger and looked like her id be aiming a hell of a lot higher than better than i got
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone can look unattractive in the right setting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is even more astonishing that two women found him attractive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no he cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,batman bitches robins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gears of war bitches jacked up with thighs that could crush a locust drones head i think im feeling some higher education
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey ill trim your armor for

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,internet points are cool but id rather get a brick a mask a hunned guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow he looks way older than that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes also lamar from gta v
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes also part of a big buzzfeedesque youtube channel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he towers over everyone else in black jesus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,many students have flunked out of their local cc they have no idea how easy it can be to get reinstated these schools prey on the poorly educated and weak willed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ultralight beam is better than lucifer do opinions get wronger lads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cough monster cough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well obviously ye thought they were closer then that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like beyonce is the annoying one out of her and kim kim just projects it on screen but im sure shes chill off screen beyonce is probably really anal about a shit ton of things
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how many of us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how many of us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too bad theyre both kinda trash services
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,real friends smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes why would he visit his friend after their wife was attacked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drake said he didnt like the verse before kanye revealed it was because of jay it seemed like drake was actually trying to stay out of it and not bring media attention to kanyes personal stuff and taking the heat for cutting the verse very respectful move of him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre downvoting because hes wrong the beef started way before kanye made any of those comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol shes worth million she doesnt need his money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still its the social status that comes with money not the money itself most people couldnt dream of marrying beyonce because they wont ever meet her as equals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbh we dont know what her situation looked like when she first took that leap of faith and went solo it would have made sense to hook up with the newly crowned ceo and aspiring mogul
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure the song no scrubs covers this issue shes not a gold digger but hes got to keep up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant look like that even if i tried hardest in the right setting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we are robin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude he just wrote it wrong its supposed to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh fuck i got some catching up to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt even mention heart of the city
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jay on monster was horrible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomcypiizopng
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah that wouldnt be the worst decision hes ever made lol edit please prove me wrong ive been a fan of his since i know what im talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,beyoncé is notoriously psychotic to the point of having a fucking server at home with all her media appearances and every photo shes ever been in curating her image to a pretty creepy level kim is just dumb but a sweetheart shes harmless stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,careful the beyhive will fuck you up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt apple music have the largest catalogue of all the streaming services not shilling for am i use spotify but i wouldnt qualify am as a trash service
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apple music is trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apple music is the goat tidal sucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bro when you get older you call or send a card those dudes both have busy ass schedules and are probably not even in the same area code most of the time yall act like he was supposed to go see him in his dorm room or some shit if it was a lifelong friend it might be one thing but just bc they did a feature and some promos together yall assume theyre butt buddies smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they arent friends tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but its obviously a joke people are taking him way too seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people always blame their lack of game on things they dont have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no scrubs was tlc bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you probably look like that in your best setting seriously anyone can look as bad or worse than that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bumbadumdumdumdumdum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,woosh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt even mention encore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not a fan of jays line but i fucking love the song
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know his line is silly but just based on how most of mbdtf was written he probably helped with other parts of the song too i just like the song as a whole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont end up that rich have multiple successful business ventures unless youre smart or suck dick on camera
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people dont understand that yeah kim had the sex tape but she took that and made an empire out of it thats not dumb luck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the beyhive aint got shit on me ye stan since birth ill die for my king
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure jayz of all people can afford to take the time to be with someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe for your fake friends real friends make time for their real friends regardless how old send a fucking card if i got a card from one of my friends itd be worse than if they never called thats saying i dont want to make time for you so heres a little token to keep up the illusion of caring
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean i dont have charisma or a job so that seems pretty fair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what i get for relying on foggy recollection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,speaking from experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes whoosh indeed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just messing with you monster is my favorite off mbdtf actually
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes smart but also sometimes a real dummy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a famous dick thats the key
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats handy cause theyll kill for their queen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your loyalty is inspiring
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ofwgkta right guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was when it first started but its apple theyve dominated music for like the past decade of course theyd get their catalog up quick i think the main thing people dont like is that you have to be a paid subscriber to get any of it at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure he would if the person meant that much to him yall are the ones assuming theyre best friends bc theyve worked together and had their picture taken together you dont know shit about their personal relationship so stop pretending to lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sometimes circumstances dont allow for people to drop everything and rush to the side of every single person theyve ever met why dont you think how many people jay fucking z knows and ask yourself how he prioritizes relationships when he has literally hundreds if not thousands of people constantly competing for his attention its easy when you got your immediate family and all of your friends all in your little podunk town
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you got a big dick thats enough for some people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol do you think she was just standing there like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow you really got him there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arent we all tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its so cheap though i split a family membership with my girlfriend and buddy and its each i used to spend on a physical album at least once a month so listening to anything i want to at any time for is unbelievable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre been close friends for a decade and a half they recently have drifted apart i wish i knew them but im not a rap star
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wasnt talking about jay z and honestly i dont know much about him and kanyes relationship but i do know that the thing about being as rich as jay z is that he can do whatever the fuck he wants he could have people lined up with meetings and shit and he could drop them in an instant if he chose whats gonna happen theyre gonna stop working with motherfucking jay z nobody tells a man with that kind of wealth what to do bottom line it didnt matter that much to him and it did to kanye and if jay z was any kind of real friend to him he would have made it happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guarantee you have at least one attribute that someone out there finds attractive or desirable thats your job is to hone that trait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know a life lesson when i see one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but pandora and spotify both have free options with ads and neither is really bad and pretty much everybodys basic streaming package is the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just hate apple and i know that if they ever get a solid grip on streaming music they are going to start wringing people dry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you dont know them then you dont know if they were ever close or that theyve drifted you just know what you read in some magazine or tabloid and that was probably written by a guy who stands outside nightclubs waiting to ask celebrities inane questions like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wasnt implying that he isnt capable of making the time im saying that when you live a life like theirs you meet a lot of people and if you spent every day going to a funeral for the grandma of someone who produced a track for you or visiting someone you worked with because their spouse was robbed you would literally never get anything done when you look at their relationship as a mentorapprentice one it makes a lot more sense that they arent home boys anymore the tidal thing is just indicative of kanyes misunderstanding of the way business works people dont do shit for him because theyre friends they do shit for him bc they want him to make them money if anything kanye is making it personal because hes dramatic and thats his brand and jay z is deservedly upset that he just flaunts their contract bc theyre friends still right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fair enough those are also good services but id prefer no ads and like how apple music integrates my own offline library i think theyre all great and cater to different needs surprisingly tidal pays artists better so i was hoping that would take off but
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,once you try spotify premium the free version really starts to suck you cant search and play a song can only shuffle all the songs of that particular artist can only shuffle your own songs too gets pretty damn irritating sucks for trips and any other offline listening ads and a bunch of other little things its worth the money to get premium if thats the only music library you got
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trust me it doesnt suck as bad as not having streaming at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tunnel snakes rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfaooo the weekday

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clarence has real nice parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok but cranbrook has a sweet bat house
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he scared to death he scared to look in his fuckin yearbook fuck cranbrook
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,live down the street from cranbrook can confirm cranbrook kids are assholes

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,played soccer against them in high school total assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fym lemme guess fuck you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre not as douchy as brother rice though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never had to play them thank heavens cranbrook was like that weird school that was out of our division but still a regular opponent of ask the schools hamtramck was the only one who was straight up mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets just say brother rice kids make cranbrook kids look like the nicest rocket scientist ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,brother rice was horrible although i cant say much i went to seaholm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no shit when did you graduate i was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you guys got the fancier all redone seaholm lol lucky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what about this is black people andor twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does x want to get blackballed by the recording industry because this is how you get blackballed by the recording industry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes about to be exxxiled from the music industry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay im sure this dude has hands but i doubt he has the power to take on the ovo sweatshop let alone the new muscle and beard english grime drake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i gave her dick she אָמֵן ay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this dude serious can someone explain the beef with these and who exactly us this dude for him to grt attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i put a hole in your parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he got blackballed the moment he called out drake so this doesnt even matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youd think he would his this crap after his recent offence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,blackballed youre saying hell face professional consequences for insulting another singer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he got signed with atlantic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ovoschwitz can easily handle him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you forget joe budden exposed drakes plastic surgery and lipo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his fight videos are honestly very entertaining
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao pretty accurate lyrics fam beat does bump though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drake kinda stole his sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its easy to blindly hate this dude when people hear a diss on drake and instantly think fuck this kid but imo x has great potential and the whole fiasco is pretty funny although immature edit didnt even take sides and got downvoted goes to show the animosity surrounding his name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean in terms of never having heard about this guy that isnt really surprising to put things in perspective there are artists with tens of millions of views on youtube that youve never heard of and social media figures with millions of followers you may never come across doesnt necessarily have much to do with age id argue theres still a difference between being internet famous and being famous in the real world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gg drake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no he didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,links now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay rip drake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drake stole one of his flows and drake steals everyones flows so i dont why xxx is so heated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,had to look dude up false imprisonment and assault on a pregnant woman at the age of lol fuck this clown even if drake stole his sound it aint like this coward would blow up with it with his background
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,x has great potential listens to look at me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree with you dude he bringing something new to the game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah apparently the info was false
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just speculating but i think its because x was facing life and imo it just feels dirty to steal a flow from someone is locked up and cant defend himself now that hes out it seems like he wants drake to know hes not cool with it on top of that drake acted like he never heard of x and just happened to stumble upon the flow if x is telling the truth apparently drake contacted one of xs people and said he fucked with him before the song dropped x is just an lil edgy dude and if he doesnt work on his temper its seriously gonna hold him back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i keep seeing people say that the girlfriend admitted to lying about it but seeing all these charges for other shit has me thinking he might have done it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he did his time lmao let the man get his the best way he knows how
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao im not gonna lie i genuinely like that song
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fr hard beat but he trash to be fair thats the only thing ive listened to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sippintea was on some if you rap you lose video and i just thought it was all whack looked up a couple songs and bruhhhh hes whack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that song was so bad on spotify they have that thing that tells you about the song as it plays one of the slides was like everything was done in minutes hes just good like that sounded like min effort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah fair enough but id argue thats pretty common for artists before they get to a certain threshold especially for rappers in particular because they have a tendency to get really popular pretty quickly and lose all of that momentum in a short time span not that im comparing xxx to them substantively or in terms of potential but there were tons of people who were dismissive of j cole drake kanye and many other now well known acts when they first debuted built in skepticism conversely there arewere plenty of artists that some people were sure would blow up who never went anywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this blokes voice is annoying as shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo thats wild drake faker than we thought i guess he still need the ovo gander to help him with that one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he hopped on the xtrain tho like once look at me really blew up drake was like yo this flow works again and did what he does every single time putting his own voice on other peoples style fuck i hate the facit that so many people i know call drake goat and all that shit when he hasnt done his own work for years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes a goon for sure his girl is psycho too tho so idk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same bump to it every day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao i thought the total opposite i think xxx has really good potential with his screamcore trap shit but that beat is mixed horribly and has poor progression
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if thats the only thing you listened too why you conclude hes trash 😑
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never heard riot have you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this nigga aint get no lipo lolprobably budden trying to stay relevant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he tried to do dr miami like he did quentin miller and it failed lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit drake told you all of that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wasnt inspired to hear any more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not confirmed but look at before and after pics kinda show it but i aint dr miami so idk but budden said this in just because whcihc was one of his tracks dismantling drake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dead ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean why bulk cut if you can just bulk lipo id take that shortcut too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drake wasted his money then cuz he look body fat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well the accusation is that drake did lipo on his stomach to have more defined abs so of course hes still going to look soft everywhere else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man im gonna get a job stop smoking and drinking all that good shit three months later on ig posting a picture of them with a blunt and oe with the caption hmu fam i got that 🌲🌲🌲🌲🌲🔥🔥🔥🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a typo in the title ive acknowledged it go easy on me homies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think wesleys problem was not filing returns lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you imagine the shit storm it would cause if obama admitted to dodging taxes back before he was elected they would a ran his ass out out the country trump gets away with so much because hes a rich white guy its ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meanwhile jimmy carr is hosting a dozen shows
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha for sure but chris rock went in on him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not because hes a rich white guy mitt romney wouldnt have been able to say half the stuff hes said either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,since it was completely legal i dont think it would have affected obama too much just like claiming he wasnt born in the states didnt affect him if anything made his supporters stronger and if it had been proven during the primaries that obama did this who do you think would have been the one attacking him not just republicans but hillary clinton too the clintons used the same tax loophole in to declare a loss in order to pay less in taxes donald trump is audited every year and is never accused of a violation what he did was a business move that the clintons also use and obama would have used if he had been running a multi million dollar business that had lost money one year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but jimmy carr publicly apologized and refused to make excuses even when they were provided he paid the fines and repented totally different situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mitt romney wasnt an alleged billionaire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think that makes a difference mitt romney is still very rich ill put it out there that i like trump more than hillary and he does get away with a lot of stupid shit but its not because hes a billionare i really doubt romney would have gotten away with anything trump has said if he had a a few more hundred million dollars at that point of wealth i dont think it matters not in this context at least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont tell me what to do

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,time to get your test checked and look into trt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know lots of young millennials especially women cut out gluten like its an allergy so now it seems like a joke but cutting out gluten helps cut down a lot of the stubborn fat and bloat i think its called a celiac belly or more commonly a wheat belly theres plenty of alternatives and as long as youre not buying stupid shit its very easily financially doable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look like nike roshe to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nike kaishi i have the same ones theyre very similar to roshe but a little more sporty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,come on man look at that face its kevin stewart and he is actually in his

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way that hes getting pictures taken of himself like this is weird too it just seems really vain and immature
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at his age he shouldnt be this muscular safe to say you have no idea how his body works probably no blisters on this niggas feet

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ops guy and kevin stewart are the same in that they are both older bearded and into fashion but they arent the same person they look similar but if you image search stewart youll see that they have pretty different faces
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not the same guy the dude from the post has a different shaped beard and a full head of hair also has broader shoulders than this guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol goddamn

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol maybe im out of the loop but i didnt know guys wearing capris was street
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant tell if thats parody or autistic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is actually could be the true reason other than just fashion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,skateboarders used to wear super baggy pants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also stops denim from staining shoes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it has a certain look to it that can really only apply to streetwear outfits or at least stuff thats more streetwear oriented not that you couldnt rock it any other way it just looks best in streetwear imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from skateboarding back when baggy pants were a thing probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i roll mine on days i ride my bicycle to get places cant be tearing pants or getting chain grease on them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was also from skateboarding for mobility wasnt it fixed gear bike messengers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets be honest its nothing but a fashion thing these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dunno having air touch my ankles just feels wrong

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it depends on what hes wearing even taking the examples from the guy above hes pulling off some and not others the first picture i think is great its stylish and classy but in a new school type of way the second outfit isnt terrible but that v neck is a little deeper than necessary and the holes in the jeans look a little silly but honestly i wouldnt think twice about it if i saw him in public the third picture looks pretty trying too hard to be a teenager like hes going to class at a high school its not as bad but similar to a year old wearing ed hardy a few years back i dont know why im posting this to you i dont know what my point is and how its supposed to help you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,let him live his life for the last few years he has on this earth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,acting like your mother this is probably the best shutdown insult in the daddy arsenal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how bout you just let him live his own life jeez you really do sound like your mother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we all have to be old eventually people should be able to choose to exploit whatever youth they have left in them for as long as they want to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my old mans girlfriend decided to update his wardrobe for him it was weird not seeing him in the shirts he got for christmas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,give us an example of shirts he wears
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys wear them now nigga ive been rocking them since
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but we drive hours
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my grandkids wont know that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they wait in the snow for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i bet they would
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the kids wont know that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look up pictures from the ronnie kith doom release in ny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right that would make it too easy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,andreas cahling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit is that j jonah jameson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your balls will shrink tho good bitch they hang way too damn low
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not an expert but my im gonna go ahead and say that gear doesnt do shit for your joints and bones which are the reason for the problem in the first place if anything more mass and more muscle acting on them is going to put more wear and tear on them its probably best for your longevity and general state of deterioration if you work out but stay nattyjust like at any other age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends are you blasting test levels well above normal levels or are you taking test to compensate for low t that typically comes with older age just like anything else moderation is key
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup a huge drawback with taking steroids when youre older for added testosterone is the issues it can cause with your prostate from benign growth that causes bladder pressure and increased urination to a highly increased risk of prostate cancer if those risks werent there it could definitely be useful for older men
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we need to distribute it tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sick fucking gains are not just for yuge wall street superpacs they are for of working americans looking for and struggling day by day to create a dank sexy physique
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no one ever pulls off the cargo suit the first time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is definitely to the swag monster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol is that weird to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really sure what to say i was introduced to him by some friends we started playing music together we played some shows we hooked up once maybe twice hes a sweet impeccably dressed man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep thats the guy one of the most welldressed guys ive ever seen tons of diversity in his choices not afraid to try something outlandish either and he has the swagger to pull off even the weirdest outfits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kevin stewart but the dude in ops photo is built every photo of kevin stewart i can find has him looking much less buff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i was going to say unless somethings changed in his face and he gained like pounds of muscle these are two different guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my legs are too hairy for that style and it bothers me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are there any memes inside this gq magazine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup this is the new style in menswear even suit pants are now being worn short and slim kind of a counter to the last trend when everything was somewhat baggy and long
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til its autistic to have an interest in a specific style of clothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all the fashion subs are for people who either care too much about fashion or have no sense of style so they need to copy others or both which is why rmalefashionadvice has albums with dollar hoodies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone used to wear super baggy pants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like years ago lots of skaters have worn those kind of pants for a while now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big pants small wheels for life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember wearing a white pair of in the grade with a new pair of jeans that hadnt been washed yet i was inconsolable by the days end lookin at those indigo dye stains on my fresh ass air forces grade me learned that day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,couldnt resist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then train the calves and arms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk most people ive seen on there are white i think im the only black guy there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you miss his username
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that ya me you gonna break me off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i swear thats a movie reference but google cant find it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just so you know thats not really how gay couples work d
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you got currys new shoes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same brooks makes awesome running shoes got them ghost incredibly comfortable ugly as sin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you got his grannys number
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same asics though same color scheme and everything so its come to this theyre just so gosh dang comfy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,running and making gray bushed grannies swoon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think everyone does either way you dont really have to defend your shoe choices to nerds on the internet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,adrenaline user checking in love the but the gtx whatever the goretex ones are version hit my knee when i tried using them in the winter a little disappointing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,brooks are amazing i dont see old people where them at all thats more white and blue new balance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like that shit aint hot right now fym
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was my exact analysis of the picture too its probably different for others but its nice to find uncannily similar thoughts in the thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in the last picture im almost positive he is literally in a high school but i have to go back to the lab to see what this really means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aww now i feel bad ok ill let him be forever young
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meaning you aint given any up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like matt barnes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah people today wouldnt walk miles in the snow unless everything in a mile radius of them was gonna die tomorrow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his pecs are epic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that man never ate a donut in his life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,j jonah gaineson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jim gordon now fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,makes the shaft bigger in comparision
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think id be more worried about the heart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure wear and tear isnt the reason for bone density loss in the elderly exercise is one of the best ways to slow or prevent problems with the muscles joints and bones a moderate exercise program can help you maintain strength balance and flexibility exercise helps the bones stay strong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually the gear plus exercise does positively affect your bones and joints of course unless you start lifting really heavy shit he is definitely healthier than a typical old person moreover the muscles act as stabilisers and would prevent typical injuries seen in people of his age considering his heart there is no scientific data relating shortterm doping and any form of heart disease even for longterm users the connection is dubious due to small number of biased studies in any case he will die before any of the longterm problems catch up to him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually the opposite man as long as youre not super jacked but its good to build some good lean muscle around aging joints and places youve injured before its what you do after therapy when you tear a muscle or something similar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends on gear hgh is known to stimulate bone growth however nothing affect calcium absorption which is vital in bone building when you are old regardless how much calcium you consume you will have a net loss this is why it is important to build strong bones early however weight training does improve your bone density by microfracture so weight training regardless of gear improve your bone structure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it does actually increase bone density not sure about joints
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i keep telling my mum to do weights to slow the onset of osteoporosis and she keeps telling me i dont want to be too muscular she gonna break her hip with talk like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the easiest and legal way to get gear is to go to an antiaging doctor and say i feel oldlethargic they run some blood tests then boom drugs in the mail low doses can greatly improve quality of life for older folks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we need six packs not superpacs the top of lifters are making of the gains
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never knew how much i needed this until now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit youre serious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not him though he would not dress like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only way i could understand this comment if it was written by a woman if im talking to a man you are supposed to be hairy nigga embrace that shit and dont let it dictate your fashion choices
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it that uncommon with shorts in the us just assuming country just answer from your country i have really hairy legs but i wear shorts no problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,body hair is no reason to not rock the clothes you want to own your fur
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt it thats closer to autism than what its usually used for on this site
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right there with ya bud lost the dopest pair of white and denim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,very true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok champ says this troll lives in his mothers basement surrounded by cheeto wrappers is years old or both
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought your name was buttstuff and now im kinda upset
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i bet you see that face a lot huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i say what what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do they pay you extra for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh hes never missed it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exclusively at payless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,throw in some short shorts and some goofy ass thick rimmed hipster glasses shit kids nowadays wearing what old grandpas wore back then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,style fashion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just wanted to let you guys know that i share your opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well the last few good years anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and most people die in their that leaves him with like more good years max and then years where the age really starts catching up with him and he cant do that kind of shit anymore parents arent immortal cut them some slack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shhh just go into the light
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,male life expectancy in the us is less for nonasian ethnic groups
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or the kanye song
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,epecs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,j jonah damnson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gym gordon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hello mr piana
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for sure i was thinking more in mechanical terms though since my parent brought up frailty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its probably best for your longevity and general state of deterioration if you work out but stay natty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right ok i mean we could all imagine that but what do you think they consider moderate do you think they want nan to go deadlift and ohp or maybe shes a cross fitter and is gonna kip into a contorted half pull up i think theyre talking about the old butches in the suburbs walking around with dumbbells and a fanny pack not father time over here with the syringe hanging out of his ass cheek
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bones will stay strong but lifting heavy weights all your life will eventually wear down cartilage in your joints a good middle ground is to get buff when youre young then just go once or twice a week for maintenance at the same weights rep ranges until youre old but thats easier said than done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this depends entirely on what cardio he is doing the extra mass is great for his bone density but running will destroy his cartilage just doing an elliptical would be best at this age you still put tension and strain on the bones and move the synovial fluid into and out of the cartilage which is good for both source getting my phd on bone density and live with a phd student who studies cartilage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boy thats what he said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its probably best for your longevity and general state of deterioration if you work out but stay natty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and it is times like this that we must remember the yuge success of bodybuilders in sweden denmark norway iceland and finland remember mr trump and mrs clinton that these nations are able to use social democracy to accurately give a fair and reasonable share of quest bars halotop bulk powder and whey protein to the working and middle class along with the necessary paid vacation time needed in order to recover after extremely intense leg days is this a coincidence i think not rather it was the noble revolution of intelligent voters who proudly secured an economic system where dank sexy gains and sick ass cut bodies are a normal and obtainable right for all and this this is the success of democratically elected progressive politics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or trim and be somewhere in between
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or become a swimmer andor road cyclist shaving your legs isnt uncommon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well some of you guys cant grow leg hair for shit so you dont have to worry about it is it genetics or are there dudes secretly shaving their legs frequently
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think shorts and skinny jeans are two different things one looks like you got hairy legs the other you got a poof of hair like a poodle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i gotta break something to ya buddy you may or may not be surprised
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,d
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am glad i am not the only one who thought he was buttstuff he should totally change his user name

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,checking in on the shared opinion train
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it could also be something he did on purpose because someone requested it like his kid or grandkid or his students if hes a teacher at the high school for an event like halloween or some spirit day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,amen my year old nana spent the last few years doing as she pleased she wanted to go the the casino every other weekend play the slots and drink dos equis i would happily drive her and my mom to the small casino two hours away took her to disney and the beach as shed never been to either she went out happy and doing all the things she had always wanted to do but couldnt due to her asshole husband and sons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,play me a song youre the piana man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right babe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my roommates in college would literally just watch him for hours i swear they were gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,compound lifts are actually pretty low impact when done correctly proper squats will actually straighten the knees by strengthening the surrounding muscle and ligamentstendons high impact exercise like basketball or running on are surface is what deteriorates the leg joints also carrying too much fat in the upper body
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who the hell trims leg hair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he already said gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i can understand if you mean tight pants but jeans exist in shorts format aswell but seem to be hated on reddit

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you commenting on how shes using her finger or the actual finger sometimes i use my right index finger too but not as much of a pointed dagger as she does i kinda have my thumb near the base and my middle finger near the top and index finger swipes

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks fam 👌👌
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn ill try harder next time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh being the victim is so tough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youll know youre there when the yellowy snap filter doesnt change how white you are fr tho i have a friend this white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah ur black now listen to a couple savage songs cry to a drake song and we good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she needs to be your relative first preferably cousin or sister
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i watched that netflix musical about hiphop am i in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre cool were recruiting now that trumps president theres strength in numbers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had a girl in my class that would say not to be racist before everything she said and she said some racist shit every time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow youre so articulate youre pretty for a black girl 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i aint racist but i like skittles more than fruit by the foot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre the whitest black guy ive ever met
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive literally had people who i was acquainted casually say in conversation jman if the rest of them were like you wed have a lot less problems in this country the first time or so i was just dumbfounded after that id just glare and walk away in silence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think my personal favorite which ive seen a ton on reddit is i dont hate black people i just hate black culture like fucking wow so you dont hate black people just everything they do and how they act if you use phrases like one of the good ones all that means to me is that youre completely small minded you have no respect for others choices or lifestyle and just wish everyone would act like you that not tolerance or acceptance thats just asking people to change so that you feel more comfortable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit drives me nuts its either this or well you arent really black youre white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of the good ones hi grandpa
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,conversely my friend has a problem of other black dudes telling him he aint really black cause hes into bruce lee and stuff like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive called customers regardless of race one of the good ones for putting their shopping carts back instead of leaving them in their parking spot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why you use so many different colors to hide info
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reminds me of a comedy sketch where someone said im not a racist but and then went on to say some innocuous shit cant remember for the life of me which show it was though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of the good human beings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thought this post was gonna be about men not race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i mean if you have to qualify it its because its questionable and racist people dont really always make the best judges on what is and isnt racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i say the not to be racist thing in front of things completely unrelated to race just to confuse people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my exs grandmother went with im not a bigot to be fair she was real old and white and i havent met many old white folk that arent racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nothing good comes from that saying either they dont say anything nearly racist like not to be racist but theres a lot of white people here or they go not to be racist but these white people prolly fuckin all their cousins not just one flavorless chicken eatin school shootin ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow youre so articulate this ones the fucking worst
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i touch your hair lord tryna test me today even as a white guy at a mostly black school i got this one from black girls but i got the feeling it wasnt about my hair they were just hitting on me and i was too dumb to notice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wyd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,spending too much time on here you might be late for the rally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that shit was so annoying in high school meanwhile some dumbass walking through the hallway rapping along to some song for no reason walks by and they say casey is white and hes blacker than you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,preach bro i get that shit to this day smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy fuck i think i just got ptsd remembering this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like i heard this more from other black people than any other race it was honestly one of the most annoying things to hear im glad niggas in college dont seem to give a shit though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one time at a house party i was at i saw a white guy trying to explain to a black guy why he was basically white because he was like going for a physics degree and liked rush some other dude came out of nowhere and punched him in the face it was pretty dope
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah some people really wear their ignorance on their sleeves like i had once a girl tell me that i was surprisingly normal and smart when i told her that my father was an immigrant and muslim of course it wasnt racist or anything like that because were both white but still a pretty fucked up thing to say to someone youve just met
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this white girl one time told me somalipirate you are not like them your are more like us made me feel like the biggest uncle tom ever and i wondered what i did to make her perceive that never the less i stopped hanging out with her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree but the other day i was at a cookout in compton this little boy or was twerkin copying his older sister his cousins started threatening to beat him if he didnt stop dancing gay and whatnot i said it was harmless and he should just do whatever he wanted and they said naw men arent supposed to dance like that and while i agree that a grown man twerkin in the club would be kinda weird i think homophobia and threats of violence run rampant in black communities thats the sort of stuff that bothers mewe dont seem to be as progressive as i imagined considering all the stuff weve been through for being different
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then have the nerve to copy the culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you ask them to describe black culture you can see that the only exposure they have to black americans is bet and tyler perry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this post and posts like are why i love this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think my personal favorite which ive seen a ton on reddit is i dont hate black people i just hate black culture if youre ignorant i guess that makes sense i can totally see why you would not hate black people but very much hate someone who describes themselves as a ghetto hood nigga or goes around with his pants half down and a gun in the back you have no respect for others choices or lifestyle and just wish everyone would act like you do you not understand how bad ghettoes are that not tolerance or acceptance t fuck that thats like saying people should tolerate the lifestyle choice that is radical islam thats just asking people to change so that you feel more comfortable yes people should be civilized if not they have no business in civilization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what have they not heard of jim kelley aka the inspiration for bushido brown on the boondocks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im half latino and half black so sometimes when black people dont know me theyll say you arent really black conversely when im around hispanics i dont know theyll say you arent really hispanic this isnt because of any of my interestsif they were judging off of my interests alone id be stereotypically black with some sprinkles of white and an affinity for latin women but its just because of my skin color my hair and the way i speak i dont think i ever had it really bad with fitting into any crowd once people got to know me but those initial comments always made me angry people seem to forget how much weight their words carry myself included
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they sound like one of the good ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was feeling artsy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im surprised the admins dont crack down on this sub for how seldom ops bother to hide that stuff i guess its cause this sub isnt known for brigadingharassing other online communities
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,made me think of the sandwich thing im not racist but i like to cut my sandwiches into triangles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks john mulaney
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not to be racist but alakazam is so underpowered in pokémon go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my boss compared me to hillary banks after saying that one i was so shocked i didnt even know what to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,years ago i was a lil dreadhead who went to a high class elementary school so many lies about dreads do you wash your hair your hair is weird what are these i was like a new specimen of the black man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and it pains me to say i used to say stuff like that had a mexican friend as an underclassman in college who was a real nerd smart kid kinda awkward i remember one time saying jj is the whitest mexican kid youll ever meet to someone who said they werent fond of mexicans or some dumb shit it was a while later before it sort of clicked that no hes just a mexican he can act or be any which way he damn well pleases white people dont have a reservation on being nerdy engineers with problems talking to girls and a penchant for ralph lauren
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,casey is white and hes blacker than you that shits kind of annoying from the other end too me enjoys hip hop friends youre not black
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you like computers wow thats isnt normal for many others ¿¿que
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats because people are more willing to change how they define you than to change how they define black people its such backwards way of thinking that would be ridiculed if applied to business or science or any other human endeavors but its very prevalent when the subject is people people have solidified their views on black people and decide that when youre not like their definition you should be reclassified as something youre not white people see intelligence work ethic righteousness as white qualities and the opposites as black qualities so when they meet a black person who is smart hard working kind they say theyre white because they have all the qualities that they associate with white people its kinda infuriating really because it should be obvious that youre a black person with good qualities but instead of completing the thought process and understanding that black people are human like everyone else they come to the conclusion that youre a white person in the wrong skin like somehow you misled them by being an upstanding black person instead of a gangbanging junkie who could never be a professional
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck yes ive been so close to throwing hands for shit like that but now i dont even feel anger anymore when someone calls me white its just resentment and a very precipitous drop in respect for whoever said it it happens often enough that i just expect it now as sad as that might be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck yes telling me that the aspects of me that you appreciate are the white ones is some of the most racist shit ive ever heard and white people dont understand why i get offended at all fuck i wish my best friend didnt move at least i could count on him if we were in a crowd of white people now its me looking like the token
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for some reason im imagining that story with the falcon pawnch sound effect in it that should be a video compilation people getting falcon punched for saying racist shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ohhh god that sounds like a personal fantasy of mine wish i could have been there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its weird because its a compliment in their eyes but id feel like an uncle tom hanging around her after that too she sees that black people are actually not all thugs but still clings to her racist beliefs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my teacher just gave me the youre not like the rest of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think homophobia and threats of violence run rampant in black communities this is some straight dumb shit that exists in all communities
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its somewhat in part of just how people are raised like with the homophoebia stuff its mostly in part that its been something instilled so much because its a sin and it aint right that and not really having that much of exposure to other views or and hardly any association with people in the lgbtq community keeps the homophobic mindset flowing im just speculating though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the boondocks episode of mlk did sort of say the same thing that black culture is now a mockery of itself i highly disagree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is not black culture though if anything thats an older way of thinking for men because homosexual stuff is looked down upon especially because of religion ive seen white women say homophobic stuff too so really i dont see how that has anything to do with black culture and you use the quintessential but in your sentence that a lot of not racist people use
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel bad for black women because they generalized as bossy and all these other negatives smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes people should be civilized if not they have no business in civilization and with that you have damned yourself cheers for the chuckle some of the heartiest chuckles come from laughing at the misfortune of others hypocrites even more so would read nonsensical comments of yours again i feel ive been pretty civilized considering
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can totally see why you would not hate black people but very much hate someone who describes themseleves as a ghetto hood nigga or goes around with his pants half down and a gun in the back why why do you very much have to hate that person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my friend laughs it off cause hes quite possible bhudda in human form but i do get angry sometimes when people call him an oreo for not being loud or not being a fan of rap music it gives me the impression that people are dissapointed he didnt liveup to the stereotype they had in their head like im dominican and people have literally said are you sure youre dominican cause i dont fit the loud henny drinking fuckboy image they have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,john mulaney not to be racist but i dont know who that is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just dont say anything make it awkward and they know they fucked up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i lowkey sort of side eye my white friend when he starts going in on some rap song lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,back in high school i got called oreo and people told me i wasnt really black and they said it as a compliment so i took it as one never really had black friends in my circle until recently now i think back and realize how incredibly disrespectful that was and shake my head at myself for my ignorance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i mean im white so i cant really say that like ive felt it i moved from a diverse town to a really white one and i realized that if youre surrounded by white people especially the more redneck types and in places where there arent many minorities sometimes you just gotta deal with denigrative bullshit like that shit at my towns high school there were two kids named will one black and one white they were known as will and black will i asked black will about like how he felt about it once and he basically told me that he used to get mad about it at first but people just laughed him off so at a certain point it was a waste of energy because he couldnt stop people from calling him that and they could be calling him a lot worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah bro that us vs them mentality was deeply entrenched in her so like a bad job i quit her ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the homophobia i agree where i was raised in la with koreans japanese midupper class blacks and whites it was definitely most prevalent when i was around blacks the whites used gay dyke and faggot way more than the blacks but the blacks seemed to fight way more often if you know la i went to school in brentwood and then beverly hills so it wasnt a money thing either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt make it ok thats like saying racism is ok because you were raised to be that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,naw yeah i agree thats definitely part of it i understand the homophobia in regards to ones religious roots sure i dont agree but whatever what i dont get is why they were so quick to threaten the kid with violence i got whipped as a kid for sure but that was for doing things that were immoral like lying and cheating things that wouldve made me a bad and untrustworthy adult this year old was literally dancingtf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the boondocks episode of mlk did sort of say the same thing that black culture is now a mockery of itself boondocks can be a little hotepy tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was one of the boondocks episodes ive heard about but never seen before it really doesnt seem like its style i remember the episode w thuggalicious or we his name was and him making some gay song which parodied how some rappersartists would make raps or songs with lowkey gay shit in it but i just cant imagine them dissing black culture as a whole especially using mlk to judge it idk though they got a new guy in charge i heard so that could be it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres no need to be so bigoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have to hate not really but in reality most people avoid people who act like stupid standoffish brutes trying to emulate violent rap songs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude youre meant to kill him then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not to be racist but all you white guys look alike
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im going to try this next time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youd probably get a kick out of me then i dont dress the part of white dude trying to be black or whatever im an ultra nerd that bumps rap in my joe commuter car all day everyday like michael bolton from office space
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stay woke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i called my black friend an oreo as a joke once we joked around saying he was black on the outside white in the inside hes a cool guy and thought it was funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my school had other people with the same name as me i was put in that same situation they just added a black in front of my name didnt feel great
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its exactly like will said its also hard to be super upset at people because they dont understand what it feels like at all they also dont really get how fucked up a sentiment it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do you think black jesus feels everyday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at my school two dudes in the same friend group are named mark and they call each other asian mark and mexican mark not sure why i just remembered that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think they called him black will because he was one of the few black people in the town really just a way to point someone out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never said it was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly im glad those exact words managed to pour their way out of your soul my work here is done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,be careful where you write that man because on certain subreddits people would definitely call you racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk it just seems off to me lmao he just seems so weird trying to rap and be hard so i side eye him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao the awkward type
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not particularly offensive or anything its just dumb calling me an oreo for being into robotics and theater makes it seem like those interests are somehow innately white its like everyone wants there to be one kind of black kid and if you arent that youre an outlier and you get called out on it on both sides its ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if the other two were white how did they distinguish between the two also has none of them heard of surnames
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,would it feel different if there was one other kid who was white and they referred to him as as white x
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,men dont have feelings get outta here with that gay shit s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mostly coontown and donald trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then proceed to be racist themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like everyone wants there to be one kind of black kid and if you arent that youre an outlier and you get called out on it on both sides its ridiculous i mean tbf if youre a light skin you get shit on all the time for being too white so that knife cuts both ways you know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess but theres times where white people do things that seem black and they get called that its not racis just stupid i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they had plenty opportunity to do so in my years of high school but chose not to do so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or like a lot of the default subs like advice animals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and difference is that theyll say something actually racist and fucked up instead of an innocent joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that sounds so shitty to me people that would do that treat black as something that makes you a pariah at my high school kids would just call people by their last or middle name instead i guess im halflucky because my name is so unique ill never have to worry about sharing it with someone else though so its never been a problem for me on the other hand i get people butchering it constantly because its weird and wondering why i couldnt have a normal name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we had white nicole who was mix and black nicole who was light skin we also had a siannikki funny thing is because we had so many muslims and somalians in our school we ended up defaulting to last names instead of having or mohameds or abdis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i guess that must suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is always the abs for me that sit up i once did is really paying off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that scene is fucking hilarious when hes flexing while pounding these two bitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this one is too real she caught me lookin too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep thats almost exactly what happens in the scene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is this from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rockin that onepack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah that movie was just a string of amazing scenes business card scene classic please deposit a stray cat classic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sabrina dont just look at her assignmentsassholeeat it editautocorrect strikes again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it perfectly displays how psycho he his lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,american psycho its a great film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that one line straight down the middle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have a two pac and a gut like not even hard they just sit there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can get a reservation at dorsia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as long as you know that it is a dark comedy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nobody goes there anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,repost bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf jose manalo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good baby baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ik hes plastered in the word gucci but the big gucci looks like it says succ
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this isnt basic hoeingthis is advanced hoeing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my side chick is chinese guess im winning double time but really im just a lyin single and lonely blackjew just trying to look cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does she deliver
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then the side bitch calls a real chinese restaurant and order the food to his house
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,am i the only one here who oders chinese food with a fake asian accent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why are you getting a call from chinese food
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why dont you just name your hoes dudes names no chick is gonna ask why bryan is texting you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,advanced hoeing is if she spoke chinese bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looks like you could take a lesson in commenting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hoeing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,versus the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,blackjew neonazis hate him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black jew man ive never met a black jewish guy before and i grew up surrounded by jews
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fellow blewish youre not alone we still got lenny kravitz and each of his nose rings outchea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats when you know shes earned the promotion switcharoo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,otherwise they always mess up my order
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont use a fake accent but i do say my name is ed zachary
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont do that but if i have noticed the asian women are nicer to me if i ask for chop sticks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who doesnt use grubhub or beyond menu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah but my mom makes me go in because they like me more im adopted im korean with white parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if u think about it it makes sense when people learn english theyre more understandable with an american or english accent and if youve ever learned a foreign language the native speakers understand you better if you use their accent idk if this works for asian languages tho edit typos also feel free to down vote me to hell but
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my pickup is ready gotta go get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a white male nobody asked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whites cheat just the same gtf out of here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,xiexie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe she does but the gf level is low so she doesnt have to use her main moves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the comment wouldnt post the first time i tried to i cancel it and tried again looks like they all worked and reddit lied to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were a rare breed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibetaisrael theres a significant population of jews who have ethiopian ancestry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,may lenny lead us to many mitzvahs with those rings while drizzy give us someone to act like we know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that literally makes no sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youve completely misunderstood what the link you posted says its saying if you speak with another persons accent youll find it easier to understand them not if you speak with an accent that the other person will find it easier to understand you i speak from experience as a student of language that i find it harder to understand learners who have a similar accent to me when speaking their compared with actual native speakers nonnative speakers listen to native speakers all day and learn the language from them they typically dont listen to people speak in their own accent those chinese guys who work in the restaurant dont speak english to each other they speak chinese
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice save now if only i could think like that on my feet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,any chick thats a side chick and accepting of the fact is basic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looks like reddit wins this time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually i remember when i went to jewish camp this guy sang black and jewish to the tune of black and yellow for the talent show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,awdah source am chinese
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes it does i didnt make it up using the accent of the language you are speaking is part of properly speaking the language and makes you easier to understand its part of pronouncing the words correctly so in reverse if you imitate the accent of the person you are talking to youre using sounds theyre familiar with and it makes it easier for them to understand but as i said im not entirely sure how this works with asian languages in particular
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless youre speaking patois or another creole language im pretty sure speaking a language with a fake accent is unhelpful and insulting source asian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill back you up i learned a second language and i understand americans trying to speak the language more than natives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,asian here too its a lot easier to understand someone whos not faking an accent also its very clear whether youre faking an accent or not and its insulting dont be surprised if someone decides to mess with your order
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks i do appreciate it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,third asian here what about if youre part of two or more cultures with inherently different english dialects i dont think the commenter above intended to be insulting at all but the shadow of mickeyrooney mesohorny linguistic sterotypes looms large especially where there is a power gradient between dominant and immigrant cultures i mean if im at a malaysian restaurant here in australia iil use english words but im not going to say oi mate i could smash a tinnie of tiger and can ya whip me up a kingsize bowl of laksa out back im bloody stahhhhving ill say one tiger beer and can make big laksa or not hungry one both are valid and rooted in historical precedent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for providing a source uitsamegarrioh perhaps made the most important comment which is that the asian accent has some deep historical significance baggage just like the deep southern drawl does as mentioned in the article i dont speak dutch so i dont know how an accent impacts someone understanding it but its definitely interesting that the study found a positive correlation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,definitely can see code switching in subtle ways as much more effective in being understood than a fullblown fake accent he did provide a source for his assertion too so i kind of feel bad for all the down votes he got
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still got my nut off so idc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who even tweets stuff like that lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo jokes aside if your girl tweets shit like this then she is a hoe for real thats just being a shitty person find a new girl

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yall sleepin on pluto be careful of who you make fun of in the milky way 💪
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alternative planets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the national aeronautics and space shade administration
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto is smaller than our moon if that counts as a planet im andre the giant smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like that drew is a meme now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you heard bout pluto thats messed up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can someone please tell me where this meme is actually from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do so many people have so much emotional attachment to pluto being a planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sad pluto httpiimgurcomezpbmvxjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if a rock smaller than our moon can count as a planet than girls cant ever complain about the size of my dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dreeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this would be better if the face moved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,based on the current definition of a planet you cant really even assume that all those exoplanets are actually planets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in national aeronautics and space administration
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is actually a group within nasa that does want to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,might be too late but i made it animate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those new planets found are lightyears away theres no way its ever gonna matter to us than knowing they exist pluto is a dwarf planet because there are a few other planets around plutos region of space that are the same size which prompted scientists to distinguish them from normal planets which share less similarities to pluto and its dwarf bros
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how does this post fit this sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto is a microplanet fam its a scientific condition look it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we just took a shit load of sexy pictures of you pluto to put on tinder what more do you want now you dont have to use those shitty old black and white low res ones you have on there now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your mom thought i was big enough pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how come nasa dont want me man pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto is a quarter the size of our moon get over it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im still not used to seeing drew everywhere man edit though the dude is full of good gifs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looks like dexter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is a ninth planet in the solar system but its not you pluto sorry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,top agree pluto is indeed a planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,forever alone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto will always be a planet in my heart viva la pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that shaun king or just a random white guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto is a motherfucking planet bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre alright dont orbit sol next year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,laughing tears at the absurdity of this post well done bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,big if true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whys the imgur post called jupiter though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be accurate pluto would have to be smaller than the two on the bottom right then youd ask why the fuck are they not planets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hottest title always in the comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real though they didnt reclassify pluto as a dwarf planet it was the international astronomical union iau nasa had nothing to do with it and they brought you back pictures of the damn thing now you puttin em on blast for no fuckin reason without doing a damn bit of research smh edit international asshole union pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also eris which is a little further out is actually bigger than pluto its not even the largest kuiper belt object
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not just that pluto is a planet in a belt of multiple planets and some of these planets are bigger than pluto so if we count it as a planet similar to mars there are planets before pluto that we should but instead we consider them as a belt in unity instead of dividing them which actually sounds nicer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two of the major reasons pluto isnt considered a planet anymore is that it doesnt have enough mass to clear its orbit around the sun and its moon is similar enough in size that they actually orbit one another
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,preach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jupiter and saturn both have moons larger than mercury though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its still weird
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know thats right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a playas move
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its from a video game site giant bomb that does streaming on fridays and such the meme is from a video they did back in though not recent at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its gotta be a dae kid thing since it got changed in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,republican politicians have taught americans that if they dont want to have to learn something new they can just change the science
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because my mum wont serve us nine pizzas anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,follow up question what is so bad about calling it a dwarf planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you cant really even assume that all those exoplanets are actually planets says theyre not planets doesnt explain why calls then planets anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wot n exploration
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice comment repost
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,large if not falsified
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry for being out of the loop but where did this spicy meme originate im seeing it everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bigly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hate to ask but where did this big if true shit start memewise or do all of you just say it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gas giant supremacists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont let the name of the image distract you from the fact that the falcons blew a pt lead in the super bowl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually since the new horizon measurements we now believe that pluto is larger than eris but we still need better measurements on eris
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,planet nine has not been directly observed yet but its approximately times more massive than pluto httpsenwikipediaorgwikiplanetnine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was that its gravity wasnt strong enough to pull its mass into a sphere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean the center of their mutual orbit is a point outside of plutos surface
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two of the major reasons pluto isnt considered a planet anymore is that it doesnt have enough mass to clear its orbit in fact there are two similar sized planetoids in that same orbit one of which is actually bigger than pluto so if pluto is a planet so are the other two
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but unfortunately the lucrative meme business caused him to go and leave giant bomb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty much its still a planet to me damnit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean its mostly just because people dont want to admit that something they have been told their whole lives has been wrong but sure it can be those nasty republicans for everything bad ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bullshit scientists have taught americans that science changes as the information changes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well exoplanets are a bit different from planets currently for an object to be considered a planet in our solar system it has to meet a few requirements orbits the sun has sufficient mass to be round or nearly round is not a satellite moon of another object has removed debris and small objects from the area around its orbit we dont presently have the technology to test all of these conditions for objects orbiting other stars so astronomers have placed them all in the same broad category of exoplanets in the future however its possible that some of these exoplanets may be demoted most likely failing on the point just like poor old pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont go around the sun duh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some may be dwarf planets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jumbo if factual
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were gonna build some rings and were gonna make saturn pay for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never forget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pluto mi eris best estimate mi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i reckon you and i should get out there clear this shit up we could be heroes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats actually a much more accurate way to define it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont remind me my heart cant take it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eris is bigger our moon is bigger why should pluto be categorized as a planet when theyre not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just saying about of americans who believe pluto should be a planet are republicans coincidence i think not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meh if meh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt jupiter have rings but theyre really thin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the argument i use is so what about the size eris is bigger and should be a planet too if we end up with planets that is aok in my book the earth has more than rivers we dont expect you to know them all but schools teach what rivers are and teaches the important ones if the isa can get a definitive and scientific distinction between two different sized rocks then those rocks are the same to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the moon doesnt orbit the sun so thats not a fair relation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bigly if not fake news
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt america already have a wall
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well technically it does it orbits sun while orbiting earth also it isnt about orbiting sun pluto is part of a belt of multiple planets it is still a planet but we dont count it separate like mars but instead as a part of the belt a belt that has bigger planets than pluto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,small if alternative facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes we should move the wall to jupiter take their rings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hands if not my presidents

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why does this even have upvotes its only the time its been posted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was smoking out this chick that buys from me all the time yesterday and now reading this im tryna figure out if i missed out on some head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some of the best weed a lot of smart people who know a lot about weed have called it fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ha gurl men are so easy to twist up i swear on god i got free pizza on the way tonight 😝😝😝 two days later men are pigs i cant believe how some of you treat women wheretherealmenat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,finessed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same is true if you show up to a party with some rolled up blunts bitches act like you fine af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its called count yoo blessings sometimes way too often
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch chill its a free sample lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they must have read the art of the deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this whole thread is just a bunch of justifications for why i dont do nice things just for the sake of being a good person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol i lov using my bewbs to get free things from stupid men lol how dare men see me for my body
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah so basically trumps deal making skills
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly im kinda getting sick of these bitches be like type posts where the threads just turn into shitting on women its milder than redpill type subs but this place has felt kinda misogynistic lately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was chattin to my guy the other day about tinder he says bruh why you need tinder for i just give em some bud and pow theyre on it like eh both ways work mines just cheaper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who is sucking dick for a blunt only coke dealers have that kind of leverage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you could always cut her off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not only that well make him pay for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought that said wheretherealmentat and i got super excited
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,loooool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,feel free to make some oc in the other direction
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought i was the only one lot of bitter men posts lately right i will take downvotes with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this a real post
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you not the only one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the field here is kinda even we shit on dudes as much as we shit on females really a lot of this stem from personal experience too my weedman always talking about hella hoes flocking on his dick bc he got the weed then tons of females talking about how they finesse a man for the ganja so foh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black community is hella misogynistic this is black people twitter dontcha know but in all seriousness do you complain about all of the niggas be like posts plenty of those shit on men i understand the dynamic is different because of sexism but come on now we shit on all sorts of people here edit nevermind just scrolled down a few pages there are an abnormal amount in here this week kinda odd we gotta mix it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its called a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is odd because all these stereotypes fit bulgarian women so you should be used to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if shes fuckin for some weed she was probably dtf anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know about cheaper seeing as you usually pay to go out to eat and stuff i can get a dime for like bucks and im in there i think mine is a bit cheaper no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dealing heroin will get you anything you ask for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,buys from me all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its adderall
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao literally saw your post in the other thread like this and went from am i really the only one whos seeing this shit to oh aiite the more reasonable folks here arent getting caught up in the bs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea top post yesterday was basically women are choosing beggars as if thats a gendered thing now its the whole women love to brag about using men thing which will inevitably bring in people with fresh complaints about how shitty women are all im saying is that if someone made posts like these about men on this sub theyd get a ton of shit for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea if it really felt like everyone was getting roasted equally i wouldnt really have an issue but it seems like this sub is getting dominated by posts complaining about girls and tbh theres too much of that shit on reddit anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right its weed not coke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or just puts out without thinking about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and a few things you didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well shit you got money what do you need head from her for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not women are choosing beggars its making fun of a particular type of woman who does this this isnt applying to all women and the fact that you seem to think so makes you way more mysoginistic than what you think the post is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seems like an appropriate and reasonable response
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meme economy is low right now not many big memes out right now so right now most posts are just random dudes complainingmaking fun of something dudes tend to talk about girls just gotta hope rdankmemes cranks something out soon to give bpt something to work with thats my analysis of the situation what do you think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you serious how does that happen as someone from a legal state i cant imagine literally almost every time you sell to a girl you bang plus weed makes me insanely introverted not want to go out of my way to have sex with a drug dealer lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im sure the dota play is swimming in ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like gun boom black or knife swoosh blood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but its usually a certain type of women that get shit on even though men do the same shit thats the part i take issue with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,extroverted people getting high with other extroverted people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,part of it is just that by being the plug you have social status youre also probably good at talking to people cause thats what salespeople are good at when i was a dealer and smoked a girl out id always pull the i never usually smoke out people i sell to for free but i really fuck with you card
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i knew a rich asian fraternity kid i used to get weed from at fsu who only interrupted dota to sell weed after he graduated i dont know if he gets a lot of ass though dont know much about asian fraternity life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,truuuu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea idk i have a lot of sex in humblebrag but that shit happens to me when doing cocaine or alcohol not when selling weed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,asian chicks love a good moba player the weed is just a plus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im bored we should do something crazy yeah okay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what that be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rdankmemes is leaking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mans driving into head on traffic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what does it look like the guys impressing her by driving in reverse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mins in and the comments are already getting spicy 🍿👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meeks style in every single one of his songs sounds like he was running from the cops on foot for minutes they eventually caught up to him and told him that theyll let him go if he spits some bars into the mic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like this picture better than the one with the woman and the equations in the air new meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga came through we he got it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the irony of this fucking thread fact meek took a couple ls the past year fact drakes last album had good tracks but wasnt a banger fact is still fresh and goes hard quit dick riding and recognize when someone doesnt deliver and when good music is made
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,views was trash is fucking fantastic in comparison
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ftw youre white and lurking for the funny memes and then have literally no idea what a post is about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is mostly trash nicki and vert own froze the difference and offended are listenable but not great the rest is trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because everyone is naturally a drake stan and dont want to admit it if meek didnt have a trash response and actually had a response that sounded like it actually came from him he would have been fine he wouldnt have won because again everyone is a drake stan and would just shove it off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never understood the meek taking an l shit because meek is generally a better rapper than drake and has always been thats fucking fact
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meek can make the best double album of all time but i still feel like its our duty to make fun of him and ill be damned if we stop making drake memes literally everything known picture of him is comical
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it actually lit or does he still sound like a cracked out mickey mouse because that game diss was weakkk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,talm bout like i can understand ebonics but when people transfer it to text for an internet meme i lose a little faith in humanity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,comments are getting spicy all two of them at this point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drake threads are the best because hes either the best rapper in the game and totally shrekt meek or hes straight trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao ive been trying to find a way to describe his music to my mates and i think ill borrow this for next time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never laughed so hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i like meek but i can only listen to so many of his songs in a row lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that pics been around for a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,views literally put me to sleep the first time i listened to it i wanna hear some heat not some soft ass nigga serenading over the beat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i liked hype
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dae
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre comparing bag music to hype misic though i like views and i like theyre not alike
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drakes a varied artist hes got banger albums for the dudes then he makes albums for the ladies guess which one views is and ask yourself which one a girl would rather have on with youre going at it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,views seemed like that at first but after a few listens it has some classics to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meek mill and drake were arguing about something and drake had a way better imo diss track and since then whenever meek did something he was made fun of now he has released a new album which is apparently good and drakes last album was bad imo so they have switched sides and the drake fans are confused in the image
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is this downvoted let the nigga have an opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,check your ears fam is lit on the regular offended tony story litty way up blue notes lights out all flames for that matter the only low point is nickis verse on froze so i know for a muhfucking fact you dont know what youre talking bout
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree dont understand what ppl are so hyped for but to each his own
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he took an l with back to back but delivered elsewhere i hope noone disagrees hes a better rapper because he is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ride that dick baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how does drakes dick taste
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just stop this whole haha everything meek milll does is bad is just kind of dumb at this point his game diss wasnt even that weak but i will say the whole beef in general was dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of all the terrible shit in the world thats what does it to make you lose faith
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah it already started
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,loads of great tracks for sure just overall as a project i felt it was a bit boring is a hell of a long time to focus on a album or maybe i just have adhd but if that time is used well then its fine drake didnt make good use of this time and bored us to death but some great tracks still came out of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the weakest argument in the book the ladies love it i said the same thing about my andrew christian underwear collection and all it gets you is dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,define classic nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck these assholes i agree with you but only like songs stuck tc the best for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,party next door wrote half of that album including one dance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol nah man you cant even be doin that on this site
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for the love
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you forgot outro bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,her verse was good her lil uzi vert impression at the end was wack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and this is why youre a big fucking retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay fine ill admit jumping on the hate meek bandwagon but if you think his game diss wasnt that weak you buggin lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its funny cause he talks like that all the time on here what a whiny motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao thats a pretty good one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well dont be so angry about it damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,heres my opinion lol no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you dont sing along when one dance comes on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that beat is so fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip lil snupe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,truth meeks diss track against drake was weak af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,declaring classics is probably beginning to step over the line of simply an opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,macarena classic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not drake game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,crine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what stance do i take if i think macarena is a classic but i also still hate views
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga out there looking like a broke ass pain from the akatsuki
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you throw dollars at him he chases them i havent done it but ive witnessed it go giants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this the walkway near att park
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was wondering if it was me or that nigga look like he might bust out a cardboard box house jutsu right there on the street
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game 🚾
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these are facts people love stunting for social media
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats a crowd to a god
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my favorite stereotype about black people is that they freak out over magic thats the most wholesome stereotype ive ever seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ngl when i worked at a haunted house type thing at six flags and i wanted a good scare to boost my confidence i knew a group of black people would probably scream if i popped out at them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wonder how this black ppl go crazy of magic became a thing altho i am kinda amazed at magic most of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ayyyy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes bring the good cartoon memes back fuck the forced ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rblackmagicreaction thank me later
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol at the guy on the far left
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love aziz ansaris bit about it in one of his specials
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its pretty much my go to when i explain that not all stereotypes are inherently hurtful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we really need more wholesome stereotypes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its origins actually arent that wholesome sorry to ruin that for you its prob the least offensive stereotype though but still kind of problematic today at most its prob just annoying im not wagging my finger at you though just letting you know some people dont feel the same way about that edit i see people dont understand maybe dont assume things
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,read trevor noahs book not so wholesome if your neighbour kills your cat because that means a witch is around
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that dude that does the handstand makes this for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more accurate and relevant httpimgurcomalexua
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that handstand 😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it began with david blaines street magic videos and specials
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh you think they dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gtfo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i just think black people are more expressive generally speaking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in some extent in every culture there are people who believe in magic in mexico some people believe in witches and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well theres the one that says asians are good at everything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are but people get too touchyfeely and everything is offensive see asians are good at school women are good nurturers etc edit if you need proof look at the responses to this comment point proven
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the origin of the stereotype i was thinking it was from watching like street performers performing in front of crowds and the black people would show their amazement very enthusiastically seems wholesome to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that book is straight fire love it i can relate to it nigha commentated my life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol where did he find these niggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe rbeetlejuicing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no i honestly didnt mean it like that im sorry if it came across like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oooooh whatd they say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we just dramatic af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats true my brothers gf believed in magic eggs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,driving tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they really are though asians have a hell of a work ethic i dont know a single asian who is mediocre at everything they always have one thing that theyre really good at the smartest guy i know is asian the best basketball player i know is asian the most athletic guy i know is asian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except those two in particular have been used in the past and still are to this day to pigeonhole people black people loving magic isnt to my knowledge used to do that unless you want to use it as evidence that black people are ignorant or simple
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the asians are good at school stereotype can lead to negative effects due to the model minority stereotype it isnt all that wholesome tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,asians are good at school and because of this stereotype you have tiger parents and people who treat you like a robot because of this stereotype you have white people treating you like a pet like some tool to shame other people of color why cant you be more like the asians they would say yet the people who say this probably dont have a single asian friend you also have people of color say your problems dont matter or dont even exist because youre basically white because of this stereotype people think all asians are rich educated and successful ignoring the poverty and crime in chinatowns even mentioning asian gangs illicits laughter because to most people asians are like good little androids who do nothing but solve math problems so what the hell do you mean by people get too touchyfeels and everything is offensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nowadays black people are enthusiastic and love to engage things like this i can actually totally see this being attributed loosely to black episcopal churches that part makes it a bit wholesome and heartwarming previously probably something about them being superstitious and easily amazed because theyre unsophisticated and uneducated thats why it would pose a problem and one cant reasonably doubt that some folks draw enjoyment from these sorts of clips and jokes out of that belief so as with all things related to race in america theres considerable baggage that needs to be respected
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see my post below pretty much sums it up sorry for not directly replying to you didnt notice till it was too late
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow that made me dizzy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aspiring actors will take anything they can get
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you deadass thought black people generally believe in ghosts my man what is you doin here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is why stereotypes in general are problematic positive stereotyping is still stereotyping and assholes will always find ways of using stereotypes against people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these dont sound like actual problems though people think youre rich but youre not what issues does this cause people are gonna stop being your friends when they find out you dont have money they arent your friends people think asian gangs arent tough who cares
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nowadays black people are enthusiastic and love to engage things like this i can actually totally see this being attributed loosely to black episcopal churches that part makes it a bit wholesome and heartwarming episcopal churches have nothing to do with it im not even sure why that would come to your mind or how it relates at all previously probably something about them being superstitious and easily amazed because theyre unsophisticated and uneducated thats why it would pose a problem and one cant reasonably doubt that some folks draw enjoyment from these sorts of clips and jokes out of that belief thats pretty much it as far as more modern stuff is concerned the whole thing is rooted in black are dumb and easily amazed its the reason its even funny when blackmoeople purposely over react to stuff but also it stems from the whole magical negro crap which has its roots at the beginning of the kkk the reason they wear those hoods and stuff is actually to try to look like ghosts cuz negros are afraid of ghost or so they think which itself comes from their misunderstanding of native african religions but its always been a trope in tons of movies the magical negro looking after a white family ect
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude you white af calm down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh deadass what is you doin here oof yeater please
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i am but that guy still stupid af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes got her priorities straight as uchauncii
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it honestly looks like a room someone just moved into when i moved the first night id set up a tv and a set of blankets on the floor and stream netflix no time to be unpacking boxes the first night
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know niggas that do this shit too get new shoes every month have some expensive ass clothes and they cant even afford sheets for their bed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thot af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she probably bought them out the back of a van
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if she was my girl id put the tv on her ass and watch football instead

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,either she stood on the couch to take an aerial photoshot and someone took a picture when she sat down to edit the shot or shes od horny and trying to calm her vag down with her heels because shes having wet flashbacks about that time she did the whole football squad i dunno
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at that smile trump has thats the smile of someone who is uncomfortable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like she was trying to keep her legs out of the shot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,old witch trying to get her sexy on for the men why is she texting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably the same couch monica was laying on when bill was rifling a cigar in her pussy

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so arthur is drakes ghostwriter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those kinda people that start their apologies im sorry that you dont even bother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess the no snitching policy isnt applied in the arthur universe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that copypasta feel like ive heard it before
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first of all fuck you sue ellen for makin me do this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry you made me lose my temper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is how my mom apologizes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this accurate af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dear sue ellen it was just a prank bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought we were friends classic line
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,brb watching arthur to find the next meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so actually washing my nuts off this time doesnt count as an apology gurl i picked up mcdonalds on the way home for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,need to put the chief keef shit on this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the ass was fat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont get me wrong i know this is a joke but even on a friend to friend basis this shit pisses me off if you do something dumb af and i tell you to fuck off saying i cant take a joke wont help shit i love it when they say ah your acting like a girlfriend ahh damnit i thought i was friends with someone who actually has had a legitimate relationship up til now

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ps no one likes a tattle tail

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,omg this had my fat ass in tears
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga thats francinenot sue ellen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the point in apologizing the next fight you guys have she will bring it up anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sometimes it really is just you needing to chill tf out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same letter can be used from a friend apologizing for being racist triggered yet nah you shouldnt be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but thats francine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in all honesty tho snitches get stitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,quit snitchin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arthur is a damn boss at this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when eminem read that letter from his biggest fan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my last relationship in a nutshell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow that shit hits too close to home theres one chick i wish i could send that to but id replace teacher with hr that shits too real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you just couldnt part with her arthur memes on good terms you just had to get the last word dank meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry that youre such a little bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only clicked on this link because i thought that it was a picture of pepe at first glance it is not and i am disappointed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch is not cute shes lucky she got half an apology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see no double standard tbh shit like this is everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess i need to learn how to apologize then cause i see nothin wrong with that letter someone educate me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so what hes right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats my shit when i didnt do anything wrong im sorry i got you upset not sorry for what i did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does it bother anyone else that that is not sue ellen but francine or did she find this letter or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if that feels harsh and unpleasant understand that this is the way guys are taught to communicate with each other the ones who cant handle it get their asses beat and dont get what they want in life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unfortunately theres no woman apologizing meme to respond with because they never fuckin do i fuck up i apologize she fucks up i apologize for making her feel bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this twoxchromosones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he admitted he was wrong and the girl still wont accept his apology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcompnwbnctjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is me when i get halfway through a paragraph long apology text then realize im not even sorry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah thats too mean and ruins the whole thing you just gotta give this nice heartfelt apology
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ugly anyway bih smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mattafact cut my motherfuckin oldies back on you killin my motherfuckin vibe

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ugly anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a joke not a dick dont take it so hard damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cant you take a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes a nosy ass bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,always noticed this too i assume sue ellen was just showing francine how bad arthur is at apologizing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i remember sue ellen read the letter got mad and threw it on the ground francine was nosey and picked it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so much this i thought i was the only one that noticed drakes pasdivr aggressive shit towards women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorryits just funny how
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a corporate letter we regret that you believe you had a negative experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see also schrödingers asshole he exists in a simultaneous quantum state of regret and pride depending on whether youre offended or amused at his offensive joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry you went and got your feelings hurt try not to do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or im sorry but starts ranting about why its your fault anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just like tmartn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry that you have such a terrible friend as me hmm checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry youre a lil bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have an ex that started his apology letter as this is my formal apology that guy was a nightmare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry that you have to deal with the consequences of my actions dont judge a book by the first four words
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets try it im sorry that you got offended when i refused to stand for the national anthem youre right the person shouldnt bother theyre just an asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she fucking roasts arthur at the ebd of the episode and does he snitch no motherfucker can take a roast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its actually directly wordforword
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there was another post with the same picture but it said white people apologizing for saying something racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first off fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,muufacka
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive read it times and im still tryna figure out whats wrong with it seems like a legit apology tbqh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit laughing at jokes but what about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you went to mcdonalds whats your girl even good for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dank and meta combo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn you people cant handle being the butt of a womans joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone knows whats up with an ass like that you be apologizing for shit you didnt even do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just cut them from your squad dude it sounds harsh but after dealing with someone for decades like that they never change its always someone elses problem and not theirs i am much happier without that person in my life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and them not being able to take insults back and getting all bitchy if you keep calling me transgender and making fun of me you cant get pissy if i act like an asshole to you and get your girlfriend to come and argue with me i must have argued for min his girlfriend kept saying thats how he acts and that i should just learn to take a joke and that he lost many friends that way like thats my fucking fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sound like a pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like i used to tell my wife i do not apologize unless i think im wrong and if you dont like it you can leave and i say the same thing to my current wife and ill say it to my next one too edit the quote was wronnng there was more wrong than just a comma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never apologize im sorry but thats just the way i am
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,francine reads it out loud to multiple people on the show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ikr not even apologizing to the right personsmh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dated my ex too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only if the first apology was as shitty as this one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you try the same shit she cries and tells you just to date someone else if she hurts you so much like how fucking immature and insensitive can you get
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol u wylin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh damn what happened fam dont tease us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its possible both memes can be true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he isnt really apologizing just lowkey putting the blame on her for getting offended a real apology would have been something like sorry for doing x wont happen again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just apologize dont try to imply they did something wrong by getting upset
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first of all nahh second of all who hurt u
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol its really not even if the guy was right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is fame bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i made this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you shop it with the silver surfer intermission lyrics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish i could give you gold for this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love that feeling of freedom like a warm ocean tide coming over you suddenly with absolute clarity you just know you dont give a single fuck and hit that delete button
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you were starting to apologise and still dont feel sorry those are the times when you absolutely should apologise its not about whether you feel sorry or not its about you recognising that you hurt someone elses feelings even if that doesnt matter to you itll make them feel a lot better about you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is me minutes after apologizing when its too late to really matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre excused bitch now fuck off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u must have me confused with mgllns stan that nigga need a saddle the way he ride his dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mind ya business francine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were getting to the bottom of this god damnit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah theyre discussing the letter with each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope she showed it to her and another girl personally at recess like can you believe this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not even close
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i ask how old you are there seem to be a bunch of people remembering details of a lot of episodes of arthur haha maybe im getting too old to remember specific details of my favorite cartoons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there personalities change as each episode needed but they were usually nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sweatpants hair tied chillin w no makeup on thats when you the prettiest i hope that you dont take that wrong well shoot i wasnt gonna until you brought it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so much this i thought i was the only one that noticed drakes pasdivr aggrfessvive shit towerads twomene lj by the way i was typing this how i thought you did with a really angry expression and typing so fast that you misspelled passive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be honest i dont even get why people like drake so much most of the songs arent even catchy which is generally the saving grace of most pop songs he just seems like he whines while sitting in a recording booth in a semi monotonous voice i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry you took it that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mistakes were made straight and to the point doesnt put the blame on anyone in particular but something bad definitely happened we just dont have enough research to point fingers yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont wanna look at anyones asshole sir
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we couldnt have possibly anticipated the emotions and reactions of human beings involved in this incident
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its the nonapology apology dont assign any particular blame to yourself and if you can try and turn the blame on the accuser
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit arthur is passive aggressive as fuck hes my new role model surprised he didnt end that shit with anyway i think theres something wrong with you i guess i forgive you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck happened to that show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,love how he got so mad he photoshopped a dog onto her face and sent it to her arthur is my savage role model
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arthur got savage af since i was a kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she even starts roasting him at the end of the episode smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that right there is the epitome of petty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck that two face buster for putting bitches before bros
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant believe i just watched a full episode of arthur in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn arthur a savage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha that is gold
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that product placement tho and include a gift certificate to crosswire motors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus whats up with that animation it didnt used to look like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man sue ellens a little bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey this show is better than i remember
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,west side when we ride come equipped with game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,instead of acknowledging he was at fault and empathizing with the recipient arthur pushes the blame onto sue ellen maybe youre overreactingi thought you could take a jokei dont understand why youre so upset his apology is not at all sincere and extremely passive aggresive a good apology is all about empathy sincerity and acknowledging the wrongdoing that youve committed regardless of the other partys actions hopefully you know this now and wont end up accidentally pissing off someone else in the future lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in the current year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,garlic bread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bob great movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats got to be just about the most tiring part of this sub sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gettin u more mcchickens when u run out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea thats what ive learned luckily i learned while i was young and i dont let people like that in my life anymore the best way to deal with it is to literally walk away no words if you are an idiot and tell me im wrong when im calling you an idiot you cant really argue with irrationality
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel you i worked with a guy that basically called me gay and said i get no pussy like every day and apparently it was too far when i insinuated the girls he fucked were fat in some kind of quantity over quality joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just grew up in a different environment i guess me and my friends roast each other down to the bone all the time we all have a good laugh because we dont care about whats said and at the end of the day were gonna still be there i learned quick that not everyone is like that ran into some people that got real offended
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,k
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sorta fucked the quote up but ima fuck witcha on an upvote anyways

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can click the give gold button
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what was honestly crazier to me is when i realized that with this girl i really did give a fuck like when you actually wanna accept fault for your role in the problem and learn from it so that next time you communicate better with her honestly i realized that i caught feelings for my current girl because we got in some mild disagreement and i realized that i didnt care about being right or wrong just making sure we were cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was beautiful fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or you hit send and wait for a response min later and you can tell she aint read any of it you watch the dots and suddenly your brain twitches all your regrets and everything that has lead to that moment where you wish you never met her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then you realize you miss the sex
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like a warm ocean tide coming over you wat where can you lay down and feel a warm ocean tide roll over you

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im but i have a toddler it all comes back around dude its not necessarily that people remember better theyve just seen it more recently
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dig

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry if you felt that i

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i forgive you for making me write this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,happens later on in the episode the kid doesnt give a fuck

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youll love him even more when he releases his diss track against francine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,motherfucker realizes he is being an asshole and just sends her an email making fun of her fucking roast king over here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rascendingkarma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how was that passive aggressive the point was that he tried to be nice apologizing when he felt he was in the right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no idea i remember watching the og episodes like years ago fav when arthur gets that infection from the landfill and we see his body literally at war
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,her face when she saw it lmao it should be a meme of its own like the wolverine one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,absolute cringe that was the episode where arthur hit chrischan levels of social ineptitude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats some real shit tho why would you tell the teacher instead of clapping back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stop calling me a sheepdog im moving schools i hate you i didnt over react you cant make fun of people oh qnd you look like a mouse my boi arthur didnt even look like a mouse but that motherfucker sue ellen straight up looked like a dog fuck whys that even offensive theyre all animals if i call a white kid hispanic am i a bully
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best bread toss some mixed blend walmart cheese on with garlic salt and some great value butter still delicious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,baby steps
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do people keep talking about heads when i wanted to talk about tails two sides of the same coin of course its going to get mentioned sorry you dont get to control the narrative i guess also its a joke and its kinda funny if youve really got a problem with that you need to relax alot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what do you need her for when you have the mcchicken
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is fine mutually joking around is fun as hell its when shit gets personal the one friend that inspired that comment was because if i told him something personal to me next week someone who i was semiclose with but i didnt tell would know i wonder who told them also they like to bring it up in group convos as part of that teasing initiation to loosen up the mood all you are doing by doing that is being pretentious trying to make someone look stupid and looking to piss someone off if you consider yourself a friend you should be able to understand what i dont want being told never knew how coldhearted the guy was until after i told him i dont want shit to do with him anymore he started a rumor that i killed my dog so far ive heard drownedpoured boiling waterhit with bat i have never owned a dog
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit i knew i should have put that comma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if they are wrong for acting the way they did just bc you got feelings dont mean those feelings are right or important or the world owes you shit for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those like chickens from scotland or some shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ur a legend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the god
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at money mcgoldey diamonds over here with his pool of gold coins and tree that grows money jk fam yeah you broke mother fucker that shit is like a few bucks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,show me an example
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then you get drunk off that henny text your ex telling her your happy for her in her life and your sorry for the mistakes you pass out because drunk wake up to text talking about how you owe her money and you aint shit and never gunna be shit and then she says ya dick little like damn bitch i was just tryna aplogize you aint got the juice like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aww our little joey is getting so big that sounded a lot more patronizing than i meant it to sorry seriously though good on you for realizing that being right isnt nearly as important as understanding and having empathy for the other persons perspective i never had a relationship go anywhere close to right until i figured this out im currently in one i have exactly zero issues with and i never would have thought that was possible five years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha yeah i did that too for everything oh you cheated on me and are telling me its somehow my fault oh youre right i love you so much i just want everything to be alright it started out with taking the blame for little things that werent my fault just wanting us to be coolnot caring if i stood up for myself or not and legitimately got there sometimes i honestly dont think she would have cheated on me if she had respected me more and didnt think she could easily make me feel like it was my fault just be careful bro is all im saying edit just to clarify im not with her anymore she left me for her best friend who i knew she was sleeping in his bed and staying nights at place but i was told i wasnt trusting her by being skeptical of those things yep this was after she cheated on me with a different guy she then had so little respect for me she couldnt understand why i wouldnt want to remain in her life as a friend because she didnt want to lose someone she had talked to every day for four years thats when i called her an evil bitch and told her to fuck off after i found out she was fucking said best friend a day after we broke up and most likely before because she sent a snap of her with him to her ex best girl friend telling her she was going to fuck him who happend to also be that guys ex tldr my ex was a massive bitch that let me take the blame for everything fuck girls im still not okay plz help
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the gayest shit ive ever heard

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have you heard about chris today
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit when was this episode made smooth animation looks fucking weird with this artstyle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man what a sensitive bitch cant take a fucking roast and starts crying and shit then at the end when arthur apologizes fucking sheepdog over here starts making fun of arthur who realizes its a damn joke and laughs what a little bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats cool dont know why i got downvoted for asking an age to see if my memory is fucked haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what about saying you were right youre always so level headed you mean the world to me i have a lot to learn from you i love you etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i apologize if certain people were offended by this one is used so often these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh uhwe fightin now im sorry you feel that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arthur is fucking savage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new copypasta
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drawing is animation but i know what youre saying heres an explanation apparently some behindthescenes drama has led to arthur switching from cookie jar entertainment to story entertainment for season and this new studio uses flashbased techniques instead of the traditional approach that bore the show through its infancy i think cookie jar went out of business following fraud charges or some such a real shame
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good god this new animation is such an assault to the eyeballs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know what you mean but your terminology is wrong theyre both animated obviously the old arthur was traditionally animated which is what you mean this new show uses limited computer animation like many modern cartoons it was probably made in flash or toonboom its normal for shows to be made in software now but the limited animation style is what gives it that cheap stilted look there are plenty of shows out that use digital animation that look awesome this isnt one of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its been on for years and years on pbs you can watch a few seasons on netflix
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah man this looks like shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry your such a little snitch who cant take a roast sincerely arthur how is that not passive aggressive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sure that wasnt magic school bus that sounds like some ms frizzle shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you guys remember a lot of arthur episodes from your childhood i guess i remember a couple doug and rockos modern life episodes but only vaguely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sailing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo i dont know who hurt you but im not them i simply agreed with a mod comment it looks like youre the one that needs to relax because youre carrying baggage and looking to toss it at people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so u dont have to drive to the golden arches when ur hands are covered in your special mayo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you do sound like a pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then talk to them about it directly instead of pulling this passive aggressive fauxapology shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you dont care about the persons feelings just dont apologize at all then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus aint got nothin to do with puttin ya dick in a sammich
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you too can aspire to make minimum wage fuck the university of phoenix im down with everest nigga everest nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you tried
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,example
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol you good bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u ever crash ya girls car and break up wit her just so u dont have to pay for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bad day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,manto close to home
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im amazed that so many people have the need to be right about stuff why care so much does it hurt that bad to admit you might be wrong serious question
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ay thats great hope yall keep it up for a long time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but is the ass fat doe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what feels really great is being able to tell when you should apologize and when you should just have fucks i was once with this girl that would genuinely be mad at me if i was out with a friend for a few hours without telling her we werent living together or anything i would profusely apologize and go total bitch mode time for a few days it felt amazing to realize that im a human too and can tell people like that to fuck off its all about that balance of empathy and selfrespect
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont let one shitty girl get you down on all girls there are lots of awesome girls out there who would never cheat you might have to cast a wider net or consider different types than you normally would but i promise we are out there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn dude thats fuckin shitty ive been cheated on too so i know how it feels but dont let this sour your perception of all girls most of them wouldnt do that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ohhh i didnt get that rbn was raised by narcissists haha yeah i know of that sub but now im definitely subscribing due to your description of text battles i just read a few of the top posts of all time the number top post is awesome also i figured nparent meant narcissist parent but what does eparent mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,voices are weird too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea whats with the animation is this show still getting made
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people get defensive about arthur
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arthur is sacred
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stick with i statements as much as possible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reminds me of nixons presidential pardon have granted and by these presents do grant a full free and absolute pardon unto richard nixon for all offenses against the united states which he richard nixon has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from january through august
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shopped a dog onto her head this man just called her a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that new animation looks trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes it is i meant computer generated rather than whats usually multiple stills with some meshing involved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til arthur is still actually on tv
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well it looks like shit compared to how it was years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that explains why the voices are so different now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait the real story here is that arthur has seasons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont understand how south parks animation can be created in a few days but family guys takes like months for each episode i mean south park is more crude and simplistic looking but family guy isnt the most advanced cartoon either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because its not passive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rugrats did it too it was like the meme amongst cartoons in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah he went to the dumps and cut himself on a can of spaghettios or some shit and had to go the doctor because his weak ass didnt have any antibodies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember the one where he finally clocks out dw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt have cable and my parents were suspicious of programs not on pbs so yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was a pretty stupid criticism its a joke on the flip side of the coin not a whataboutism love the trolling though thats some agrade unfounded provocation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like holding the special sauce in my mouth and then blowing bubbles with it really covers your pallete
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean you can care about a persons feelings but not the specific feelings that are stupid af and may be irrationalwrong in a given situation i can love someone but if theyre being a blatant hypocrite then ill try to assuage their hurting but also explain why they might be in the wrong here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a damn good sandwich though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dicks out of sandwiches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a bold move cotton lets see if it pays off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao if i was rich or smt i would gild everyone around him to piss him off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sheshejust didnt have the juicelike that ya know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep she got paid out on a dollar car was rushing back to her place cause i heard from a friend she was meeting up with a dude and she wasnt tryna tell me about it crashed that motherfucker sooooo hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im amazed that so many people have the need to be right about stuff why care so much does it hurt that bad to admit you might be wrong serious question tbh with you im a fairly emotionally divorced person which believe it or not can be beneficial in that i wont argue a point im incorrect on ive got nothing invested in my conclusion so if you have a better answer or can show me why im wrong im absolutely agreeable with that however if im not wrong being emotionally divorced can be a detractor because it doesnt offend me to debate the issue and i wont understand why theyre getting upset been around the block a few times but making it stick is tough when you wont give up to make the other happy because you dont pick up on the cue that tells you thats what they want
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arguments are rarely about whos right or wrong its the lack of empathy behind it a dude may be right but if hes willing to trample my feelings in the process that raises a lot of questions whether he meant it or not it usually doesnt end well i shouldnt have to argue why my feelings are upset if he mentions or reminisces about some former tight year old gf if he doesnt get why its in bad taste im gonna forget that hes not in the friend zone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it depends i dont mind admitting im wrong when im wrong although it can be hard and sometimes embarrassing but i wont back down if i know im right about something that i think has real world implications for example if im arguing with an antivaxxer im not going to back down but it wont be because i want to be right its because i am right and what theyre perpetuating is harmful to actual people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it depends on how the person views being wrong is being wrong a good thing or a bad thing my dad hates being wrong and when i was growing up he would get defensive if i tried to correct him on anything sometimes he would get angry sometimes he would lie just to avoid admitting he was wrong so i grew up with the idea that being wrong about something was a bad and shameful thing when i was wrong i cried i felt embarrassed if you believe being wrong bad it does hurt to be wrong the truth that its not a shameful thing theres nothing bad about it but some people dont believe that i think thats part of the problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf they didnt say you couldnt be both just that being right isnt nearly as important that being said if i am right and you do me bad then like hell am i apologising it just reinforces such conflict inducing behaviour learned that the hard way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if i told you no one has suggested otherwise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be honest it kind of has but its probably my own fault cant a get a date to save my own life right now girls straight up say they want to hang out never ever text me again not like im viciously chasing them down for it im just like oh cool yeah lets hang out again im just tired of it man and i still miss that bitch way too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nparent is the narcissist eparent is the enabler
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats pretty funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sweet thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i were right i always so level headed i mean the world to me i have a lot to learn from me i love me etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he just dogged her nog
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its much easier to make though so it probably saves them a lot of time and money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it has to be in its season i remember watching it as a kid in the early to mid started in seems about right i find it amazing they can continously come up with educational and well thought out kids shows every year it seems like writing for an adult cartoon would be much easier then again you could keep writing the same episodes over and over again just slightly different so kids dont notice haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that and child actors voices tend to change over the course of years so they have to get new ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i had to guess its cause south park uses a lot of basic shapes everyones eyes are the same as are the body shapes for similar ages and genders the only thing different is the small details like hair color and clothing which wouldnt take long to draw they probably have a bank for shit like clocks pictures lamps etc that they can add to the background images they use
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,culminating in the magnum opus osmosis jones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i told you not to touch iiiiiittttt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol dude bringing up the flip side of the coin as a defense to criticism is the definition of whataboutism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude responds to me first accuses me of trying to control the narrative tells me i need to relax a lot dude tries to claim i am trolling k edit you know the mod was the one who criticised your joke right its pretty clear from this thread that you seem to think they are the same person as i because i literally never said anything about your joke in particular
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you think they are being hypocritical then dont pull this passive aggressive apology thing talk to them about itcivilly i understand why that bothered you but im also really frustrated because you do the same thing etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i want a nut button like one of those easy buttons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit this gonna be my new desktop background thank you fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the dude didnt even nut 🙌
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah man thats like dollar watch out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who hurt you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mah nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds about right some people cant separate themselves from their thoughts so if you criticize their idea they feel personally insulted regardless of how you do it i hate it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reminisces about some former tight year old gf yikes thats pretty ridiculous i know plenty of guys that reminisce about ex girlfriends with their guy friends but to his girlfriend what the fuck and what i meant about needing to be right was more related to facts and predictions not really about emotional arguments does your boyfriend think he was in the right about mentioning the tightness of his ex to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this feels uncomfortably specific
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to me its a losing battle and not worth the energy to argue with someone who didnt use logic or reason to get their position
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre apologizing for being wrong chances are youre apologizing for being subjectively wrong not objectively of course you shouldnt apologize if youre not factually incorrect unfortunately altercations within relationships are rarely so black and white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i understand im at a similar place but im too fucked up to seek out any new girls although my ex is fucking anything with a dick i hopr things get better for you dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh word i meant narcissistic not natural haha enabler meaning one parent enables the other to be a narcissist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like kanye lyrics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it started production in but didnt air til its at seasons aired but renewed through
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i get that i just dont see how family guy takes so long i also have always wondered if the south korean animators often wonder what the fuck theyre making fun of when they have to animate the characters to the voices haha theyre probably thinking that this is the dumbest and weirdest show ever created
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see thats what you dont seem to be getting im not defending anybody i wasnt like haha women apologize bad too so its ok when men do im just making a joke about the way women apologize since all people suck at it and it was germane to this particular original joke go on though go on forever and ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude does thing dude does other unrelated thing k
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have you ever done anything like this before
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from now on im orderin my mcchickens without mayo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,itt you killin it all your comments got me crackin up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i actually have that exact same couch in my houseonly mine has loads more semen on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont exactly have quid laying around do i
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn dude he already said who earlier keep up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and they dont realize how unproductive it is so frustrating wed have fixed the problem by now if we could just discuss it reasonably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes not a bf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hehe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok ok ok ok ok ok
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,south park is mostly topical to current issues so the story builds faster with their team of writers family guy has to go through the same storyboarding process that every other cartoon does which can take monthsbecause they do the whole season at once
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that what they say because i thought everyone watched without the sound 😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,goin in dry huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what it smell like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when recycling old jokes goes wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arthur sure was a great show

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes not entirely wrong though i know a lot of asian countries have squat toliets so they spend a lot of time using the muscles involved with squatting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,squatting to poop is way more efficient for your body so they probably spend a lot less time doing it than we do

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here i go againeh whatever now remember this doesnt apply to all women sometimes its just because they dont know what to say you might have said some outlandish shit or just something clever that she hasnt come up with a response for and then there are the usual human reasons she read it but doesnt have time to respond and maybe forgot about it later

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im getting old juvenile off top
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love this site lmao this has been a joke for so long and its still gold
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,butthurt ny niggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets not forget lugz for ny niggas on a budget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that headline isnt correct shes in jail right now her probation is being forced to live in a group home for young girls with mental disorders but shes still in jail because shes so messed up that no group home wants to take her so that headline is misleading because her probation is not like a typical persons probation shell have no freedom and shes she constantly monitored so its sort of like a jail for mentally disturbed people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure but drive across the atlantic coast to nyc in order to stab one black person and all of a sudden youre a racist terrorist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont lie if this was a man hed be doing life in prison
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry officer i didnt know i couldnt do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,baby just needed some air
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck is her thought process
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like a select few can comment on these posts before you know what happens and cant nobody have racial discourse cause white fragility is real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she didnt try assaulting a cop yet that usually works if ive learned anything from bpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,smfh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anyone else thinks shes attractive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for the backstory to many people just take headlines as the entire deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean thats some commitment right there maybe we should give him a medal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no different situation than any other teen pregnancy did you google the case yet mom did not tell her to do it that is a lie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes he would but only because mothers who just gave birth cant be held accountable for their actions at least in my country there us no punishment for mothers in the few days folowind the birth beacouse of the state theyre in the same psychological chainges that lead to postpartum depression later can also manifest as psychosis earlierits not as simple as you make it out to be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im tryna get rid of this baby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she was going trough psychosis when she killed the baby the headline is super misleading because it fails to mention that her probation is being forced to live in a group home for mentally disturbed young women as opposed to prison but shes actually in jail right now because shes so deranged that no group home wants her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apparently shes a minor is a super fucked up household she didnt know she was pregnanther parents told her to do itetc she took an insanity plea and has been removed from her parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from what bpt has taught me being in the peripheral of a cop usually gets you arrested
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you didnt learn anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes like bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i looked up the case i cant find anything about what udmking said so yea i guess facts dont matter we just gonna believe him because its the top comment lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if your wig gets split on some third eye shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for those who want to read investigators told kptm that lopez gave birth to a premature baby in september at her apartment police say lopez threw the baby out of the secondstory window before telling her mother officials say lopezs mother tried to give the baby cpr but the infant died at a nearby hospital so udmking why would the mother go out and perform cpr if she told the girl to throw the baby out of the window has more information lopez gave birth to a girl in september at home inside the kellom knolls complex shortly after she threw the baby out of her secondfloor window and quickly told her mother what she did deputy douglas county attorney jennifer chrystalclark asked that lopez be placed in a group home due to comments the teen made that indicate she didnt understand the severity of her actions lopezs defense lawyer rebecca mcclung disagrees only which is saying the mother told her to throw the baby out the window is nydailynews and we already know that news organization isnt reliable which gives some information which she knew the consequences of her actions dailymail isnt reliable in my eyes either so take this with a grain of salt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,must deactivate her facebook account oh heavens the judges punishments knows no boundaries
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean to be fair i doubt her mom was like hey honey wanna throw jaiydién out the window and she said bet with these cases theres usually a mental disorder stemming from a long history of physical and mental abuse now whether this is an excuse or not is a whole nother debating point thats really up to your own personal opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair see how the guy below you said that lol i feel like every bpt thread turns into to be fair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mother never said that anyways google the case
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not to disagree but a good defense attorney would point out a breach of trust potentially from her mother they could argue she wasnt old enough to fully understand the situation she was in etc etc just saying that we dont know the nature of her relationship with the mother or what pressures she had and what was said by the mother necessarily i dont think its as black and white as teen throws baby out window and avoids jail white privilage strikes again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she got the insanity pleading iirc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah man this sub is oppressing white people and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know that you can block rblackpeopletwitter with res instead of coming here and getting butthurt right majority of your comments here are stop making fun of white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apparently this baby got tossed within minutes of being born to a teenage girl teenagers are already fucked in the head then you add one of the most traumatic experiences a human can go through the probation sentence begins to make more sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you ever see that video of that dude who ran off from a few cops and got tazed and went missing for a week or two and it turns out he was living in his moms basement and she went on tv trying to shame cops for killing her son
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what about a little black kid who grew up with gangbangers for parents and they slowly brainwashed him all his life and then got him to shoot someone when he was a teen you think hed get probation and would the discussion be about his mental health
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me hoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did i point the finger at any race i am simply pointing out the disparity in how society treats black and white people that is the discussion that needs to be had and we need solutions they want to divide americans and create dissent for the massive amount of attention it garners them and theyll do all they can to keep this narrative going the only divide created by having this discussion is between those who agree that the problem exists and that it needs to be fixed and those that dont if you agree the problem exists you should be making this plea to those that dont dropping this narrative is just ignoring the problem and hoping it goes away im white and this aggressive meme doesnt make me feel divided and i dont feel like anyone is pointing the finger at me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and yall are playing into the medias hands fucking idiot did reddit teach you this rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the issue in this case is the disparity in treatment between blacks and whites in the justice system if you dont believe it exists then yes i believe you are either ignorant or dont care what is the flaw that you can point out in this argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bros before hoes is stupid man ya gotta maintain your homiehoestasis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my boys wife call me once and asked what pool hall you at i said im asleep in my bed whaddya mean she said cool and hung up an hour later my boy calls me and goes hey if my wife ask we at tables™ moral of the story is dont have me tied to bad lies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this sub should make all titles for reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is fine as long as you dont expect your boy to back you up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats when you better shut the fuck up she will forgive his stupid ass eventually but she will shade the shit outta you forever can never shoot yo shot at her friends you get skipped on the cookout invites she gonna refer to you as his stupid ass homeboy forever its never worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its even the same exact face you pull when this happens
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell him that shit after the fact gotta back your bro up in the moment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you better provide that man some back up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it depends on what they arguing about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats when you pretend someone called you n tell them that you gotta go but on the way out you feel like youre forgetting something then you get into the car only realizing now that you left your car keys but you dont wanna go back into the awkwardness so you just walk home then around pm your boy ask if you good n if everythings ok n you just reply with a ye but really it isnt not at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude for real i find myself saying i dont know fool she kinda got a point way more than id like to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,point or not you go down with your boy till the end
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and you already fd her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont care if u got hoes in the dorm when she outside the door and u tell her to leave i got ur back homie this meme sus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fr we need to make the mods see this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,amazing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every time im in other subs and i see a title thats absolute shit i check the comments to see if everyones roasting it and then i remember that not everywhere is like this sub lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess you havent seen the shitty ones here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn this hits close
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have no use for my friends girlfriend if we dont get along if my buddy is looking for help im gonna help him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love my boy but sometimes he sayin some real stupid shit i dont want my name tied to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck him hes dead weight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if your homie says the earth is flat and looking for you to back him up youd do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically it means you got to keep your homie and ho relationships in balance with each other or in homiehoestasis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at some point its messed up to bring me into it i cant have his girl mad at me when im trying to get with her friend via her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats fair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats why once you see that shit coming you just pull out your phone and start being to distracted what i wasnt paying attention run that back again i dont think i understand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why twice tho dont you think one time is enough for that poor dude to be roasted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you not wrong not wrong at all

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gonna be real fucked up if they find out how to make people live forever and my ass is years old
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cnn are idiots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the world would die out immediately were already in trouble with overpopulation and machines replacing people for jobs could you imagine how hard that would be on the economy wed be purging every months
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dying brings us together ❤️
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do colons work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id love to live a long time and all but our parents and others if you dont love your parents would be dead for longer not actually but from our pov sorta if you catch my drift so that would suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i find comfort in knowing this shit wont last forever gladly miss me with this shitshow thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is white people twitter or rmeirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they may not have to die but they certainly need to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a fake article right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that would be pretty sick but im pretty sure it wont be widely available and only a few select few will be able to live forever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does anyone actually want to live forever dont get me wrong im happy with my life and will miss people when they pass but i cant imagine people living forever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alright so the idea behind this movement is the premise that old age is a disease damage that has been accumulated just by living so scientist who study gerontology the study of old age are trying to engineer a way to reverse the aging of our cells and keep us youthful explains it way better than me since im just a regular college student who had an existential crisis after finishing witcher and did some research because i couldnt sleep at night due to the overwhelming fear of my own death but basically if and when this technology becomes available to the populace there will be a way to reverse your aging and make you young again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean i dont think they can prevent you from ageing though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty much like whenever any mainstream news site picks up a scientific discovery theyll take a one sentence blurb in the future implications section of a research article and blow it out of proportion then people will complain about how theres a new cancer cure discovered every week
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont be mean to the mentally challenged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,news
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thered probably be a queue to have a baby once someone decided to die the next couple in line could have a baby or make it so to have a baby you need a license and make it cost a lot of money there could even be a baby black market
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,contrary to popular belief the world is not over populated you could currently fit the whole worlds population in texas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this probably isnt the subreddit to talk about this but i really do think so its what connects just about every living thing not even necessarily total death some organisms dont die of old age but cell death definitely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha dying of laughter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its written like a script you doofus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,glad someone else noticed these tumblr posts lately are wack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really depends if the quality of the world is successful in improvements on all fronts such as technologyhealth society etc i wouldnt mind living forever and experiencing it but if the quality of the world is some fallout dead type of shit i rather be dead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well shit we got two choices then stay the same age forever or get a sweet ass robot body either way i think we will be fine i mean as long as you were born in the and up youll be fine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i swear everyone who finishes the witcher has an existential crisis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did some research because i couldnt sleep at night due to the overwhelming fear of my own death this is some real relatable shit dude i swear to god i have a fucking panic attack almost nightly because of that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do we still have the option to die tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,importantly the way de grey thinks this will happen is that well find a cure to one aspect of aging which will keep people alive long enough to find another cure and some of them will be alive long enough to find the next cure etc eventually aging will be totally destroyed and someone alive today might be around to experience it but it isnt that aging is going to be completely figured out and taken care of in a normal human lifetime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you get that existential crisis when you were young too i never talked about it with anyone but i remember feeling like i was in a crazy deep pit of despair i hadnt felt before thinking about inevitable death when i was like around or but i could be off on the age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i want to die eventually just not for the next years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or just go through the trial of grasses and live years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so i guess were going to go full cabot house on our asses might as well add power armour to the mix we already have pip boys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if nobody dies its going to get real uncomfortable real quick on this planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why the fuck would anyone want to live forever though fuuuuuck that gimme and im fucking good i aint sticking around any longer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i read the last part as black baby market
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most of what youre describing was captured in for anyone interested vonnegut is woke af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or if you want to have a baby you have to guarantee that you dont live forever so after some years when you die because of a natural death or something your baby takes your place in the world and till you die there is just some overpopulation that will resolve itself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thatd be an ethical conundrum for religious people if you want to die to go to heaven isnt that considered suicide so you cant go to heaven but they also said you dont have to die which means you can still die in some ways just not of old age maybe a religious person hires an assassin for ten years from today and somehow manages to forget it then boom headshot would that still be considered suicide
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it has nothing to do with the space we can live in but about the resources we have to support all the lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i disagree i find more deep dark relatable shit on this sub than i do in a lot of other places to be honest i feel like we really connect through our struggles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no its written poorly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obviously all this is still theoretical and it will require extensive research and testing before it becomes available to the public then there are a whole host of problems when this becomes made to the public aubrey de grey estimates itll be available in like years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as someone whos going to hit in weekseat a dick babies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only kids will remember everything after the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was born in am i good edit dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was hard not to have one lol the story was so emotional and so immersive that i felt like a part of me died in a strange way the idea that such an amazing story was over and buried hit me in a way that i never felt before not to sound emo or anything but when the end credits rolled and i saw what happened to all the characters i met and did cool shit with hit me me like a ton of bricks like its over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was sad to realize that it would be a long damn time before i played another game anywhere near that good best thing ive played all year was blood and wine so you can see i was right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just really want to live long enough to actually explore space i dont wanna die on this dusty ass planet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember feeling that when i was like or something i couldnt sleep because i think someone in my favorite comic or something died i cant remember it was years ago the idea of justnot existing terrified the shit out of me my family isnt religious so all i knew was that the alternative to life was nothing and that scared the shit out of me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i imagine that will be one of the slew of ethical issues that will arise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont want to die period i understand the ramifications of choosing that like everyone i know and love will probably die but the allure of just staying alive and experiencing everything that will happen for hundreds of years to come is too much i want to see everything this universe has to offer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but then everybody would call me a mutant and my feelings would get hurt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive read a book on this but couldnt remember what the title is basically everyone took a drug that let you live forever but in order to get the drug you had to pledge to not have kids if you do have kids and the govnt finds out either you or they die
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty much humans are shitty and cant allocate resources
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not saying its the only thing just one of the more significant ones perhaps
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still pretty damn good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hmm that leaves me time to get rich enough to use this maybe if i eat ramen and crackers for the next years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,please not you too everyone already hates us because millenials is a funner word to say than generations xers ever was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right there with you but if the time frame was actually right wed be not terrible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga you gonna die
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no you bish you going to be dead with yo erectile dysfunction having get off my lawn looking headass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably if you stay healthy enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hell yeah ya bish better get your herbal tea and yoga on before you end up like stan lee instead of patrick stewart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is like a kinda sad kinda exhausted feeling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everything must die either way even the universe you want to experience the heat death of the universe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like a decent tradeoff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not going to happen in years problems are way too fundamental
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,diversify ya bonds nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were millennial yo just the older ones gen xers are like in their forties and early fifties these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if ending wasnt so bad i would have felt that way but bioware has a terrible way of writing very contrived endings to try and wrap up the story i was really into dai and then i hit the final boss and i was just let down by how easy it was i hoping mea is better but i dont have high hopes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lethargic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depression
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its better than dying some mundane death you get to see the end of the universe whats a better way to go than that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i think thats kind of a ridiculous assessment considering how fast new technology is developed hasnt the development of better technology always been exponential
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you bank at wu tang financial too my man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with your family by your side in a hospital bead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were not talking about making cell phones here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt matter at the rate were at right now unless they drop the bomb or kill us all we are growing and creating at a rate that will accelerate and you eventually will be in your old age and marvel at how advanced everything is even in years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obviously there is a lot of potential in science now though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the sound of one hand clappin

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when you bring refreshecola to a party set it on a table and notice a box of cocacola right next to it might not be the most edgy metaphor but it gets the job done i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont even look alike
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,errbody got that one keith sweatsteve harvey lookin ncle wit the old ass suit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the steve harvey you order online from a halloween website months in advance vs the dollar tree steve harvey you buy the day before halloween

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes the rc cola of steve harveys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,great value steve harvey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is he wearing normal length suits all of a sudden
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i fucking hate those commercials limitless data if it was truly limitless people would be able to watch all the vids they want without fear of hitting some data caps all at speeds faster than the shitty neveratasadvertised mbps dsl connections in most of the countrys rural areas while being able to tether your phone without any limits on what you can do with it any time any where yes i understand how much load cell users can put on a tower but if you cant resolve such issues as part of your upgrades then perhaps your network isnt so limitless as you advertise rant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit im never early enough to the comment s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at all bugs me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all black people look alike
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fucking tmobile
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,verizon doesnt offer any form of limitless but they use it as a key point of attack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shoulda put keenan from snl in there for reference purposes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here ya go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,appreciate it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats worth of electricity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how the fuck that shit stay up hope
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think thats cardi b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats with her shoes are those leg warmers or is it part of the shoe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it looks like she took the picture in the kitchen demo space of lowes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna need yall to do me a favor and let me know who this chick is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is the fridge even open
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its all fun and games until somebody takes her sandwich
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch looks like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on a serious note should her man be worried about her going out dressed like that asking for a friend 👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whenever i would waste electricity or water and my dad would call me out on it i would be a smart ass and say its like cents of electricity dad he would always put out his hand and say give me cents and then i would look like the dumb kid i am when i realized he was right and nobody will give you money for nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,double sided fashion tape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibonecorsetry maybe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,implants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cardi who
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wowwwwww she has never looked that good to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slouch boots but she could be wearing stilettos leg warmers of the same color
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol it really fucking does
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cardi b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scroll down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but the freezer is though and thats an even worse offense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would you pick the ugliest manliest depiction of wonder woman to compare to this fine specimen in the op
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that looks like a trans evangeline lily
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how a woman dresses has very little to do with whether or not she is faithful if she starts dressing different be a little concerned but if thats how she always dressed going out its all good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly thats cardi b she could probably beat a nigga ass with the switfness
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i believe its all about your comfort and couples should respect each other if one isnt okay with something if shes always dressed that way then clearly its what you were attracted too otherwise if its a new thing then yea small cause for concern i mean would your girl be okay if you suddenly starting going out with your penis showing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo im using that when i have kids thanks for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fashion tape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the correct answer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,her instagram which this is from has a bunch of pics of her looking fine as hell brah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why tf is it made by carlos santana
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hell yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cardi b really aint that fine she got a body but got no face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so if she starts wearing less and going out more i should be worried
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even then dont go overboard just politely ask her whats up it probably isnt worth getting riled up over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless you met her when she was out like that and her man didnt worry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bronx hoes my guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok b whos the woman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,na you know what it is i dont like the plastic look the fake tits and ass arent appealing to me plus httpswwwinstagramcompbndphwyhpim in this pic i love her hair i love the coy look on her face the make up is on point the titties look yummy waist and hips are crazy but its all an illusion natural beauty is where its at
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its made by httpsenwikipediaorgwikicaleres carlos santana is just there to get a check for his charity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes a low budget version of nicki
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,precisely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be honest being in a secure and healthy relationship boosts my selfimage when you have an so that makes you feel beautiful you might start taking more pride in how you look so yeah asking is a good idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,facts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deadass thats cardi b b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was a very nice comment to read
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn b i heard you the first time b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,locked because salt exceeds that of a collapsed bolivian salt mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some girl cried after i called her basic at a house party when she tried to get me to follow her on ig lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im white and i dont care when others comment on me being white like hell yeah im white its great — but ill be honest the white people cant cook jokes get me where it hurts i can cook
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im whiter than a polar bear in a blizzard drinking a pumpkin spice lattebut id never say some shit like that to someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the people complaining about sjws and pc culture seem like the first to get salty over white jokes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cmon boys all aboard on the 🚈🔑locked train🔑🚈
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whypipo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally most of reddit i wouldnt even be surprised if it turned up in this specific thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what kinda whiny ass white people are yall hanging with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most of trump supporters in a nutshell omg muslims need to be stopped so we can figure out what is going on should we do the same with cops killing blacks thats not the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as i white person this is the first ive heard of people getting offended by being called so white how is this offensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant lie for some reason it annoys me when someone says to me haha youre so white whenever i do something out the ordinary just cuz i have an accent doesnt make me not like a pumpkin cappuccino from my local coffee shop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,call a white person racist tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i stutter and say this yyyyou rite
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,real shi i got in on it on a facebook article about people talking shit about blm saying if black people cared for their community black men cared for their children and women blah blah blah then they can say their lives matter and i just pointed out thats bullshit people shouldnt be killed by their police no matter how the circumstances are and that its hard for some of the shit theyre saying because theres alot stacked and then comments all about playing the victime and one bout i shit you not obanana and a race war
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i must hang out around really normal white people i never see them get triggered when someone tries firing back or hell they usually dont talk crap in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do people actually refer to themselves as poc theres semantically no difference from just saying colored person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this looks exactly like the type of bitch i dont fuck with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically my entire family
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am pretty damn white how dare you remind me that you are genetically cooler than me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the race baiting is reaching whole new levels here recently

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am cherokee
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what would happen if you responded with well youre so black
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly never seen any white person do this we have it too good to care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never thought about it like this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfaoo im dead

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,locked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,umglln in your spare time go on imgur and search slavery or black people or blm i used to like imgur but now i find it kind of funny but i find it kind lame the posts that insult black people are the ones that gather fame such a sad website
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh boy cant wait for this thread to get locked

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if someone told me youre so white id take it as a compliment edit lol triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im white i rarely hear a youre so white or thats the whitest thing ever that i didnt think was funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how dare you challenge the structural integrity of the bubble she lives in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clearly she was acidic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least she didnt throw the cup of hot psl in your face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some white girl flipped me off yesterday cause i thought her face paint was chewbacca and then her friends came over threatening to break my glasses punch my face and kick me out she was a fucking owl fuckin white girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what her ig tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in her defense thats a pretty rude response by you even if she cried like a little bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my mom is a great cook that said i hope i marry a latin woman so she can make some authentic shit this new generation of white girls cant cook i can tell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the only one i take offense to my spice cabinet has spilled out into an additional spice rack on the counter that has spices around it i use a lot of shit man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you have a tan you can ignore the cooking jokes and claim an ethnicity that doesnt live off potatoes and beans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt even know that was a stereotype
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no you cant hett no you cant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so youre one of the good ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,would that polar bear be wearing an infinity scarf and ugg boots because that would be pretty white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,normal adjusted people dont usually say these things
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,polar bears have black skin though they basically old dark skins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so pretty much the avg redditor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you could almost say they get triggered easily
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rcringeanarchy was triggered by this meme they are literally doing exactly what yall predicted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive also noticed that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre gop grumpy old people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doubly ironic because the grievances raised by sjws and pc culture are more or less legitimate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the sjw dont get salty because they all have white guilt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this whole social justice warriors and political correct culture is so annoying and alien to me im originally not from america so i dont know what its all about but on reddit it is fucking everywhere sjws this pc culture that transgender this safe space that what the fuck i mean whats the problem here and why is it especially prevalent on reddit it seems like so many people are obsessed with this topic and now it feels like it has become a real circlejerk who can enlighten me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never noticed that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should see how salty they get when you crack black jokes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im ready bois 😎🍻
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mod posted this he knew exactly what he was doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,🍿 popcorn on the house 🍿
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love these threads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i made it on time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look around and be not surprised
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im proud of you for spawning that many removed comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aka rblackpeopletwitter whenever a school shooter joke is submitted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,another fun thing to do is to tell white people i cant believe more than half of yall are voting for trump
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf kind of logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,technically a strawman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when people say youre so white they only mean it in a negative way usually meaning youre lame or uncool or something along the lines of that i cant think of a scenario where somebody would say youre so white as a compliment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white people get uncomfortable when you talk about race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah id someone calls me white im just like lmao hell yeah im white im whiter than mayonnaise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe its just because of my circle of friends but i always see this shit during the world cup my grandfather on my moms side was italian so go italy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahaha youre so white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,high key white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats so white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can attest that it happens in real life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,should we stop talking about racism because it makes you feel uncomfortable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you have to acknowledge the issue in order to fix it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white people they dont say that they just say lol youre not even really black
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hating white people wont make black people like you more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this may be the best sentence ive read in a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im on acid this bitch is basic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,salt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best comment of the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im assuming psl is pumpkin spice latte is it now so ubiquitous that it gets its own initialism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yesterday i saw this cute little dog being walked by two girls on the sidewalk i said i like your dog as i passed them they told me to fuck off i wasnt even upset i was just shocked i just liked their dog
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be honest i dont think its race some girls are really stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah that had nothing to do with her being white edit i forgot its cool to be racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found a follower
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my white friends told us about how she doesnt eat anything with spices has nothing home cooked only shit put in an oven from asda and she only uses salt not even pepper she didnt even know you could make rice in a pot since she thought you just microwave it like uncle bens shes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah yall need to talk to your white women delegation cause i swear white girls are the ones bragging they cant even boil water
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont get your hopes up too high not all latinas can cook my mom is puerto ricanspanish and cant cook to save her life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you keep doing you man im black and can only cook at a poorcollegestudentlevel follow your dreams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean like louis ck says we can go back in time to pretty much any point in history and be pretty ok so weve got that going for us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wellyes are you saying yes all whites
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oohso closei give it a
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nahim an assholejust not a racist asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless its male then it wears sperrys and a ralph lauren polo with salmon shorts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,leave then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not surprised unfortunately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id go with less legitimate lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never understood the concept of white guilt like to me its basically saying that its wrong to have empathy and youre going against your whiteness
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm im sjw af and i think making fun of white people is hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just saw this sorry you got downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mglln always starting shit tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you do that too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta use ceddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i almost asked how you tag used to know but then flashbacks of res threads in saved me from that mistake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yall got butter up in this bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn you now i want to know what they said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lifes good when you dont lump yourself in with people you share a skin tone with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or telling black people i cant believe how yall are times as likely to be criminals 😂😂😂 straight up fire fam edit well someone got triggered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for example abusing oppressing and excluding black people for centuries leaving them broadly speaking in positions of lower socioeconomic status and then acting shocked and indignant when black people have higher crime rates
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha generalizing people is fun haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right im not paying radical muslims salaries
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,foreal that is the worst comparison ive ever seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,woah your comment sent me on an emotional rollercoaster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah itd be awesome if millions of fathers werent locked up due to a system bent against them that would be cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that last sentence doesnt belong at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because proportionately whites arent killed as frequently as black people black americans are five times more likely to be shot by a police officer than white americans secondly you have a higher chance of being killed by a bear or your own fridge than a muslim terrorist attack httpwwwlifeinsurancequotesorgadditionalresourcesdeadlystatistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what they say when you show them your savings accountcredit score
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but why would a white person care an unintelligent person would care simply because they understand it to be an insult but not because they are white if i call a stupid person fortuitous they might assume i am insulting them and be offended simply because they believe they have been insulted the meaning of the word the color of their skin all irrelevant the other problem is that people believe they are supposed to be offended by being called white they believe that if they dont take it as an insult they are being racist you cant be proud of being white thats bad in todays world if you arent wildly offended by being called white you are literally on par with the kkk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why not nothing wrong with being white is there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is ironic since youre so white used to be tossed around a fair bit in this sub before the mods cracked down it was usually related to slang misusage or misunderstanding
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its kind of neutral kind of just an objective statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you kidding white people love drama
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do we im ok with these statements but please say some or most were not all the same
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is funny because italy hasnt even been good in the world cup since
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im guessing you hang out with people who grew up in the new world some people from the us think this is a americaonly thing but hang out anywhere in south america and youll find people with just as mixed backgrounds my wife is argentinian but her mom is russian and her dad is german go figure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats wrong with that haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in america if one of your grandparents is full blooded native american you get a lot of the benefits afforded to natives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😣😣😫😫 how could you do this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or its because adjectives come before the nouns they describe following your logic white person is just as discriminatory
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but it does nothing grammatically that whole reason is fabricated and has no significance except what the people who use it try to give it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a trivial thing for people to nitpick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually no most black ppl have been called so black for listening to rap or talking a certain way for years we just get mildly annoyed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but we shouldnt purposefully cause racism and then use the excuse that it starts a dialogue while not actually discussing it meaningfully at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ooooooooohh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this for real i get a little embarrassed when a girl says im not that black but if she says im real black you best believe that im erect af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a perfect oxymoron
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obvi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly considering how basics lose their shit over it every fall is that really a surprise to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,workers at starbucks writes psl on the cup when someone orders so the barista know when to make it probably thats whh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh okay theyre psl now we need a shorthand for pumpkin spice lates thats how fundamental they are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,initialism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao that is so fucking rude and mean but just picturing that is still funny sorry that happened i hope later you were able to be like what the fuck and laugh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i know but white girls was context
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok my bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like both of these people are dickheads
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes lol thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes still quite young
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of the first few posts on my instagram is of my cousins baby momma food she made us i tried to put a filter on it to add life to the plate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me i cant because i been trying to get the cookout or yellow rangers to select me in every race draft thread i have no leverage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man i love louie but its shit like thati get its a joke but old school white cultures had so much class discrimination and its not like other cultures didnt have prominent empires to go back in time to lol were discussing time travel i should stop procrastinating and do my shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry son im going to have to charge you with pww
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that flair tho lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically i dont even know the mindset that allows me to wantonly generalize millions of people with a hand wave except for mexicans they are the adobo seasoning of the earth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least youre honest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and the shorts are in seersucker fabric
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure white guilt is just when white peoples feel guilty about the ways their ancestors treated black people which is kinda silly to have guilt for something dead people did to other dead people but whatever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its those people that go to the extreme and pretty much hate being white because of something their ancestors did one thing to have empathy and another to hate your self and others of your race just because of some shit that happened in the past
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just wanted an answer because i seriously have no idea what its all about but oh well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomrqciucyjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought i was the only one i do it so i can track subreddit viewing habits so that i can create character profiles of them helps put a face on the type of people who make those types of comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,type in unreddit on the url if youre on the desktop i know it works with deleted comments dunno about removes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at the same time that whites are taught to see their interests and perspectives as universal they are also taught to value the individual and to see themselves as individuals rather than as part of a racially socialized group individualism erases history and hides the ways in which wealth has been distributed and accumulated over generations to benefit whites today it allows whites to view themselves as unique and original outside of socialization and unaffected by the relentless racial messages in the culture individualism also allows whites to distance themselves from the actions of their racial group and demand to be granted the benefit of the doubt as individuals in all cases a white person recognizes whiteness as real but as the individual problem of other bad white people given the ideology of individualism whites often respond defensively when linked to other whites as a group or accused of collectively benefiting from racism because as individuals each white person is different from any other white person and expects to be seen as such diangelo r white fragility international journal of critical pedagogy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ironic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you serious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stopping one causes a group of people to not be allowed to enter a country the latter would cause huge problems with crime and the inability to police anything and theres very little statistical data to show blacks get killed more than whites and if anything its the opposite your analogy is really poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a reason they call it fatherless america work needs to be done on both ends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like i said work needs to be done on both ends young black males commit serious crimes over minuscule things jordan killings and go to trial in a system with no intention of helping them they leave families behind only for their children to do the same and black culture often promotes this it is a terrible cycle but one that can be fixed we cant change the world unless we change ourselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so youre telling me that of they commit crimes they shouldnt go to jail this is like the logic where people like michael brown try to go kill the officers and once they officer kills them people just start crying aobut how he had his hands up and all this bullshit the officer would have been fucked by these lies had the honest people not put in anonymous tips that brown was actually trying to kill the officer and didnt have his arms up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hillarys going to fix all of that though s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if argue it is the most important part of the discussion nearly all of these issues stem from fatherless families
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this makes too much sense for it to be on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unironically using the word fortuitous lol u so white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait what sarcasm orpeople really believe they are supposed to be offended from being called white never heard of or encountered that myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there isnt but laughing at someone for being so white seems to imply that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white people get uncomfortable when you say white people without addressing them as special and unique individuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when someone refers to a people they are reffering to a systemculture not individuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the two world cups that have been held this is dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these people dont watch football unless its the world cup anyway so its not like they know what theyre talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i actually live in the us but i grew up in scotland
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i dont think thats how the phrase came to be there needed to be a phrase to describe nonwhites since minority will soon not be true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not an oxymoron
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats so fetch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,totes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe psl has two billboard awards to your zero
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpwwwdictionarycombrowseinitialism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its a pretty amusing situation like is their dog so cute that they got tired of hearing about it ill never know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh but it gets better she burnt fucking beans on toast with cheese i dont know how but she burnt it shes worse than squidwards burning that guys shake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like its reasonable to expect a year old to know that rice comes in other forms than uncle bens microwave shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds seriousi better call my lawyer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id like to say i earned it somehowbut i requested it back when the request thread was stickied
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but nobody feels that way white guilt is tacked onto anyone who acknowledges racial issues and white peoples role in it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the idea is that some whites feel bad because said dead people doing to other dead people was a direct cause of living people being better off than other living people though ill admit its weird to see someone whine that they got the long end of the stick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white guilt is when white people feel guilty about being content with living within a system that privledges them through the oppression of others white guilt isnt good btw it centers white people like if they feel bad then do something about it march donate educate yourself and others dont just tell everyone how guilty you feel its annoying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you actually know people like this because i have a very hard time believing they exist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cool y
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i expected you to be upvoted and answered instead you offended the people who complain about sjws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre that type of chick who knows that the guy her best friend is dating is a cheating asshole but you keep it secret let her find out the hard way then comfort her about it and be like mhmm i knew he was no good honey you deserve better
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and while were bickering we dont realize it was you who runs away with the karma
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryiziefqx
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least youre honest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryiziefqx
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for me i read certain threads usually about racism or sexism and hover over the usernames of particularly rude people if theyve been on the sub for more than year and have a low comment score i look at their history if its a troll or someone whos constantly on the subs arguing i block them i know some people would say im not giving them a chance to engage or to tell their side but reddit is pretty much all about everyone giving their side
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a bunch of woo woo shit dude identifying as an individual is not a racialized thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hooooo my nigga talking bout that first nations mistreatment and the inherent biases of the justice system stay woke good point about being able to measure actual crime commission police have a lot of discretion in deciding who to arrest and studies on matters like rates of cops pulling people over suggest that cops will target minorities at much higher rates even when factors like the speed of the people pulled over are accounted for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this here is a real life goon props im saving your shit btw cause i know i will need to copy pasta this in the next two days or so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre absolutely right whether or not the point is right it certainly makes them easier to make
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought we were talking about how white people oppress black people not the gop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes we are not living in the anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of course more white people are killed than black in gross black people make up of the population in america proportionally they are killed at a much higher rate by police
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcompxrimdagif
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a reason they call it fatherless america yea so how bout you do actual research into the issue
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah lets vote for the dude who wants to increase police power and bring stop and frisk back clearly trump has black interests at heart foh if you think black people not voting for trump is against their interests you dont understand black interests
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as opposed to trump who wants to do stop and search nationwide the program he loves that was declared racist and abolished in new york fuck off retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,amen when i read his first comment i was actually nodding and agreeing about black culture having a problem sure everyones an asshole and if everyone collectively fix their shit we all be good then he went on and on and still on about black people not having a father as the main issue of the problem thats when i started thinkingi think very seldom sure missing fathers is an issue but also is gang affiliations young black males fixation to be as manly and as hard as possible poverty bad education stuck in the hood us vs everyone mentality racial preference when it comes to jobs so youngins either go for that sports or music career at least we know people prefer us when its about that shit and of course institutionalized or just straight up racism there are so many reasons why black people in america are disgruntled and its not just because my dad left me when i was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so youre telling me that of they commit crimes they shouldnt go to jail boy unbelievable your mind went straight to this kind of conclusion from what he said instead of realizing that the lawpolice system is biased against blacks resulting in them being sent to prison more often then their counterparts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stems from poverty you jackass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ooo i have a copy pasta just for you also i want everyone to know that no criminologist will ever say black people commit more crimes because we have no way to measure that atm all we can say is black people have a higher rate of being arrested charged convicted and incarcerated not the same thing and anyone that uses those stats to try and argue that black people commit more crimes is either straight up racist or a severe example of the dunning kreuger effect these stats dont reflect black people they reflect our justice system heres another one myth blacks commit half the crimes despite only making up of the population fact out of every violent crimes only are reported httpswwwrainnorgstatisticscriminaljusticesystem out of those violent crimes result in arrests out of those crimes result in the charges being dropped due to lack of evidence or some type of police or prosecutor malpractice httpchicagoreportercomchargesdismissed out of those charged who go to court plead guilty plead not guilty httpwwwuscourtsgovaboutfederalcourtstypescasescriminalcases out of those who plead guilty are found not guilty out of those people in prison of them are later found to be falsely convicted out of those people of them are black httpwwwinfowarscomblackcrimefactsthatthewhiteliberalmediadarenttalkabout that doesnt mean black people commit half the crimes it means black people commit of the crimes and the additional of the crimes we dont know who commits because the criminal justice system is a failure but yes the liberal media completely lies and spreads propaganda as you provide no proof what so ever s its also very telling that you basically say that anyone is smart is a liar who is just there to brainwash us while at the same time you probably only listen to people such as breitbart or foxnews
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you browse the donald so obviously you dont understand you cuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,notallwhitepeople
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nor do they really care if italy wins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well of course you arent but its a goddamn adjective you know what you do in english put adjectives before the noun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah tells me that theyre white or think they are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont you think that wording was insensitive i feel that by saying tells me a lot about you indicates that you feel you come before me since you used me before you i feel that all people should be equals and that kind of language is hurtful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im perfectly aware but there isnt a better term to my knowledge other than simple irony i guess you could say bubble integrity is its own oxymoron
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its still not going to happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better call saul
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing here although i did send them a link to the ultimate bollywood bad movie as thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im proud of my flair mostly cause a mod gave it to me randomly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had a flair from that thread but they took it away from me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,neither of those points are true there is no aspect of white privilege that requires anyone to be oppressed secondly the people that feel white guilt are the ones out there doing the marches with other sjws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,given how fucked up comments can be on this sub i just wanna say im loving these real motherfuckin intersectional hours rn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it isnt white people are oppressing black people its the institutions that be hold systemic remnants of jim crow that have not been purged yet from redlining to enforcementbycommunity there is a legacy of jim crow that still hasnt been cleansed even after the passage of the civil rights act
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you gotta step out that bubble you live in man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so what you think racism doesnt exist anymore that would be a nice fantasy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you think this happens and what is the underlying reason that makes young black males do this time and time again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly pretty much all those issues including things like taking away fathers is all the cause of systemic government protocols which generally target the lowerclass and indirectly incidentally affect black people and other minorities disproportionately i hope that doesnt make me sound like some sort of conspiracist i watched and did a bunch of readings on systemic racism this week for class and laws that lowkey propagate racism are evidently more common than most people would think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you certainly make a good point but what is the role of a father in life i think having a dad would drastically cut down on the people joining gangs associating violence with being a man and the disregard for formal education
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not even bothering to argue with the replies i got people are working super hard to miss the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is the chicken and which is the egg i suppose difficult to tell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you support a candidate who called one of his supporters a thug for being black sorry but making jokes about white people isnt racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the house noun was blue adjective but like say colored people so you can be a grammar winner and keep being willfully ignorant that there is any context to the word order in this situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tells me a lot about you i know you have no idea why that isnt trivial not op but how is that saying anyone comes before anyone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not entirely but youre close enough in the ballpark ill allow it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how bad is the ultimate bad bollywood movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what did you do to get deflaired
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,white privledge includes access to better education than non whites whites have this privledge because non whites have been denied better education historically and currently the reason something is considered white privledge is because it is not afforded to non white peoples just because you march doesnt mean you are not problematic ive been to so many marches where white people center themselves and start trouble white guilt is a sympton of self centered white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,threads like this are refreshing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know i just like when they realized they lost and delete their comments or start saying some real outlandish shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just had to use your comment i swear i can predict this shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so fight racism with racism alrighty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean it definitely still exists but yall act like every day you risk getting shot just for being black i get that police brutality is a thing but yall exaggerate the shit out of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me english isnt my first language whats the plural of the word anecdote
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no i totally agree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope all that stems from poverty gangs only look good because the education system is fucked and there are limited options violence and poverty have gone hand in hand since forever which is why methheads are also violent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i actually replied to the wrong person but to be fair i agree with most of the things youve said except that imo the main root of the problem was the day we got our rights was also the same day we were left with nothing my grandfather was forced to live in the hood where its just a bunch of confused black people not know what to do next education in the hood is not the same education that white people get theres a saying that was youre in the hood youre in it for good well of course white people always say why not just move lol well my grandpa didnt have a good paying job to just move out of the hood and live with the white people in them good suburban communities so what he did was work his ass off stick with the hood and made sure that my dad gets the life that hes always wanted for him and luckily it worked out my dad moved to dc went to community college at the age of was already at that time got an actual career at the age of just in time for me to go to college and look at what date it is its already white people had this trouble maybe back in the and they bounced back we are just starting to bounce back but its really hard because of all these chains and disadvantages that are set by institutionalized racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no it isnt since the negative aspects of black culture came after the hellacious poverty and through outside influence black people didnt ship cocaine out of south america or put themselves in ghettoes or not give themselves jobs or destroy the school systems that served them or even keep funding what passes for gangsta rap now dont try that we dont have a clue shit they didnt refuse to give people with black names callbacks or sentence them more harshly for identical crimes or destroy all black attempts to build a solid income base man the list goes on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that the stats are wrong but they cant measure all crime if white people commit more crime but are arrested less and various studies ranging from police practices in pulling over people to stop and frisk procedures prove that police target minorities disproportionately then all the stats can really say accurately is which races of people police arrest more its called the invisible statistic of crime educate yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me what sounds more unwieldy the green person the person that is green theres nothing racist about that language language is just used based on how easy it is literally thousands of words are pronounced the way they are because some poor peasant people couldnt be bothered to enunciate it correctly and then theres this little detail that you can find on dictionarycom adjective definition a part of speech that describes a noun or pronoun adjectives are usually placed just before the words they qualify shy child blue notebook rotten apple four horses another table
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,objection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,features some old guy who use to act in disco movies as the hero an auto rickshaw army and more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nothing it just disappeared it was qs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah man noam chomsky and howard zinn really fucked me up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stay fucken woke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeeeeah trust me racism exists in more forms than just black people being shot and are we supposed to take comfort in the fact that what maybe well only have an unjustified police shooting every other week rather than every day should we not be concerned over police brutality if a certain quota of black men arent murdered unjustly every month fuck you dude why are you even here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how many people die per year over mayonnaise and what do the demographics look like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is the education system fucked and why are other jobs not an option
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre lucky your grandfather and fathers were such hard workers good luck in your future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as long as theyre not malicious no thats not really racist either thanks for putting words in my mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im gonna watch this tomorrow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have to say i´m intrigued now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just asking a grammar question youre getting me to think its data
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wouldnt even call it any kind of evidence youre trying to equate poor people stealing expensive shoes to lack of father figures in their lives seriously doubt you know what youre talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because of institutionalized racism i dont hate you as much as the other people on this thread but right now you sound ignorant well of course you wouldnt know it until youve experienced it getting better education andor job is really hard to achieve when youre below that poverty line and once youre down below the system would make sure that you stay there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just use google you ignorant asshat either youre racist or blind but i dont need to educate you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah that was awesome harris got owned zinn was a historian i think he specialized in popular uprisings he has a book called a peoples history of the united states really top notch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way he ethered sam harris ahaha i enjoyed that so so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol nice defense there man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe because black people have been oppressed for the majority of this countries history
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you wanna fuck with a patriot give them a book by howard zinn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least he proves a president has a stupid amount of power for a single man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least we know he wont get a second term
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my paycheck does not come in for two more days and it feels like it has been months since we got paid last trump definitely messing with the time continuum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its gonna be a long years for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is the source for this pic it would make a fine addition to my collection of reaction picsgifs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it may have only been a week but the amount of work toward racial equality and civil rights he has undone will have ramifications for more than a few years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im almost impressed really in one week the man has made moves on a huge chunk of what he promised if what he promised wasnt so horrifying id be applauding the man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know its felt like week for me i still dont get the hate towards him but i dont care about politics either so there is that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a stupid amount of power for a stupid man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone told me dont worry itll take awhile before he can even pass half the racist shit hes claiming hell do but here we are already a ban on muslim countries next is the concentration camps
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,power had been creeping over to the executive branch for far too long and nobody seemed to care they care now though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we need to make more rules so that only liberal presidents have that level of power
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you would think that but your past self would have also thought he wouldnt have gotten a first term either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never overestimate america
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bush got two bro dont underestimate him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or so we hope
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,said the people in never unestimate the power of stupidity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wouldnt bother with such a simple typo but just in case anyone else sees this and hyperventilates its just weeks you can make it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you live in the us you should im canadian and this is literally all i talk about now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i still dont get the hate for him lol youre either playing dumb or youre fundamentally wired to have zero empathy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont care about politics politics sure as fuck cares about you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sayin i thought he wouldnt get away with half the shit he claimed and its already like the ceilings covered with shit and the fan is on high
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a day halt on immigration using the list that obama compiled during his presidency
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or few people seemed to know as they counted on and the ones who did notice were not taken seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or ya know the people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i i cant argue with that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not even distant past either im talkin months ago i was like no way this mf gonna win then i was like no way this mf gonna actually pull all that bullshit now im like why am i still surprised
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most people didnt even think he would win the primaries many doubted that he would even last more than a couple of months before he would drop out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im americandont really care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not playing dumb i just truly dont care bruh let him be prez stop judging him based on first impressions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sure they do thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah he just calls it cia camps and pleads for making torture legal again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that middle school social studies lesson about branches of government with checks and balances was so full of shit primarally because of the shift in power amongst the three has changed but moreover the rise of the branch has been unseen and also completely unchecked this branch is all the groups that basically make up most of the bulk of the government epa faa dhs fbi irs nsa dod fda doe ntsb dea etc these groups have influence directly on the branches are lead and run by nonelected persons unlike the branches make their own power and pass policies that effect your daily life that dont have to follow the process that laws do think about it how many times a day in your daily life are you effected by something the senate or the supreme court does rarely but the car you drive the gas you use the phone you make calls on the plane you ride in what you drink what you eat etc are all controlled and regulated by a branch party run by people you didnt elect and with power they make on their own
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,apathy game on fleek
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arent those departments with leaders that are appointed by the president executive or am i wrong if so when you vote for the president you vote in turn for support of ideals that are advertized on a presidential campaign trail for example trump just appointed a guy to head the fcc that is against net neutrality and will likely do everything he can to kill it now i dont like this but i acknowledge that trump ran as a republican and has expressed past opposition to net neutrality therefore i have to assume that if he gets elected hes going to do everything he can to do what i dont like with regards to things like net neutrality or foreign policy or immigration or whatever when you vote for the president you are indirectly voting for department administrators who embody the same values as the candidate you are voting for at least thats how i understand it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good point thats a scary realization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the ramen noodle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shrug true i have a life to live dont care too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes until he made it illegal even then i oppose gitmo still doesnt make trumps protorture talk any less frightening
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that honestly good for you man if none of this bullshit is getting to you like im canadian and i used to just laugh at the memes but when his administration used the attack on muslim canadians in quebec to argue that the muslim ban was good dawg that was the line for me man i am beefing with trump fags on reddit as we speak and man its not nice my people say playing an instrument for a cow thats what it feels like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all good man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess its just that to me sure the guy may be corrupt and sure he might of done some bad shit but the world is full of corrupt shit so why should his actions surprise us live your life experience what you want to we need to stop living for others and just for yourself and your loved ones thats all i got to say to be honest it just annoys me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok so torture is illegal on us soil and trump wants to make it legal proves my point tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt he also want to reopen cia camps im belgian this is what i saw on american media thats why i ask
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he wants to open gitmo i didnt know it closed

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip naruto shippuden
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how good of a reference does it have to be can i just say something bleachrelated aizen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im a simple man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my school has a japanese culture club and im pretty sure my sister is the only japanese person there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,intrestingly enough when you went further up in japanese classes the alot of the hardcore weebs went away my ap japanese class senior year was relatively normal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mine straight up had an anime club that was apparently really popular every single lunch hour for as long as i was in hs they would meet up at lunch hour and watch anime it had teacher support av rights and they let them paint a bigass anime mural in the hallway outside the classroom they used
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you think those weebs are bad wait till you meet the business weebs obsessed with kaizen kanban boards and the toyota productions system
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the smell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you imagine the smell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,japanese class at my high school was the weebs and the football players we had good laughs but at the expense of different japanese teachers i still feel bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,many years ago i took japanese for four years in high school and ended up nearly fluent i did it because it was more challenging than the other languages offered i didnt like anime i still dont like anime with some exceptions and mostly what i used it for was to talk to old japanese people and listen to their stories and read historical texts for papers on historical japanese culture because the only thing i can be considered really crazy about in japanese culture is the history of japan from the shogunates up through world war one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reiatsu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that lasted literally two pages yesimstillbitter

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats zangetsu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bleach manga spoilers below for anyone who actually cares ichigos bankai gets broken by one of the final arcs villains ichigo gets taken to zero squad to have his sword repaired the whole arc they tease his new bankai make you wonder what its gonna be like then that shit is in like two pages hurt my heart man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,soul society arc was lit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was so angry with the way that it ended grew up on that shit and it just became garbage rip bleach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fucking filler man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no the lil one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im so sad that isnt a thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i aint no scrub it was unrelated to his commenthowever the fact still stands that somewhere out theresome nigga has an executioners blade just patiently waiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,down with the swirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,since when you were under the impression youre on rblackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if her situation is anything like my friends when we were in high school then shes constantly turning weebs down and correcting stereotypes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,son i had to watch over one of those clubs in high school that place is so fucking weird it hurts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf who wants to go to a club about your own cullture in hs most of those kids got at least some chats about that stuff with their parents and are already sick about it just from that let alone eatng into their free time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn i wish they had this at my hs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are they generally annoyed by weebos or flattered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id say thats probably because all the weebs took the beginner japanese courses because they figured they could easily pick up japanese for the purposes of watching anime and claiming superiority over other weebs but when they actually started learning it they realized that japanese isnt just something you can casually absorb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was the teachers assistant for an ap japanese class in highschool and it was the best to see the weebs in the class who where only there because of their love for anime the amount of times ive heard oh i heard that in this anime or this wasnt in any anime ive watched hurts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there was a podcast i listened to where the hosts were japanese majors and they complained that they find their way up even in the highest levels

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anime is only real when you dont believe it bruh what😂😂😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deserves more upvotes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abridged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this will make a fine addition to my collection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what is the effect that activates tho all i know is that it activates
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im actually so pissed at the way bleach ended his new sword was teased for hundreds of chapters youre expecting some badass sword that combines hollow shinigami and quincy abilities nope you just get a regular ass sword and aizen winds up fucking up yhwach and ichigo finishes him with regular shikai shit had me so heated ive devoted years to this show and they end it like that fuck that noise the least that shonen can do for us is make the last arc into a couple movies because there were some crazy fights that happened namely kenpachi splitting a meteor in half
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dropped it after they reveal hes part quincy that is too much nonsense for my blood and no good could follow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unpopular opinion i enjoyed the arrancar and hueco mundo arcs and i enjoyed the mini arc with that dude named shinji and the mask people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its even more tragic if you learned why it actually fell off i enjoyed what we saw of the final arc even if its true potential was never realized
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least some of the filler was actually interesting like the bount arc bringing them back to soul society so they can actually have the ending from the manga arc line up with the tv arc into the vizard arc and the zampakuto rebellion arc was also good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think he actually gets his name from tracy mcgrady
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man i was getting tilted for a sec i was like wtf man zabuza isnt in motha fucking bleach fucking everyone knows hes from one piece quit clownin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,zabusas sword got nothing on the dragonslayer tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id hate to be that guy who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time just walking down the street minding my own business when suddenly some dude with zabuzas executioner blade cleaves my head in a second
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsyoutubehlekjnwyaxg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all according to my plan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im might be too big of an optimist now but hey maybe at least some of those weebs are going to get a reality check and start to get their shit together
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or constantly riding dick and getting shit bought for her you dont know her maybe she likes to fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i consider myself a weeb but it could not prepare me for the experience that was my first visit to the anime club
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no you dont trust me fulla wannabes and weebs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if something is difficult it probably isnt worth doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had a similar experience i was a fourth year student and there were only of us who made it through so we ended up crammed in the corner of a japanese class when the teacher got cancer and was absent a lot the instructions for the substitute were let delvaris teach this lesson plan and it was written entirely in japanese so the sub couldnt fuck it up eventually they found a sub that could speak japanese and the fun was over it was fun playing teacher to a bunch of freshman weebs though especially the ones that thought they were hot shit and they were a little further along id put them on their place by refusing to speak anything but japanese to them the confusion on their face was glorious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cartoons are a good way to learn a language they often use simple grammar and vocabulary

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,newest episode came out days ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,general kenobi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rbptcg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it doesnt look like either of those maybe its just a sword
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just in case you dont know theres a dude trying to animate it himself havent kept up on it but i think episodes are supposed to be releasing this year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its because sj forced kubo to end bleach early yhwach getting killed by a fucking arrow point is so lazy it hurt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel exactly the same and it hurts me every fucking day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as far as im concerned it ended after final zangetsu he lost his powers and rukia bid him goodbye
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was subbed to rbleach and since the beginning of that arc the term asspull was banned from the sub
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man when ichigo let his hollow form out against ulquiorra that was some amazing shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those arcs were good however fullbringer and beyond were ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude hueco mundo arrancar was fucking nuts and thats putting it lightly the way that they split up at the beginning just to somehow come together near the end was freakin awesome solid for sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,arrancarheuco mundo arc was on another fucking level man aizen was a fucking amazing villain the world of heuco mundo was so fleshed out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,curious to know as to why as i just finished the anime recently i agree that everything post aizen was pretty rough especially relatively speaing i googled it and it seemed like the consensus was that there was so much filler that everything after the main arc was pretty much deemed irrelevant because it got pretty bad ill admit there was a lot of talking in the fullbringer era not to mention how that whole mod soul thing got mentioned once in the immediate episode after that but it was like it never happened since ichigo didnt really regain his power but god damn the espatta era was fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why did it fall off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why mention that and not elaborate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh naruto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a meaningless slab of iron you cant even lift
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think so man people grow and change i have friends who outgrew it or are casual fans i also know people who just fell deeper down the rabbit hole of weebdom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,atleast your school doesnt have full on furries running around with tails
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,japanese is just a ridiculous language to learn the alphabet syntax double meanings very difficult to learn when english is your first language
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh man every time there was a sub i basically ruled the class man absolute power corrupts absolutely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,agreed but some kids took it far xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more like rbusinesssystems
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the next one wont come out till october
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hello there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of course thats a thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,could be but the shape and color suggests is just a shitty zangetsu
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh thats nice i wasnt expecting the quality for a fan project to be that good its obviously not studio quality but if he can get the voices right thatll more than make up some shakey animations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reading that in the manga then waiting almost years to see it finally animated was the greatest thing to ever happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me and another user post a video and give a brief synopsis in this thread if your curious and yes the hueco mundo arc was dope i keep the soundtrack in my workout playlist as a matter of fact my workout playlist has a good chunk of bleach songs my fave track from the series
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres no fully confirmed story that i know of but the second one seems to make more sense the original rumour was due to bleaches decking popularity after the aizen arc and he poor reception of the fullbring arc jump started to rush kubo into finishing and kept pushing up that deadline to the point where the ending feels like and pretty much was a rushed deus ex machina which was clearly rushed and poorly written the second rumour is that kubo got sick from working so hard on the manga fairly early on which is why the art started to decline imo in the beginning it was the best looking of the big three in terms of art and aesthetic then lost a lot of its charm around the hueco mundo arc it feels like a mix of both to me but no one knows but kubo unless some more info came out heres a good video it was the animemanga that got me into manga in general and even with its questionable quality is in my top ten
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this video explains it in fine detail why bleach fell off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like the distinction you made i have friends and i also know people between this two groups but yeah i get what you mean i met people frome both sides i guess my case is kinda rarer because i somehow skipped my cringy weeb phase as an early teen i absolutely fucking despised everything about anime sometimes later i got my hands on first episode of samurai champloo got hooked and started exploring wondering if i actually was wrong everything snowballed to the point where now i watch series every season while still maintaining perfectly normal life in every aspect some kind of weird fucking weeb limbo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how many shuriken are in their fanny pack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus fucking christ mate what the hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk fam team fs been churning them out pretty regularly recently now hellsing ultimate or yugioh abridged thats a waiting time lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because its black with a white edge some real stretching right there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what would you recommend as a good stopping point for someone that has never seen an episode of bleach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imo the art was still pretty badass and poetic kubo did say the last chapter was how he wanted the series to end everything in between the start of the soul palace invasion and the final chapter was rushed as all hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ye i heard both of these rumours not sure which is the real one but tbh both are bad there was so much wasted potential with the zero squad aizens comeback the soul king why all the wandenreich had such weird ass powers worst is i was really looking forward to the thousand year blood arc after that fullbringer shit it was definitely my go to every week because i loved it so much stuck through all the way to the end and well what happened happened
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man watch what you like read what you like im a casual fan in that way every so often theres something new that comes out and im like hey this is pretty dope but until you start obsessively collecting figurines wearing too much merchandise or claiming everything from japan to be superior dont call yourself a weeb haha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a big difference between a weeb and someone who just watches anime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always loved anime back in the day when the only way to watch anime was to buy vhs tapes from the record stores and shit i missed the weeb thing because it wasnt a huge thing but i did get the chance to live in japan for years at so that officially satisfied every curiosity i had
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more than enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats one of our seniors about to goto college btw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hellsing ultimate was yearly one episode every halloween but theyre doing it twice a year now so the series should be finished within the next year since they only have around more episodes left
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,general size and shape combined with that yeah there are some really really shitty attempts to recreate anime swords this wouldnt be the worst ive seen but if you think its not then im not going to change your mind and this whole exchange is pretty pointless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would just sit and enjoy the ride to be honest or skip the fillers though the last filler is decent if you really want a stopping point i would skip fillers and stop at the end of the final battle against aizen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was surprised by the jump in art quality around the ichigo vs ulquiora i know i know fight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well calling myself a weeb is sort of defence mechanism make it your shield when they try to insult you kinda thing all this merchandisefigurine shit is ridiculous anyway everytime i see them im wondering who the fuck pays for that because those prices are goddamn absurd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see you say that but ive seen too many people get called weebs for even remotely liking anything japanese that word is like cuck in the sense that they lost their meaning and are used incorrectly a lot of the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i watch anime and want to live in japan but those things are mutually exclusive anime because fuck you why not japan because i just want to get super lit and roam the countryside for a month that country is beautiful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it doesnt change in college trust me i have seen some shit man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as is your penis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to add on this have an idiot friend who calls me and my other friend weebs if we mention the game overwatch at all its not even fucking japanese
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wouldnt that make it worse especially since theyre out on their own
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not even a bit i went for film some people at art based schools take their fanfare to the extreme it got to the point a grown man could walk in dressed as noel from blazblue and the most youd get from me is ok cool story ironically the scariest person at the campus was waay too deep into sonic the hedgehog take that as you will
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obama went to the virgin islands cuz everywhere else is fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then you see her snapchat story and theres the same dude with her in every pic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if he cant comeback because of the new green card policies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tfw you dont know that feel because that cold bitch blocked you on social media hahahahaha 😥😥😥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,americas self destructive binge is gonna leave her ass without any friends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we gonna be drunk texting obama in years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah id unfollow them right then n there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abusing powers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey bighead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he definitely deserves this tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least we know one brother who safe from all this bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did this my ex broke up with me shes in after calling me immature so i spent the next few days bar hopping and having fun and loving the fact that she still looked at my snapchat stories
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hopefully theyll let him back in the country without demanding his birth certificate and asking if hes a christian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obama never abused executive authority
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least obama is where hes most comfortable on vacation surrounded by rich white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,british too not even us virgin islands
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can someone put this guy out because hes on fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the same dude she told you not to worry about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly all youre gonna get from browsing your exs snapchat after a breakup is pain dont do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the same dude that youve seen creeping awhile back but thought nothing of it so you didnt push it and a month later shes blowing him in the back of his car before you show up to pick her from work sorry its been a tough month
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my heart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,loving the virgin islands might move 🤔🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plot twist its her cousin whos in town for the weekend and trying to help cheer her up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck it guess hell have to kick it on vacation with every amenity available to him until they change it again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obama bruh i was the president airport security whatever you say daquan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she blocked me on fb trying to act up i deleted her off snap insta blocked her on iphone psn twitter too like i aint playn bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we already do every day on bpt with our memes n shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think he will abuse it power dont have a pussy to grab
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes had the least vacation days out of the past presidents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ignorant white kid who probably doesnt know that obama had less vacation days than gwb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still managed to stay below gwb in vacation days but thats not my business
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you cant just say this shit on bpt and expect to not get downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stop i cant handle the sadness
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is getting to real for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,always that bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when my girl and i broke up a while ago i instantly unfollowed on all social media highly recommend it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best way to get over someone is to get under someone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i could just see him being on some random little island nation and they offer him a leadership position
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you sayin obama is superman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god damn you cut that bitch off on psn damn son not even i did that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair presidents have been abusing powers back to at least w himself more and more executive orders every term
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,implying that downvotes mean something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,🎶 but you say hes just a friend 🎶
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seconded why tf everybody think its smart to stay social media friends or friends period with they exes idgaf if you best gaddam friends that shit dont go well people need to just let go and move on friends come and go just like relationships you got that main squad right if not find you some lifers n fuck everybody else nbsp damn i aint mean to start ranting n shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmfao what a twist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think im missing the last half of that equation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and he fixes all the problems within a month and realizes darn it i improved everything again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can neither confirm nor deny that statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,obama actually had less than bush not by much but more and more executive orders every term this isnt technically true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i aint do shit the cop planted that on me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good job responding without actually addressing their point your meager attempts at condescension dont mask the fact that youre clearly wrong stay ignorant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre missing the point its obvious you came into this sub looking for a fight because you knew someone would get mad stop it its pathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okay maybe that wasnt the best reaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no that was hyperbole obama had fewer executive orders but he did have executive actions and memoranda obama had to work around the republican government a fair deal but the expanded executive powers now in the hands of an unstable man are dangerous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a non sequitur how does the number of gwbs vacations refute the original point youre the ones deflecting that obama is more comfortable on vacation surrounded by rich old white people than in his hometown of chicago trying to i dont know try to leverage the power of his position to combat the record setting murder epidemic seems like if he was half as concerned about you as he claims hed actually try to do something to help you rather than spend all his time in hawaii and the virgin islands of course no matter what he does you all will lick his ass regardless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,heres a fun game usually in most bpt threads youll see a lot of httpimgurcomzisvzhk at the bottom especially after the election if you go through these users submitted posts almost all of the time youll see that theyve got mouthfuls of trump dick for example its so strange to me why so many of chucklefucks fans are so obsessed with bitching about this this sub after the election what the fuck did they expect from black people on twitter during the election the dude had a approval rating from black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its almost like he deserves a small break after doing one of the most stressful jobs in the world for the past years i think hes dealt with enough bullshit to warrant at least a couple of weeks off and im not gonna be petty enough to complain that hes not saving america from a crisis they brought on themselves lets not pretend that you actually care about obamas activism choices when you really just came here to bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he literally just got back from a hawaiian vacation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt this one of the top posts on this sub

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,e e cummings on her face yeah thats poetry in motion 🙏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for me personally i thought the lyrics said legacyblack family phantom and didnt think about what he said when hes repeating panda so when i go look up the lyrics and see what it actually says all i did was shake my head because i was so out of touch because a white car black car panda is literally a hit radio song right now here i am thinking hes rapping about things that matter like legacy and family too much game of thrones maybe and its not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you feel like an asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and i get bleach on my tshirt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was some type of reddit joke that i wasnt familiar with

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that the black car the white carpanda the white car itself looks like a panda it doesnt even sound like you understand the simplest part of the lyrics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a gospel album
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have just now noticed that the first guy did it the white boi way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,check it out guys a kiss alarm clock i wanna rock n roll all night and wake up every day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this comment and your username say a lot on what kind of person you are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you not see your hypocrisy people are so dumb why cant i just speak my opinionwhich involves bashing others for their opinions what does your opinion matter more sounds pretty egotistical to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this reminds me of rihannas shut up and drive vid loved her ever since
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,diablo mami to esa culva y yo sin freno

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,coño manito lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chris brown teenage heartbreaker deadly assault
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just to save people some confusion chris brown didnt get involved in a shoot out or something a lot of these posts and clickbaity news article titles are making it seem that way he allegedly pointed a gun at a girl the police came and he refused to let the police in for a while before coming out and giving himself up edit i just wanna clarify that i am in no way defending him i think chris brown is scum i just want to save people the disappointment of googling this and finding out that its not as exciting as it first seems
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats actually happening with him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hope to see more record scratch memes i cant get enough of this joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what movie is this from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i was gonna be nice id say this guy cant get out of his own way but the real truth is that he has serious and dangerous temper problems he has no control over himself and the longer he is left to his own devices the higher the likelihood someone will get seriously hurt or killed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,allstar by smashmouth starts playing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah dave chappelle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on the next episode of everybody hates chris chris dances in front of the judge and gets hours of community service and another tour

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,next saturday on fox chris browns how i hit your mother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats that tv meme doing here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man when there was that post that used a picture of chris brown in his prison jumpsuit so many people on this sub came out to condemn that shit saying that he had made mistakes in the past but it wasnt right to keep dredging up all the bad stuff hed done before some of you even called racism fuck that chris brown is a piece of human trash and this just shows that theres no coming back for him hes also a role model to many people and actively flaunts his wealth and success in my opinion what he did to rihanna as well as his blatantly homophobic behaviour towards frank ocean as well as all the other nasty shit hes done should never be forgotten and should be brought up as much as possible if its not then we go through the whole spiel again whenever it surfaces that hes fucked up again like oh yeah i just remembered chris brown is a scumbag cunt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game booty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at this point im just wondering if this is how he stays remotely relevant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so celebrities dont have their home raided when there is something like this going on mr brown doesnt want us to come in yet lets wait until he tells us so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dat trigger discipline doe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whens this dude going to grow up youre a millionaire in your start acting like it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hate this meme but this is the best one by far
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he hit rihanna so hard she forgot her own name oh na na whats my name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is so perfect just like in the movies spiderman nostalgia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh boy those duke boys are at it again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everybody hates chris
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what do they say about cocaine again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was super funny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i have a list of movies that actually start out like this now im curious but cant remember
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just not going to argue with a fucking idiot who puts words into my mouth so he can win an internet argument i never said the word rape youre just insinuating that im a chris brown sympathizer because i said that we might possibly not know everything we need to about this story all of the sudden im an idiot for saying this like me asking questions implies that im completely incompetent obviously you have some kind of weird tie to chris brown and his personal doings so nothing i say will matter anyways go revel in your self worth because apparently its godlike fuck you im done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess innocent till proven guilty doesnt apply to cb because he beat up rihanna
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so i have big hands and a galaxy edge some times the base of my index finger or part of my palm will touch the screen before my thumb does and it did so when i clicked this image to close it lol after reading it the screen just zooms in chris browns face out of nowhere like dam😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not as good as the bolt one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your literally unreadable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a shitty title and you should feel shitty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this wouldnt have happened in australia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,💩 title
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy fucking punctuation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk shit about chris brown but how is it illegal to pull a gun on people trespassing in your home isnt that basically the best time to have a gun edit fuck all yall down votin baby back bitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unrelated but anyone got a link to that flashback post where a guy didnt know about sex and his girlfriend got pregnant always hilarious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no we arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now im actually wondering how he got in that situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he also threw a duffel bag with drugs and a gun in it out the window while his house was surrounded
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he took so long because him and him boys were probably debating who would take the blame and for how much money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you left out the part where a weapon was found
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets hope its still enough to remove this piece of shit from society for a long time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he still can eat a dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from what i read on tmz is he told cops to get a warrant so the cops did and then he came out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you going to mentioin the part where he threw a duffel bag of drugs and guns out the window
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,after he threw a bag of guns and drugs out the window
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure he also tossed a duffle bag full of drugs and weapons out his home window
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he asked them to get a warrant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes being charged with assault with a deadly weapon he pointed a gun at a lady
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the best one ive seen his desperate look makes it work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id buy this meme for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are these a particular reference from a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep i hope its the new thing that gets big
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was funnier in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is his profile pic on instagram
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,google chris brown right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,paul blart mall cop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,takers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,civilization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think its from a specific movie or show its just making fun of your average cliche freeze frame
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone has been seriously hurt by him shes pretty famous too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thank you for telling us i will warn him immediately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it came out in an interview that he lost his virginity at age to a much older girl he was raped i really hated him after the rhianna beating then the story about the rape came out fucking conflicted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean im not saying he didnt do it ijs he just got custody of his daughter i dont see why he would fuck that up for something so petty seems like everybody is so mad about what he did years ago that hes already guilty and needs to be put to the chair i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who are you telling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you have to do that i mean you understood what was being said if you didnt you are clearly an idiot if it wouldve said ur would you still annoy us with that correction clearly this has happened to me a lot and i am just taking out my frustrations on you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for correcting the punctuation for creativity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont get too excited its ripping off another format
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao same man i got a case that prevents that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you comprehended it enough to correct it then it isnt literally unreadable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well yeah chris brown doesnt live in australia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they have guns in australia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it wouldnt have happened in greenland either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt realize we were in competitionno one in the us thinks about you guys or could give a shit what you get up to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they were invited
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man what would the word be like we didnt have that person that noticed grammar errors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dunno but breezy cant legally posess a firearm on account of domestic abuse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ray j white women baby mommas a recipe for a search warrant if ive ever seen one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone there was showing this girl diamond necklace cb got pissed about these hoes not being loyal and pulled a gun on her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so dumb should have flushed the drugs and stashed the gun somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is what im trying to understand some articles write this as he was surrendering the bag to the police but sometimes its written like he was trying to ditch it its not an official comment from police yet its just sources
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would love to know what drugs means that literally means nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your all fucking idiots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what this guy just has ndas sitting around the house for people to sign rich and famous people lead ridiculous lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its amazing how much that last sentence taints things for me when it really shouldnt she chose not to answer so its easy to say well you were doing shit you shouldnt have what did you expect then i remember that virtually every partyhangouttuesday night of mine has drugs and alcohol present and yet we all manage to not be dicks and pull guns on people instead were rational people who have fun and if theres drama we deal with it in a reasonable considerate way so i guess what im saying is that i really hate that last sentence because it feels like its there to taint peoples opinion the real last question should be what did you really expect when you chose to go to chris browns party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk man the way she makes it seem doesnt sound right i mean how do you go from being insulted by someone and then chris brown just pulls a gun on you that would be self incriminating and he knows it he knows hes not supposed to have a gun so why threaten someone with it and dont give me that well hes beaten a girl so i wouldnt put it past him bullshit theyre basically saying that brown pulled a gun on them just for pointing at the jewelry youre telling me that hed risk everything and garner this bad publicity all because they pointed at jewelry it doesnt help that shes willing to give up any and all info but if its something that would make her testimony invalid being under the influence at the time of the incident she doesnt want to comment and shes best friends with his babys motherwhom i know he hates so why would he invite her he didnt she tagged along and probably didsaid some things she shouldnt have in my opinion i think some things didnt go her way and she escalated the situation to shitcon which leads us here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,allegedly no proof to back up whats shes saying but if im wrong then ill do my best to give you gold
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pointed a gun at a person while being a convicted felon meaning hes not allowed to own any guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think ussain bolts was better but this one is also good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,best i can do is tree fiddy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its just a wellknown trope in tv shows and movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its particularly memorable from the movie limitless for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mostly remeber it from emperors new grove but other movies use it as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it is more recently from the movie dope maybe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bet original movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thought it was from memento
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this will fail
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not every meme deserves a sub but good luck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont worry i helped
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh thats explain a lot someone said he pointed a gun to a woman i thought thats the picture of him from the event i was confused thinking how the hell the picture came out that good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,talking about the picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its word for word from emperors new groove bruh edit with breezys name substituted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no third times the charm so after this major manager around with swat hell change his ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love how much people pretend to know about celebrities based off seeing them on tv or on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,snitch button
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anyone who will listen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who r u tellin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that isnt even close to the original meme ive got a bunch saved on my computer but im in bed and its super comfy so ill get the memes tomorrow for you but trust me theyre very dank
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still thats how memes work it doesnt put a dent into the funny factor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,great username
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres onea celebrity actually dr chris brownkinda looks like clark kent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but not the retarded gun laws you dumb yanks have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but if you are asked to leave and you dont thats tantamount to trespassing edit you cant use force on someone who was initially invited but they are most assuredly trespassing if they refuse to leave
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really if youre charged with domestic you cant own a gun edit why am i getting down voted for not knowing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not even in a duffle bag full of drugs is that a state law thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not saying hes correct for doing so but thats exactly what it was shes wanted for grand larceny in new york
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saw one of the videos he posted tweakin hard as fuck what am imma do next fart a elephant bro what are you saying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not a felon but would hiding a gun in a fridgefreezer work lol can any past or present cops people who got their house searched confirm seems like a decent idea depending on size to put in a box of ice cream sandwiches or something similar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how the fuck dont you know what drugs means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sooooo sameole sameole for chris
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its youre smarty pants
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i will never understand chris brown apologists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,makes senseso much stuff gets leaked if you accidentally drop some important info just get them to sign easy way to avoid something that could take complex litigation to solve otherwise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id do it thats like to get written by a lawyer and you can print like copies it pays for itself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its kinda standard now because so many people have done stuff with celebs and then go on to sell the story trying to make a buck but when they tell the story we dont know if the story is true or not because theres no way to confirm it yet they still got a payday its created a parasitic culture because the masses want drama so from the celebs perspective its best to nip that shit in the bud
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you realize they can get in trouble for people saying that there were drugs and underage people at their parties right if you didnt know someone but still wanted to chill fuck then maybe get them to sign an nda the first few times to know theyre cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre supposed to do it when people enter your house and honestly you should do it as a normal damn person whenever strangers enter your house otherwise shit goes down and youre almost always liable because it was on your property
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she probably didnt expect him to put a gun in her face and force her to sign an nda to get her shoes back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh btw the guy asking her was a tmz reporter so its not like she was really required to answer anything for him lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she said she didnt want to throw the other people under the bus the look on her face said yes we all know those things were present but i can respect her choice to not fuck over everyone else even tho she kind of did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who doesnt go in a hot tub with at least some booze
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drugs and alcohol tend to amplify whatever you are if youre a gun toting hood rat youll be a bigger gun toting hood rat if youre a chill fun dude youll be a chiller more fun dude i know theres always those rare ones that do a complete in personality on drugs but above is true for most people and we already know chris brown is not the cool headed type the real last question should be what did you really expect when you chose to go to chris browns party his or some other famous persons dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,going out to parties with drugs and alcohol is extremely rational
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drugs and alcohol is a pretty wide category i imagine the cops will disclose it in a report if charges are brought
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he knows hes not supposed to have a gun so why threaten someone with it because he has the impulse control of a toddler
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes people can be that illogical and it isnt bullshit to say that a man that has a known history of violence particularly aimed at women when relating to a story of gee said man once more being violent towards a woman like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and dont give me that well hes beaten a girl so i wouldnt put it past him bullshit im sorry but hes done a hell of a lot more than just beat the shit out of rihanna march brown is charged with felony assault after an altercation with thengirlfriend rihanna the incident leaves her bloody and bruised and photos of her battered face are leaked to the public brown pleads guilty is sentenced to serve five years probation and hours of community service in aug he is assigned an additional hours to be completed before the end of his probation on aug march he makes headlines for smashing a window and storming out shirtless of the good morning america studios upset that host robin roberts asked about rihanna during his interview june brown and rapper drake are accused of prompting a bottlesmashing brawl january he gets into a fight with singer frank ocean in a parking lot at hollywoods westlake recording studios according to police who were called to the scene the fight allegedly is sparked because brown parked his car in oceans spot with rumors circulating that ocean dissed rihanna and that brown called ocean gay slurs and threatened to shoot his entourage in august a member of oceans entourage filed a lawsuit against brown saying he suffered a concussion and is seeking damages may brown is charged with a hitandrun after allegedly crashing into a car driving away and refusing to provide his name drivers license and insurance info he later turns himself in spending about an hour in jail he pleads not guilty and the charges are dropped in august after brown reaches a civil compromise with the other driver june a woman accuses brown of assaulting her after his show at a california nightclub she alleges that he shoved her to the ground badly injuring her knee brown later tweeted i didnt do anything but then deleted the tweet the accusation was dropped when the nightclubs reps stood by brown saying that they never saw him push or touch anybody oct brown is arrested and charged with felony assault after he and his bodyguard allegedly attacked a fan outside of the w hotel in washington dc in the police report of the incident the victim a male named isaac parker says he tried to get in a photo that brown was taking with a female fan and that brown punched him in the face in response this doesnt even include anything hes done since because honest i cant be fucked to look any more but you get the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people are doing the downvote train because of the standard antichris brown reddit hive mind but objectively speaking her story does in fact sound fishy or like theres some parts missing coupled with the fact that she went to the media less than hour afterwards to do exclusive high production interviews you can see google the one on extra and it gives the impression that there may be ulterior motives here i saw that extra interview she says that the guy is showing cb the jewels she goes near the jewels then gets pushed back towards the exit then cb comes into the room and pointed a gun to her head how can he come into a room that hes already in im not saying it didnt happen im just saying someone else also sounds like it happened the ryan lochte incident showed me how easily reddit can hop on the bandwagon of totally unconfirmed information and condemn someone so im choosing to remain objective here until further details and actual official facts from come out to be transparent i dislike chris brown personally even though i still turn up to his bangers in the club cant tell me that these hoes aint loyal didnt go hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea it just doesnt sound right some dude just randomly flipped out and pulled a gun on you for looking at a piece of jewelry theres definitely something shes not telling us like maybe she tried to lift some of the jewelry got caught or did something she wasnt supposed to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk why this is downvoted really you think one of chris browns hoes would lie how dare you everyone knows chris browns a dick but that doesnt make this girls story make sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do my best its four fucking dollars if your best cant come up with you have some serious fucking life problems
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it didnt happen period
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that usain bolt one is def the best one yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where is it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that ones def the best especially when he even looks at the camera lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah i gotta track that one down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really i could have sworn it was referencing something specific and went to the comments to remember i want to say a kidfamily show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,war dogs which literally came out a couple weeks ago starts off this exact way so i giggled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha thats the first thing i thought of that and the tv show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what they said about rstarterpacks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,takers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how dare you presume to know what hes like based purely on some measlyass consistent unrepentant pattern of abusive incidents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cri evrytim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aint no tellin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idntve seen this kind of grammar arguments on reddit before look it up it exists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chris brown is a convicted felon he cannot legally own or possess a firearm and yet here we are what australian law would have prevented him from illegally acquiring a gun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not leaving after being asked is definitely not trespassing pulling a gun out on someone you know because of some disagreement is almost always going to be assault with a deadly weapon you have no reason to ever draw on somebody unless life is being threatened with another weapon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its also illegal if he cant own guns because he is a convicted felon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im assuming thats a felony and felons cant own guns from what i understand or vote but im sure that is much less important to chris browns everyday life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not just charged convicted and do you seriously think its a good idea to let violent felons own guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean seeing the results right here i feel like its a very sensible rule
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe because if youre deemed a violent and dangerous individual it unsafe to let you own a gun i am not saying that chris brown is going to kill somebody but after what he did to rihanna i dont think he should be trusted with a gun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because you are on reddit and its loaded with fuck faces
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit is a bitch thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre convicted for a domestic you cant even lay a finger on a firearm even when i was in the military i saw guys get kicked out after a domestic conviction because they legally werent allowed to lay a finger on a weapon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats pretty crazy isnt the right to bare arms one of our constitutional rights doesnt make sense to lose those rights to a felony where that right wasnt even part of the felony imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when my dad got arrested for attacking my mother last year they took all his guns i thought that was awesome
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he wasnt just charged he was convicted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must be new to reddit lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it depends on state law but dont quote me on that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just fyi when buying a gun if you have to say yes to you pretty much cant legally have a gun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because duh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way you phrased it makes it sound like you disagree with the notion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup surprise surprise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes gotten a few other charges outside of dv
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,edit why am i getting down voted for not knowing because youre not black enough s guys s calm down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikibradyhandgunviolencepreventionact section has the specific terms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes gotta get smart and have his muscle handle those situations source marlo stanfield was hard to get because he had partlow do his wet work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea he was definitely tweaking well i hope it all works out for him in the end he should make better decisions im not buying the girls story but chris is dumb for tossing that bag out the window hes gonna do some time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he has a massive house im sure there is a few inconspicuous places he could hide something tossing the stuff out of the window was a dumb move
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drugs could translate to ethanol alcohol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not trying to defend him really i mean the dude is shit for beating a woman but i feel like of what we know about this story is all speculation and im not one to jump to conclusions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit i can relate to that inference i lived on the same floor as a guy who really shouldnt go anywhere near alcohol considering he had gotten arrested for public intoxication and a week later got really shitfaced and was generally super aggressive and not fun to be around at all the dude legitimately would give a girl a rambo thousand yard stare for calling him on his bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seriously did he not know that hes also not supposed to beat the shit out of women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh that makes sense no wonder the judge granted him visitation of his daughter cuz hes mentally unstable come on now chris baby moms tried to extort a month in child support and demanded that he have monitored visitation rights because of his wild lifestyle and drug abuse but even the judge thought she was crazy and that chris brown was a good enough father that she threw the case out so i believe if he was mentally unstable then a judge would see that and he wouldnt have rights to see his daughter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what was reddits response to ryan lochte
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even if she did try to lift the jewellery or whatever what does it matter he still possesed illegal firearms and threatened a person with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit you were there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how did it go down seeing that you must have intimate knowledge of the situation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a kidfamily show many of them which is why its such a relatable meme maybe youre thinking of slumdog millionaire though or city of god
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre canadian whats with andy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the one youre thinking of is likely emporers new groove that said it was practically every other movie in the late so who knows
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rob schneider
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the jersey did it almost every episode
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it was used in deadpool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres no variance in the record scratch meme at least start packs can be creative
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i saw in this thread people claiming the girl is lying which i agree is possible but the greater possibility is the guy with a history of unremorseful abuse continued his pattern
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was expanding on udopeymcsnopeys sarcasmthe parent comment wasnt a joke i know you guys like you jump on the whoosh train but damn at least figure out what my comment says
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they used magic to turn every gun in oz into a didgeridoo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not saying what he did was legal but if you are asked to leave and you refuse then you most definitely are trespassing in he eyes of the law and can be arrested the whole castle law about shooting trespassers is out the window the second you invite someone inside initially but they are definitely trespassing if they refuse to leave when asked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes really go look it up you cant use force because you initially invited them but the cops will most definitely come arrest someone who refuses to leave your home because they are trespassing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it depends on the state
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,domestic abuse is only a felony if you do it more than once dont ask me why it doesnt make sense to me but thats how it is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guillemot criminals dont get guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even a misdemeanor dv conviction is a lifetime ban
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its apparently ok as long as youre a police officer they will even make you chief one day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id say its a terrible idea to let people in general own guns let alone give them a constitutional right to own them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes nra
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fuckery that comes after this comment is upsetting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you serve your time go through a supervised period after in which you behave and show you are rehabilitated then yeah you can and should petition the courts for your rights back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but its unconstitutional to deny them that right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they do it in america
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree was just asking a question
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if a convicted felon is considered a violent and dangerous individual even after their sentence is served then why do we let them out of prison at all it just blows my mind that we strip away an individuals rights and make it almost impossible to get a job or even get welfare in many cases and then were upset by recidivism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it depends on state law but dont quote me on that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres no proof that this isnt what happened white girl distraught by crazy chris brown is going to get attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really your not buying that the guy with a history of violence to women would be violent to a women
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well yeah im just wondering what genius places that people think of usually are the first to get searched
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably because he was messed up at the time too no he looked completely strung out in that video he posted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was a bag filled with pepto bismol hope that clarifies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have you ever talked to a person irl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was filled with the good stuff extra strength tylenol pills shizzzzz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not sure what that has to do with anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but you arent a fucking lawyer or judge or jury you are on an internet forum if there is one place to completely pickfork speculate and judge mercilessly its here what kind of ownfart smelling highhorse riding smug toolbag do you have to be to choose this conversation to take an entirely meaningless moral position i seriously dont understand the motive behind defending people like chris brown and bill cosby on some super fake ass innocent until proven guilty type shit you arent a legal system you arent the court of this land you get zero props for being sotechnical and pedantic and shit lets hope its still enough to remove this piece of shit from society for a long time thats what the op said perfectly normal where you responded with your all fucking idiots like who are you what compels you types of people to be so fucking contrarian that you wouldnot defend but reeeee over someone saying that seriously where do you people come from they should make a superhero called captain contrarian von pedant that come riding in on his high horse to remind people that in a very bureaucratic technical and irrelevanttonormalconversation type way we are innocent until proven guilty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah dude living with or around those kind of people is the worstyou can smell the alcohol from a mile away they always show up without a shirt muscles flexed and skin more red than a tomato literally a girl repellent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at first they were all like it was probably real rio police that robbed lochte because its a third world country lul
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt say chris brown is innocent yea he definitely commited a crime by having a firearm as a felon im just saying im not buying that girls story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no i was thinking more a along the lines of a sitcom that used it as a consistent opener and literally used the same wording like everybody hates chris or something im sure im wrong it just elicited such strong déjà vu that i was sure it was on the tip of my tongue and for everyone claiming that it is such a common trope i dont see anyone giving any examples if you google it an routoftheloop post comes up where some seem to believe its the equivalent of dead unicron trope needle scratching is definitely common but its the wording that had me trying to remember
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im a trick playing gangster an artist a prankster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ever visited rthestopgirl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whoosh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so youre defending chris brown
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think so too its insane does it stay that way forever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is it insane this person is so unstable that he beat a women to a pulp i dont think we need his opinion to move society forward im not even including all his other issues with being a law abiding citizen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the constitution guarantees that ones rights cannot be deprived without due process of law a felony conviction is that due process most states include the revocation of voting and gun rights in their felony sentencing statutes and most states also allow convicted felons to apply to get their rights restored
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it makes sense the right to vote is based on the assumption that you uphold the social contract a felony is a crime that is considered heinous enough that you have deprived another person of their rights to life liberty or pursuit of happiness and can therefore not be trusted to uphold the social contract any longer if you cant uphold the social contract you dont get a say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh so now you want to shoot woman huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was asking a question reddit doesnt take kindly to that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how dare you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clearly youre a rapist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok there mr i hate all joy and wish death upon every man woman and child on gods green earth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so would i but there are a lot of american redditors that will disagree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see the americans have come by and down voted you cause duh freedom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,say that when i pistol whip the shit out of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually guns are good and cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,statistics arent your strong suit i see
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even the nra agrees felons shouldnt have access to guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nra
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nobody argues for convicted felons to own guns though many organizations do say preemptive restrictions of people who are not yet convicted shouldnt be mandatory
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre thinking of terrorist watchlist the nras complete disregard for human life and disgusting pursuit of self interest stops only when black people might get guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre a violent offender you shouldnt be allowed to own a firearm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not in california that state doesnt believe in gun rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,edgy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,felons arent allowed to have guns until a certain amount of time passes by after completion of their sentance depends on the state to how long that time is for example its years in texas and years in louisiana
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if a person is convicted of a violent felony please note the violent part then fuck yes they should not be allowed to own a gun even after time served
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i think they should have those rights because that is a good way to keep them from going back to jail but i think guns are a specific issues that needs a different approach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,judging by the comments thats the story reddit is running with and you cant tell them otherwise youd think niggas would learn not be messing with these unvetted white girls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the alleged victim keeps changing her story and she is wanted for questioning for a theft in ny so dont really buy her story of just trying to take a look at some jewelry in chris house hes no angel but her story of how a gun ended up in her face seems fabricated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no whats it like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that dph
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,spelling is for honkeys apparently
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo check your fucking usernames before you write a goddamn book you smug piece of shit i wasnt the one who said your all fucking idiots i was just throwing my two cents in but just because i dont like you in gonna tell you to hop off of your high horse and stop trying to impress people on a fucking internet forum no one cares how high and mighty youre trying to act
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,emperors new groove
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these posts are extremely common in rmeirl there was just one the other day where somebody posted a youtube link or something with a ton of examples of this theres absolutely no way to find it on that sub so i wont go digging httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainrecordneedlescratch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there was a recent sitcom that used it in every opener it was called cooper barrets guide to surviving life i found it fairly entertaining though im not sure it is getting renewed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a common trope in moviestv shows just not memorable moviestv shows we all would not know of it if it was only specific to one show mate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or rcatsstandingup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,choo choo motherfuckers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends on the state i think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its one of those weird partisan issues where on the face they say it is about being tough on crime or about citizens rights in reality excons usually vote democrat so its used a tool by both parties to try and swing elections none of them actually give a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not in all states in some yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it does in iowa our aclu chapter tried to fight it but they got shot down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more or less yes in some states you can get felony records expunged after a time keep in mind though the no voting rule was around a lot longer than drug laws when anything considered a felony was a heinous offense and no one plea bargained
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know man i feel like the right to vote is so fundamental that all people are entitled to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because we dont want the government able to take away anyones voting rights because it has a possibility of being abused
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if felons are not allowed to vote then there is no incentive for politicians to protect their rights or work on behalf of that constituency
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the point of sentencing is to both punish and rehabilitate a criminal to fit back into society denying them a vote after release does not accomplish those goals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not sure if this is true but i heard that not allowing felons to vote was initially done o stop black people from voting either way though there are a lot of people who have felonies for nonviolent victimless crimes and they still cant vote either doesnt seem right at all to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she gave him the herpes doe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because people dont have to be defined by a single act of wrongdoing in their lives or period of wrongdoing people are complicated and they can change maybe they were wrongfully convicted even i dont think they deserve to forever be stripped of their right to have a say in their government note im not talking about this specific case but just generally about the idea of felons not being able to vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this guy thinks politics is all sunshine and rainbows lulz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where did you hide her body dwayne
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no shoot women as in all of them boooooo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he doesnt have tobecause of the implication
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now now skeeter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got a pitchfork for times like this €
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the constitutional right to own a weapon is very highly regarded here if you ask anyone whos ever actually bought a gun theyll tell you how much you need to do before you can get one on your hands an overwhelming majority of gun violence is from stolen firearms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its in the constitution of course you got downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh its much better im also a stuffing dicks in my mouth stalin and an idiot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well arent you an angry lil fella
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,said the dorito covered armchair warrior
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,keep reading
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is possible for a convicted felon to get his gun rights restored but it takes a good bit of legal work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you kidding the absolutely do argue for convicted felons and domestic abusers to have guns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you know how many people are incorrectly put on the terror watchlist because they have a generic name that lots of people use as a fake name a fuckload my concealed carry instructor is on the watchlist cuz his name is joe thompson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the nra has spent a lot of money to keep guns in the hands of domestic abusers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if your a repeat violent offender then no you shouldnt if you made a mistake when you were a teenager figure your life out and become a productive member of society and can prove that youve changed then i think dont see anything wrong with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are no gun rights if youre a felon anywhere in the us unless youve been pardoned and restored your rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a joke im referring to the fact that bad people always somehow end up with a firearm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i was rich and had hoes around theyd be signing ndas to even get in my dms lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even if she was in the process of stealing his jewelry that doesnt excuse him pulling a fucking gun on her all he had to do was fucking ask for it back literally of people will cave when confronted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,edifying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eat a dick and dont stick your fat head in a conversation if you dont want to get talked to and besides the last part where i quoted that other guy everything is the same you said but i feel like of what we know about this story is all speculation and im not one to jump to conclusions and i said but you arent a fucking lawyer or judge or jury you are on an internet forum if there is one place to completely pickfork speculate and judge mercilessly its here what kind of ownfart smelling highhorse riding smug toolbag do you have to be to choose this conversation to take an entirely meaningless moral position i seriously dont understand the motive behind defending people like chris brown and bill cosby on some super fake ass innocent until proven guilty type shit you arent a legal system you arent the court of this land you get zero props for being sotechnical and pedantic and shit and all that shit stays exactly true im sorry i confused you for a different chris brown dick rider
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the one i was thinking of
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit sluggy freelance i completely forgot about that comic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never gets old so hypnotic hope shes happy rn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you honestly think i did that for the free karma like im some kind of karma train passenger no sir i just like the sound my fingers make when i type that word onto this thing im looking at
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,here in wisconsin once youre released from parole they reinstate youre voting rights not sure about others but im sure were not the only state like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a really racist assumption to make
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel its a right to be taken very seriously voting your opinion should be respected on the highest level although at the end of the day you are either pulling society forward or holding it back this person has showed a repeated destructive pattern which leads me to believe i dont want his opinion shaping our future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the right to safety and the right to not get the face beaten in by your boyfriend is more fundamental and chris didnt seem to mind taking away those liberties
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,freedom is a right every citizen is guaranteed but you lose that right when you break the law voting isnt really something that you should be allowed to do if you cant control yourself from breaking a pretty simple law
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree with you at a kneejerk level but the more i think about it i dont really care for the idea that everyone felon or not has a say in government policy too many people with the wrong information shouldnt get to make decisions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually thats the big problem entitlement your right to vote your right to bear arms in fact even your very citizenship is ultimately conditional to some degree for most people in the us becoming a citizen and being able to vote was easier for them to do than getting a drivers license and often accomplished with far less work or concern plenty of things could be improved with requiring at least the amount of difficultyinstruction it takes to get a motorcycle license to become a citizenlegally own a firearmvote even if born here entitled people get things whether they deserveappreciate them or not and some things really ought to make you work harder for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it should be an earned privilege simply reaching age without murdering anyone isnt a high bar for the citizens of a country
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slippery slope and all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a single person has so little voting power that i doubt the government is gonna go around arresting people so they cant vote theyd need to arrest a lot of people to make a difference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this the young black male simulator everybodys been talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they tuk ar jerbs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know if it differs by state but im in indiana and i literally ordered one online and then picked it up at a gun shop other than entering some information in online and signing a paper when i picked it up there really wasnt anything to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont really have an opinion on the second amendment either way but you have to have someone to steal it from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,huh you mean wait for the background check to clear and then hand them the money or your credit card you know its incredibly easy ton get guns in some states right and an overwhelming amount of gun violence comes from legally purchased firearms that are then resold on the street or when someone just buys the gun for a person who cannot pass a background check virtually every crime gun in the united states starts off as a legal firearm according to thenbureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf director bradley buckles in seconds of research could have led you to that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah the hard part is convicting them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and a lot of money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol bro the article you posted specifically stated that they pushed to restore gun rights ro nonviolent felons only in what state is dv a nonviolent offense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre charged as an adult you should not get to carry a firearm you made big boy choices live with your big boy consequences
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah gun violence in la is nonexistent now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because a gun is a privilege and not a right in most of the world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do we not allow pedophiles near kids or schools
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did chris brown beat you too your parents should have fucking hugged you more as a child youre a sad angry little man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not a right if it can be taken away its a privilege
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my country they even vote in prisons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly cant tell if this was a s post or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,talking about a general law though even if there is a guy who you think holds society back there are guys who learns from his mistakes and betters himself but that doesnt matter because there are laws in some states that says convicted felons cant vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but then you run into the issue of unjust laws what if someone cant vote for breaking a sodomy law or for drug related offenses the first one has been repealed or overturned in just about every state or is left on the books but not enforced the second were just starting to come around to the idea that drug addiction is a disease thats better treated than criminalized not only for the individual but for society and while those people are disenfranchised who is their voice its not a privilege its a right thats how a democracy works otherwise we could have majority voters criminalize any number of things and disenfranchise smaller less privileged groups
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if the person changes themselves should they still not be able to vote youre saying that people like malcolm x should never have to right to vote i dont think he was charged with a felony though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and yet when it comes down to the final two choices even chris brown isnt going to vote for donald trump edit a shot at donald trump is being downvoted in rblackpeopletwitter proving that there isnt actually any black people here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at what point do you draw the line then if someone falsely reports abuse and the defendant gets convicted should that person really never be able to vote again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right only i should elect the president am i allowed to vote for myself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you serious entitled bruh you were born with those rights they are the natural laws of man you dont have shit granted to you the government doesnt give you anything they can only restrict what youve already got
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your kinda argument against for fathers of american philosophy people like john locke and thomas paine will like to have a word with you bruh inalienable rights rights youre born with is a basic concept in which this country was founded upon and it was founded upon because its a primary argument against british controlling a group of people without even being from the area the basic premise is that if you were born to a land you should have the right to have say so to what happens in that land at he very least moreso than guys who arent even from around here this is what happens when people dont pay attention in history i learned this shit in grade you have to know the past to be able to build the future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so who should get the right to vote then and how can you ensure that a system like that wouldnt be abused how can you be certain that all groups of peopler regardless of their ethnic background religion social class gender etc would have the same possibility to gain the right to vote who are supposed to control it and ensure that there wont be corruption involved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,weve been through a time where that explanation was used to ban blacks from voting just by being black but it was disguised as aptitude tests theres a video of harvard students taking one of these tests and the questions are just rediculous to say the least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look how disproportionately black americans are arrested and jailed and charged with felonies so when you consider that its actually pretty fucked up that felons lose their right to vote one single person has little influence on nationwide elections yeah but on a large scale we are talking about essentially suppressing the black vote which is the same thing gerrymandered districts and voter id laws and other limits put on voting are often designed to do yes theyd need to arrest a lot of people to make a difference and they do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,answer the fucking question
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you are wrong they did a background check on you they take that information on the sheet you signed and run it the last one i did they called the fbi and gave them the info for them to do a background check you just werent paying attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you paid for two different background checks when you go the online route they may have just not made it clear what you were paying for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we cannot penalize people for having their property stolen and misused if someone steals a car and kills people with it should we blame the original owner i do agree that we need some more gun education on how to keep your own guns locked up safely but not much besides that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not the magic answer that ends gun violence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean after they call up the fbi who does a background check not to mention the guy said stolen firearms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know its incredibly easy ton get guns in some states right if you have a clean record yes and an overwhelming amount of gun violence comes from legally purchased firearms no less than of gun violence occurs with a legally owned firearm httpgunlawscomillegalgunsillegalgunsstatistics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually youre allowed to condemn all the opinions you want thats the idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea you can say whatever you want doesnt stop me from saying youre a dumbass though to be clear you have protection from being arrested for your speech not from other citizens criticizing you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont you know free speech is only ok when it aligns with their views
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpgunvictimsactionorgnewsviolentdomesticabusershavegunrightstoonra those mistakes theyre talking about is domestic violence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can see that side of the argument not that i completely agree with it but in cases of juvenile felons who are mainly charged as minors especially i disagree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there are parts of la where everybody has a gun those are obviously the safest parts of the city
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,self defense is a human right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because you cant rehabilitate pedophilia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what i thought dumb motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who the hell are you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair plenty of rights are taken away when you go into prison prison by definition reduces your rights but i dont think voting should be one of those rights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do it for the culture they gon bite like vultures
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree but theyve been doing this with anything mainstream for like ever black culture is just mainstream now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,zip it up and zip it out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stay woke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,always see this happening they want to profit off us but put us down when real shit occurs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats just black twitter not literally fucking everything remotely popular

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,buy a scrapped vehicle under a salvage title rent the same model of car and get the insurance swap everything thats needed when you take it back to the rental place angrily explain that after only ten miles you broke down because the alternator fuel pump radiator battery rear axle passenger window frontleft quarter body panel and three tires went out demand your money back as compensation for them renting such a poorly maintained vehicle to you edit i refer to this as the rental car of theseus strategy of automotive restorationhttpsenwikipediaorgwikishipoftheseus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aye i stole this necklace for you bae
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where can i rent a toyota camry asking for a friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the smartest thing ive ever heard just rent a car for every months and get brand new tires genius
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,would would this work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,girl he gave his bro your good tires and gave you some old ones dont fall for this again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this idea is firestone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would you make that public knowledge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,itt how to commit fraud
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i was in college a friend had to rent a car while his was in the shop a few days stoned out of his mind he decided to go to pep boys and buy two of the shortest wiper blades they had i think they were inches or so he put those on the rental and threw away the ones on the car all the time giggling to himself that someone someday would rent that car on a rainy or snowy day go to use the wipers and have a functional area the size of a paperback book at the time we were laughing our assessment off looking back it was probably a bad idea and could get someone hurt but thats year olds for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,her name is literally carrot in arabic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for some reason i have to believe they mark their tires somehow to prevent this but at the same time im not sure i should give anyone that much credit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a friend of mine once bought brake pads changed them buffed the old ones put them back into the box and brought them back to the store no idea how he achieved it though he equips himself with camping gear every year and is able to return most of the crap after our week if done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he should have switched the whole wheel rather than just the tires its easier that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now watch rental companies get wise to this but until then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people treat their rentals like shit im not sure if she got the better end of that deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,work for a major rental company can confirm this happens or attempts happen a lot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chivalry is incarcerated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol what in the living fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my how illegal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a friends dad did this with his company government actually car the company car had much nicer wheels so during his lunch hour swapped them on his car he chose a university carpark to do it though and the security guards saw him and were over zealous and thought it was suspicious they called the cops who called the government department and he got busted didnt even get fired he just had to swap them back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i work at an enterprise and this would work i dont check tire tread and i dont know a single person that actively does in my whole region literally nobody could give a shit about that happening to a couple cars in your fleet they make money off of those cars ten fold and a new set of tires is already factored in if it became a consolidated issue specific branch or area than it would be something the managers would address but it never has been it would have to be very obvious check it for damage and thats it unless youve destroyed the inside at smaller rental places budget sixxt etc this may not work a big company like enterprise doesnt care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is why i love recent i saw this same post on facebook and the comment thread was a shitstorm of self rightous drama and trolls on reddit they teach you how to do it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chivalry aint dead almost people playing it right now more than battleborn jeezz people take game population to seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn rented a car a couple years ago and was driving with my family when we got in a pretty bad accident thank god no serious injuries but the car was totaled accident happened when it was raining and we swerved a little left to avoid a car on our right and suddenly the car was spinning out of control because the tires were bold and had no traction just thought it was negligence from the rental company but it couldve also been someone trying to impress their boo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rental car companies wouldnt notice this one day the car has tread and the next day it has tread plus dont tires have serial numbers couldnt they just write down the serial numbers edit fixed tire tread measurements
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like theft to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait is this a thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what on earth makes her assume the tires on a shitty rental car are going to be brand new
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just remember thislike most fraud and crime its all been done before these rental companies have had it done to them many times you might get away with it but if they do notice they will figure it out pretty quickly all these companies have security departments and they could file a grand larceny complaint against you a felony that carries up to four years in prison not worth it the prisons are full of people who thought they were the first one to think of things like this if you get caught its not worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can someone explain this to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and there goes that trick now that everyone will know about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,saw this on instagram and facebook over a month ago we need to step up our game bpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you would probably get away with it once in time if enough people did it you could go to jail not worth it your car also has to be one of the handful thats available for rent which means recent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to work at enterprise rentacar a car not to long ago hopefully they didnt charge for any damage if the mt did a proper trunk to trunk inspection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure this was a lpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,relationship goals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn just damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scandalous but clever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stole her heart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,serious question for anyone that works or worked at a rental car company are pictures taken of the rented vehicles before each rental like what if i rented the same car and swapped out for oem rims
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this right here should be in lpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is so romantic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what happens when you try that and the tires were already swapped by someone else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i read this hours ago and just now got it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just got practically new tires for at my local junkyard also didnt commit fraud but fuck what do i know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn thats a good idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is genius
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think that would work with the tpms
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,question do they need to be the same brand tires also wouldnt they noticed the name on the side of the tires change
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats genius
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,careful some car rentals implant rfids in each tire just kidding i have no idea if they do this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you may have newer tires than before but your name is literally carrot in arabic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,renting companies check this when car returns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i heard a story of this one guy who worked at an automobile factory in the he snuck out different parts of the car during his shifts took him about years but he eventually got the entire car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a really good idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt chivalry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats genius in a criminal thief kind of way my tires are each maybe i should try that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sure people will appreciate this when someone has a tire blow out causing a fatality the tires only get replaced on schedule and tires that are near bald wont be noticed for the most part enjoy killing someone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is some really ghetto ass shit right here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,would be pretty easy to mount a tracking device inside the tire or wheel wouldnt be surprised if they did this now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit thats good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til being human garbage aka a thief is romantic lol edit human garbage disagree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo mad props dis lifehack shocked everyone in dis thread so much dat dey fogot to talk ghetto lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why the fuck do women never do romantic things for men people go on about chivalry and how men have to be romantic and show their woman that they love her but why dont women have to do that too why dont women have to show that they love their man is it because they dont women dont love their partners or its it simply a given
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,couldnt she just ask the rental place to swap the tires i mean if they were probably bad it would be on them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah hey i just rented this lincoln mkz from you guys anyway im sitting at the light and it started to sputter a bit so pulled in to a gas station and when i popped the hood release it turned into a shitbox rustbucket with a dead hooker in the trunk i got the insurance though so i just bring it back in or
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then hire a really good lawyer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally every piece has serial numbers on them how would one get around that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a beautiful edit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats salvage yo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this sounds like a kramer idea with george costanza implementation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so isnt this just fraud may as well just steal cars if youre going to break the law like that much less work higher payout
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hertz learned this lesson with the h
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i knew a guy who would rent a car drive it down to mexico and sell it then hed come back and report it stolen not exactly the same thing i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the passenger window part was just beautiful put a big smile on my face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rentawreckcom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does anyone know where i can find a rental truck with some good mud terrains
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til you can get all sorts of stuff for free just by stealing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too lazy to look up but one of the big rental companies made a partnership with ford to rent out the gt mustangs with the big engines and people ended up renting them and switching out the engines with their regular mustangs and returning them edit adding some info because people keep commenting the same thing it was hertz it was the ford it was it was called the hertz racer it is a very famous story that changed cars and rental cars its a famous story and as a result these particular year and model of mustang that were used by hertz sell for sometimes above on used market
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the smartest thing ive ever heard edit somebody pmd me nigga how many times you gone use this gif you know i replied with the gif
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,highly unethical though i mean there are genius things to do if you abandon all principle like that fake resume trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it sounds like the smartest thing ive ever heard until you get caught and get charged rental car company replacement costs also that goes away after a year or two when the rental car company gets rid of older models
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well theyd only be new tires if the rental agency had recently replaced the tires or it was a new car and with how ive seen people treat rental cars youre likely better off with just getting your own tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga dats rape theft
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well new for you anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does yolonomics mean yoloeconomics
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i worked for enterprise for over years most of that as a branch manager i can only comment on how things worked in my area but generally the cars got cleaned and rerented so quickly that the odds of someone catching tires with lower treads on them would have been extremely low all we were taught to do was a visual inspection for tires with super low tread depths and that was only to avoid potential liability in case a tire were to blow out during a rental for that reason most of these inspections only occurred during the rental process not upon check in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they do inspections when you turn in the car something wrong with the tires they charge your cc for new tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and this was the last we heard from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its also fraud so theres that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well if shes dumb enough to think you can just go rent an caprice she deserves it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if he was cunning and unscrupulous enough to do the first thing hes definitely capable of that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,🔥🔥🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,remember when firestone tires had a bad habit of tearing apart and blowing up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for the retweets bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not fraud if you dont get caught source iamnotalawyer theres a acronym for that but i forgot edit wow guys im really flattered but im not in to that sort of thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,laughed so hard at this couldnt even read it to my wife wo having to stop laugh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait so could i take the wipers off my friends car and replace it with blades
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah they definately carve their initials into the rubber
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is definitely a dot code on the tires the likelihood of them being identical is far fetched also rental cars go through tires pretty often and dont always replace them with the same brand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,employee here we dont care our station agents are semiretarded hillbillies theyd never notuce this sort of thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most camping retailers ll bean comes to mind have a no questions anytime return policy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to work at one of the big three four coporate auto parts stores if a customer brought in an obviously worn item or one they clearly broke themselves we were instructed to tell them no once if they insisted then just do the return they were all about the customer this was about five years ago so im not sure if thats still the case
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tires arent difficult to eyeball and figure out if theyre in good shape or not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre tires not transmissions as long as its round holds air without too many problems and balances okay youre all good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you have any checks in place to stop it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they could they probably dont most people arent that thorough with their work especially the years they have inspecting cars before and after renting them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dropped off a tahoe a few weeks ago all nervous because it was pretty dirty dude takes seconds to walk around the whole car then says to leave it running while someone else hops in and drives it away to the back lot im not sure if that was the whole inspection but if it was it was pretty easy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they absolutely wouldnt i was tearing through some dirt road in florida in a rental chrysler and hit an unexpected bump really badly and tore off the sump guard and scraped the shit out of everything on the bottom of the car just tossed it at the next service station i got to and didnt report it nobody noticed it or the scratches to the paint i got from bushes or anything never charged for any of it i mean i think most places just dont really give a fuck tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why on earth are you using are a measurement are you from britainstan do you buy things in shillingpence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why out of of all numbers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when youre dealing with a fleet of cars you dont remember things like tread wear id imagine its not even considered when checking a car in or out they look at the body the odometer and the fuel gauge in my experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah just with charged to their credit card after they bring the car back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqhowtochangeatire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tires could cost easily each so a set would be rent a car costs less than a day swap the tires and you got new tires you could either switch the rims or not depends on what set up u have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hell no i dont work at a rental company but i was renting a car last weekend at a small town enterprise and i went in to get my car but they didnt have any returned yet so i waited outside and had a cigarette guy pulled up and went inside to return him and the agent both came out to inspect then went back inside two minutes later he came out and let me know the car was ready didnt clean it didnt do anything the car didnt move the whole time and from my point of view a minor viewing was done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who downvotes this lol i got you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,howd he get the frame out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was it johnny cash ie one piece at a time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think hertz rents veyrons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we dont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get out of here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no shit for real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you sure
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they do all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,find a woman then you will know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why the fuck do women never do romantic things for men many do just need to be worthy of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you bastards rented me a reject decepticon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,go to home depot in the morning and maybe you can piece one together with migrant laborers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thatll cost you more than the parts would have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,play dumb and say you live in a bad neighborhood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people actually did this with the old hertz shelby mustang gth it was a special edition made for hertz rentals with a more powerful engine than the standard gt people would rent them and swap the engines with their gt and bring it back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in reality only a handful of parts have serials the engine tranny body in several places and sometimes parts of the electronics have serials like stereos and alarm systems there are white papers from the manufacturers that you can find that show where each one is for the police
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no they dont source i work in parts for a large dealershop group
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally every piece no not literally every piece
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no one would check source worked at enterprise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i doubt they check the serial numbers on every part every time the car is returned maybe the last guy to rent it was the one who pulled all that shit or maybe it was the guy before him could have been anyone anyone i tell ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no no they literally dont theyre part numbers could you imagine the logistics of putting the vin of every part of your car when something brakes or you smash your car and a shop replaces it source i work in parts for a large automotive group
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think hed ever do it himself regardless
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not every piece and often times theyre not recorded the only numbers that would be tied to the vin would be the engine block number and maybe the transmission the rest are just random serial numbers no one would record or be tied to the vin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i work in the rental car industry its pretty easy to modify cars we dont open hoods unless its to put in window wiper fluid and we just change tires when ever they go below no questions asked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,very few parts have any meaningful serial number on them and almost none of that would be helpful or available to the rental place other than the vin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the oem serial numbers or numbers put on from the rental car place theres no way in hell theres a matching serial number on every part
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpsyoutubehbbbowvftxq
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no they have part numbers on them so they will be the same if the parts are oem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kill the attendant at the rental place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it possible to scratch off the serial numbers edit thanks guys i think thats enough answers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,run
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but i bought the insurance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not as bad as you think the only way this wouldnt work is if they refused the return
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and they check the miles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my relatives works in the insurance industry all agencies have fraud investigation units he has told me numerous stories about people lighting their cars on fire organizing accidents and even having friends steal and dump their vehicles trying to get new cars some guy changed his policy to cover theft and the car was stolen that same day insurance companies dont take fraud lightly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you explain that im interested edit nm that storys all over this thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,such a simple life hack too cant believe i never thought of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there was a post on rlifeprotips a while ago that was basically put candy bars in your soda when youre at a gas station so you dont have to pay for it then just fish it out when you get back to your car so steal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til you can rent a car for or you can just steal it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was in like the with the original ford mustang gt and i believe the company was hertz it was called their rent a muscle car special or something so people would rent the gt then switch the engine out with their baseline mustang this was back in the day when swapping an engine was a plug and play experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre talking about hertz and that was literally in the mid people were doing this with the original shelby gth rentaracer people would also rent the car on friday pull the engine friday night and slap it in their own car race it on the weekend pull the engine and slap it back in the rental only to be returned monday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre thinking of the hertz shelby gth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably the shelby gt mustangs they did a limited time rental on them and afterward they were selling them for like used after being rental cars some friends and i rented one in la for a trip we were on and all i can say is i wouldnt want to be the owner of that car when we were done with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they where called hertz mustangs they are worth bug bucks now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was hertz in the i used to work there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hertz with the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hertz mustangs thats a classic story
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,einstein dont have shit on marquis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish i could give you a second upvote for that edit 😂😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fake resume trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unethical no plain old criminal crime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah keeping in mind tires have dot numbers that identify them as part of the sidewall i dont know anything about rentals but i imagine they record the dot numbers at some point and could probably find out if anyone paid attention to the tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the probably dont change the tires every single model year i think it might be kind of a red flag if you requested a specific year though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jeremy clarkson said the fastest car is always a rental
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also if you take a look at what tires are on your rental youre likely to find they are shitty brandquality anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plus couldnt you just get the insurance and be covered
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a former enterprise employee i can tell you that it is very unlikely that they inspect the car that closely most of the time they will have their car preps who range in age from inspect the car and i cant remember a single time i looked at the tires long enough to notice a swap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think theyre talking only about the rubber tires not the rims in which case an inspection is unlikely to reveal that youve damaged the car in any way normal wear and tear could be claimed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i work at a small hertz this would literally work at my location
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the secret is to do it before your tires are obviously fucked up badly no one is going to notice the tread has gone down a few millimeters that said switching the tires seems a lot harder than just switching the wheels if you can get away with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to work for one of these companies budget after every rental we are required to take note of any damage to the car gas tank level and mm of each tire measurement of the treads in millimeters so yeah if i give someone a car with a recorded level of and its returned with and they only drove miles somethings up i already have a credit card on file with a deposit and a drivers license so theres no way anyone would be getting out of this one in short if the above story is real i almost guarantee he was caught when he returned to the shop as long as the workers were doing their job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so it has no risks you were going to have to pay for a new set anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lololol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,giving away our secrets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ianal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ianal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its fraud i assure you there are just no legal repercussions and the best thing to do if you are able to get away with something is by not specifying what you did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,definitely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just carve the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rei used to until dicks abused it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same goes for ya bish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes we do and we catch most of them however sometimes its easy to miss some of the obscure things like tire inflator kits or a rear sway bar for instance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we dont have the capacity for that sort of thing most of our stations are already understaffed in the fist place station agents wont go looking through every part of the car to see if its been replaced they just look for damages if theres none its all good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my friend rented a uhaul truck and for some reason he thought itd be a good idea to exit his apartment complex through the entrance gate while it was still open rather than just wait for the exit gate to open needless to say the gate closed on him and scrapped up the side of the uhaul truck really bad like large black streaks of paint from the gate he took returned the truck later that day and nobody noticed or if they noticed they didnt give a shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because im a dumbass and meant type
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know what youre talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get out i already left the building days ago fam smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,men are the ones who buy flowers who are expected to arrange anniversaries who are expected to do romantic surprises who stereotypically write songs for their woman an so on the word serenade literally means a man singing a song under the window of his beloved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rejecticon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you failed me yet again starscream
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can piece together a really good lawyer with a group of mexicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because people who steal parts off your car always take the time to put on a broken replacement part
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre white that might actually work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not gonna upvote you because is appropriate upvote cause you must be high
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,itt someone is going to try this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the dumbest idea ive ever heard make a very powerful car and rent it out willy nilly we already know a rental is the faster car but for hertz to actually offer a more powerful shelby is just idiocy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did they ever get caught
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,smart but seems like a lot of effort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm heard the same thing on rjustrolledintotheshop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iirc it was like more at least for the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hold on i need the check the serial numbers on your brake pads headliner and drivers seat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,figuratively every piece
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but what about the blinker fluid tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your water pump gasket doesnt have a serial number on it risky stuff bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah these people are really overestimating how organized and motivated rental car employees are i used to work at budget and people would take the plates off rental cars and put them on their own cars to get free gas i once gave a customer who had reserved a minivan a jeep wrangler because it looked like it was going to rain and i didnt want to put the top up im sure i had a minivan lying around somewhere once we had an older customer complain that she couldnt get her subaru outback to go over mph she had been flooring it in first gear with the shifter in manual for a week we cleaned the car and sent it back out the next day without a mechanic even peaking at it we used to lose cars for weeks at a time until someone thought to check the back lot at the airport where people often returned cars at night by mistake if someone returned a car and complained it was shitty i would just assume that they were right because most of the cars were shitty because people abused the fuck out of them as long as it was the same make model color plates and general body damage i sure as fuck would never bother to check the vin much less the serial numbers on individual parts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hang on gotta check to make sure the serials match oh never mind they all seem to be scratched off i guess youre good to go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,serial numbers can be restored through acidic processes if they were truly interested in knowing the number the metal under the original number will maintain the imprint even when the surface number has been scratched off at least on guns i assume its the same for most metal items with serial numbers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,could just be a sticker or a metal tag on some parts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not usually even when scratchedgrinded off there are still ways to xray acid dip or magnaflux the part and read the serial sometimes also the vin is in a lot more places than just the firewall engine and a few stickers on the car youd have to completely strip the car down to find all of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we had a hail storm recently and some people tried to take advantage of the situation by throwing rocks all over their car in order to total it most likely they were underwater with payments but all they did was fuck themselves over more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lifehack to get a promotion murder at least one person in the position you want
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is everything called a life hack now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,life pro tip stop drinking soda and eating candy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so use half the space of a drink im paying for to steal a dirty candy bar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i was in high school that was how i used to shoplift makeup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its only dumb if the rental place realizes it which seems unlikely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was a loooooong time ago like the or
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,problem solved switch engine report rental car stolen make sure you have there insurance
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you might think that but they didnt keep track of the serial numbers on the engines when they were returned so it was a while before someone realized that the engine was switched out and by then it was too late to really do anything about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its called a vin located on the engine and a few other parts of the car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont even need to look at the serial number to tell the difference between a and a strait six
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can swap the visual parts from the hipo to a normal you wouldnt be able to tell easily
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was the rent a racer program and the cars werent just any gts they were
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what swapping engines didnt use to be the biggest pain in the ass why are engines so fucking hard to swap now a days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they announced they were doing that program again with the new
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why not just race the rental
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the new one the old one was the hertz shelby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thx mane the three gifs people are tired of me using is this one steve harvey gif and the trump one people are also tired of hearing i went to school with tpain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think hes talking about posting a fake job on craigslist then collecting the resumes and checking out your competition but that would be a fake job trick more than fake resume so i could be wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fake resume trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it might be the one where you submit a bunch of shitty fake resumes around the same time as you submit yours so yours looks good in comparison
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i assume it involves submitting a resume that is really really outstanding for a job to find out how much they would pay you or something like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right help out some of us less ethical people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me about this fake resume trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah probably honestly they might record them when they get them changed but i doubt the guys returning those vehicles care anywhere near enough to check when you bring it back by the time they realize man these tires wore out really fast theyll have already rented the car to another hundred people and will have no way to tie it back to you im not willing to be the guy to risk that they check when i bring it back though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think the insurance covers fraud if the agency were to expect the tires had changed their underwriters would send a fraud investigation team to the claimants house and do a thorough investigation i imagine that if a person with whom you associate closely has the same model vehicle as you the unit could obtain permission from a court to check the vehicle i dont know the lengths they go to but i do know insurance companies take fraud really seriously even if it seems minor as switching tires might seem to some of us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the damage waiver technically not an insurance policy only covers physical damage to the vehicle it wouldnt cover the switching out of tires and as far as investigating fraud that would be far too costly if i had gone to my area manager and claimed that someone had switched out tires on one of the cars he would have said theres no way to prove it take the car for new tires if they arent at a safe level and oneway that car someplace else if you can it sounds sketchy but we got cars returned all the time that had been onewayed from other branches the branch that returns the car has to keep it on their books while it is in the shop getting fixed so it just sits there not earning revenue and it costs them bonus money for that month
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol at hertz i literally just look at it to make sure theres wheels and no missing pieces
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i still work for enterprise fml its the worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes but you also arent renting out a chevy cruze either youre renting out a midsize which happens to be whatever midsize is on the lot at that time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they just look for damage that wasnt there before and they check mileage and gas gauge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if it goes from a new tire to bald and cracking in one day im pretty sure that wont hold up as normal wear and tear in any court especially if the tires have numbers they can track on them and they find them on your girlfriends ride edit tin on a tire is for batches and not individual tires but can identify if you have a different batch you swapped with if the rental place doesnt check properly then thats on them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a rental bonus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing happened to me except in my case it was a taco bell burrito in the glove box
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or he just didnt rent the car from budget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if they only require a deposit couldnt you just get a prepaid debit with that amount of money on it still cheaper than a new set of tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,til dont pull this stunt at budget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats assuming that they dont overcharge the shit outta you they dont ban you from the rental company and they dont get their legal team on you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love how it transforms him into a shirtless badass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nsfl that shit christ
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,defiantly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,daaaamn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she has a glandular problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hold him back damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre assuming the kid gaf enough to check
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre not a dumbass you just have typographical shortcomings from time to time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,women typically do those things too television reality
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is not the preferred nomenclature
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup as a lawyer i can confirm that im actually just a stack of mexicans in a long shirt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone stole my sisters transformer and she only knew because her car suddenly started acting up she took it in and they told her that someone switched it out apparently it was fairly common with the type of car she had edit probably not the transformer idr the name of it but it was something under the hood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont know the crackheads in my neighborhood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chivalry isnt dead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sorry i didnt know i couldnt do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they still do this with a hertz version of the vette the corvette zhz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except ford had shares in hertz and hertz was basically fomoco rent a car the publicity it gave plus the markup for the best branches did good on a marketing purpose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but insurance exists for a reason for those for a company it probably wont affect them much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if were hearing about it now im guessing they did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,swapping engines in classic muscle cars isnt all that difficult if you have the right tools maybe a few hours of work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same as any other swap effort wise that is otherwise just muuuch cheaper
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,figuratively every piece no not figuratively every piece
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i prefer serialized rtv
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah good lord i cant even imagine checking a serial number sounds like you and i had similar experiences we gave out free days and cars to folks all the time for obvious lies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont see a problem theres
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the ballistics lab technician
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get your manager piss drunk and convince him to go on a boar hunt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what we say in my work place is cut towards the senior guy its a move
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as usual the best lpts are in the comment section
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill drink all the soda and eat all the candy i want thank you very much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it shouldnt take up that much space if you just grab or but like why wouldnt you just put it in your pocket if youre going to steal anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but you also get whatever was on the outside of the wrapper in the remaining half of your drink so it works out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you put makeup in a fountain drink what store sells both
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really what im thinking on this most people working in rental car places like at the airport are paid near minimum wage and dont give enough of a damned to notice the tires or even the alloy rims vs hubcap wheels
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah that crack rental company staff checking serial numbers on engines
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyd have to realize it on time so that means they would have to check all the serial numbers after every rent probably they dont expect the engine to be swapped and check its serial every time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,breaking the law is only dumb when you get caught ever wonder why we cant have nice things whats dumb is thinking you are entitled to someone elses shit the did the same fucking thing and you probably got all sorts of pissed off at them if so you were only mad because you didnt get all that money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually it seems pretty likely to me the car would sound drastically different with another engine and considering they work with these cars every day they would probably know somethings up as soon as they turn it on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was gonna say seems like swapping an engine in a modern mustang with all the elecronics and such that must go with it into a model that originally came with the or ecoboost must be a pretty expensive operation even if you dont acquire the engine legalls but an older one ah yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they started doing it again httpswwwhertzcomrentacarmiscindexjsptargetpageshelbygthjsp httpswwwhertzcomrentacarproductserviceindexjsptargetpageadrenalinecollectionjsp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats just stealing a car though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup thats right they were some bad ass motherfucking cars i know that at least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,electronic control units that dont work with everything a plethora of sensors to detect a fault direct injection carburetion a ton of shit got more complicated its why you can have a engine that gets highway when back in the day that shit got like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,emissions control you used to be able to switch out ford engines with just about any other ford engine same with chevy with other chevy but now even a few years differences can be a completely different ecu and sensor package to keep up with all the emission laws and regulations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the wiring harness and fuel rails go everywhere back in the day it was just a carb and a few wires if you want to see some great engines go look at toyotas they look like a rats nests
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,back then probably because you had a dedicated drag car just short an engine although im sure people did also race them these days im sure in certain areas rental car agencies have people at the track keeping an eye out for cars they own showing up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that just seems smart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,checking out the competition nah you steal their resume template and swap their info with yours
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,resume fake trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then they respond to some of the shitty ones with fake names and ignore your good one inexplicably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why the fuck do i need years experience in data management when i just want to sell someone a damn stereo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it means putting fake shit on your resume genius
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hype up your resume and put everything the job posting is looking for in it of course youre lying your ass off but youll get a call back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly lol if i cant find a scratch or a dent im marking it as good because it is too damn hotcoldwindy to be outside
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my mom just returned a car to enterprise today that she broke the handle of one of the door off she literally sat the broken handle back on the door so it looked normal while the rental guy did a once over inspection on it i hope they charge the mess out of her lyin ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i ask you what you do there by chance i just graduated and i have been going through the interview process for a manager trainee position
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah you gotta get lucky but if the wheels are the same size see tire wall for markings youre gucc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt it great to live in a world where you have to assume everyone is a piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never rented a car somewhere that inspected the tires that closely they mostly just look for paint scratches dents carpetupholstery stains and the gas in the tank of course all this is moot since you usually cant request a specific model anyway just a class of car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive sold tires sams club and far as i know there is no tracking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do people keep stating that rental cars have new tires do they replace them after every rental or something is this a new thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless they left sugar free gummies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shirtless corpse that guy ded
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so bad ass he doesnt need his right forearm which got blown off from the expulsion of air dear lord the way his bone hits the bottom step
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it didnt kill him or anything in the video he gets back up dazed with a bleeding arm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the nicest thing anyone has ever told me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,women may occasionally do it but not anywhere near as much as men do and they probably only do it out of obligation cant help but feel like women dont even care or love their partners
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre out of your element deceptichum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,asianamerican please
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you must not be a very good lawyer my lawer is a stack of mexicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,take this upvote and get out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,says here on the dmvs site you have a same model car registered under your name what a coincidence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and so it was written
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the neighborhood is not that bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chivalry isnt dead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so kenm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,common courtesy chuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ha id love to see someone try file a police report for an alternator swap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,autobot or decepticon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alternator
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idr the name of it but it was something under the hood that narrows it down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,transformeror one of those parts that come from under the hood my last mechanic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hear things get spotty when you switch out an autobot for a decepticon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alternator yeah they are quite expensive when they go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck kinda car is she driving
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was wondering if it ever would be worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cash that privileged status out for some sweet roll
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always turn my music down when talking to the police i dont want to get my ass beat to a soundtrack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dave can i tell you something i did know that i couldnt do that laughs maniacally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i stand by my original statement that thats a bad idea people are going to beat the shit out of these cars although i can see how its good publicity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so the engine isnt any different why would people swap them like said though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you never know they could have found out well after the fact and just reported it by that time more people could have rented the car and theyd never find out who did it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,metaphysically every piece
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every shitty job ive held when it came down to a maybe of the time im going to give you whatever answer means the least work for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my close friends worked at enterprise aside from paying minimum wage they regularly work them past their scheduled hours or have no one to cover when its busy and its their lunch break comes up thats not even legal here but i guess most people just take it the worst part is that they overbook cars so every time a cruise ship pulled in shed have at least one person yelling at her because theyd rented the car theyd reserved and paid for to someone else this happened weekly in the summer i doubt shed shed any tears over someone ripping them off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really those rental places dont have any staff to maintain upkeep on their cars or do they contract it out to the specific dealers i wonder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they could find it months later and track down the previous owner of that engine if the guy is stealing cars and swapping engines thats harder to trace but a dude who swaps with his own motor would be easy to track down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive heard of selling crack but renting it seems like a shit business model
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i doubt it they need the serial number and a call to ford for the vin of the car that left their factory with the engine then who bought it and then find out if theyre the current owner or sold it the partial vin is also stamped on the engine to match to the current vin location and time dont really matter if the guy was dumb enough to swap in a motor from a car he owned at some point tracking down this stuff isnt hard records have to be kept for recall purposes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and my axe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for the idea bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lpt steal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im very sure the dmv has nothing to do with this at all you would have to call the manufacturer of the engines and try and obtain their records of where the engine was sold if they kept records they would not help you at all unless you had a subpoena for the documents required even then keep in mind that the person who bought the engine was probably not the person who rented it and they would have to prove that he was involved with the scheme if it was me i would simply say that i sold the engine for x amount of money to a random person for cash and i have no idea what youre talking about with the switching engines bottom line was they really needed to check all that stuff when the auto was returned and since they didnt and multiple people had possession of the vehicles they were shit out of luck unless they filed insurance claims
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scratch off the serial number on the swapped engine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the rentaracer engines had the vin stamped into them because they were the special high performancek while the regular mustangs did not have the vin stamped into the block this was before when that however changed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man by the time the dmv got back to you both cars will have languished in a junkyard for years at that point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and a engine that makes more hp than a big block from the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also ups power quite a bit and crate engines without all the tech are usually rated by gross horsepower cars and installed engines are rated by net horsepower net hp usually falls between the gross hp a rule of thumb is usually cars today are rated by net hp pretty amazing how much power some of these cars are making base corvette engine gross net corvette engine gross net corvette engine gross net corvette engine gross net boss mustang gross a lot net
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,direct injection carburetion sounds like a good source for automotive information
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks obama
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now the computer in the car will eat you out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,time to get a name change then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all that audio data bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no hes probably referring to making a fake job posting of the job you want then collecting resumes of people applying to see how you compare to them can also figure out salaries by asking those people what they are looking for and what they made at their last job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit if its a beater you could key that bitch and idgaf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i went tho the management trainee position for a year then went into the selfinsured auto adjuster work enterprise does look good on a resume only because companies know that you are worked hour days days a week you have to play the customer is always right motto you will ruin every suit that you wear and your tie will get caught up in the vacuum when you are cleaning your only car on the lot when its degrees out with people in the building waiting for a rental vehicle they have an extremely high turn over rate i would recommend looking at the facebook page called things i learned at enterprise you will see true employees talking about things they use to do but the adjuster gig i have not is a lot better then the management trainee but compared to other insurance companies i am not being paid enough we lose about employee a month to other insurance companies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh i disagree with the person you initially asked ive worked at enterprise for over a year and its a great company to start your career at they dont low ball their employees and give them lots of training you do work long hours hours a week typically but you are working with people your age for the most part and most of them are people youll get along with the first year is hard work no doubt you can get promoted fast my manager has been with the company for under years hes a branch manager and makes over a year once you start running a flagship branch or become an area manager you can make over if you become anything over an area manager you stand to make a lot of money and there are lots of opportunities for that after your first year there you get over two weeks of paid time offvacation time and if you cant make it in for some reason even on short notice the managers ive known have always been understanding they give you health dental eye etc and a that they match to i live in the ne and get great discounts to all types of stuff in nyc boston etc enterprise has good relations with lots of other big businesses banks and tech companies that travel a lot its not the perfect job but i wonder why so many who work there complain about it i think it has a lot to do with what area of the country youre in im in an area that has a nice expensive fleet that servers a wealthy demographic we rent exotic vehicles and are always ranked one of the best regions in terms of revenue and customer service there are absolute garbage regions for enterprise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is a manager trainee but honestly if youre worried about it im a salesoperations recruiter and hertzenterprise are great companies to start a career at its great for your first years then i would suggest looking for somethin with a bit higher pay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did that straight out of college do it for a year or two to get some business experience the pay is shit you are their bitch and will just be a monkey in a suit trying to sell insurance coverage and upsell rentals a typical day will be the front runner telling you go pick people or cars up show cars and do rental contracts nonstop and deal with the pissed off customers who cant believe we dont have a lot with cars for them to choose from it sucks ass but its a job at least pass the grill which is like a test after year or so to see that you are learning the front end of the business you need to know a bunch of info about the basics of running a location then theyll do some scenarios that are basically loselose to see how you handle it and what decisions you would makeie they grill you pretty hard haha oo if you pass you get promoted to management assistant which means basically nothing but you have something to put on a resume other companies actually have a lot of respect for the enterprise system and it will look good that you put in some time thats probably your best benefit this was like years ago though for me so i dont know if its changed but i doubt it since the company is so old fashioned
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats gucc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but if the wheels are the same size see tire wall for markings youre gucc there are different bolt patterns hub sizes and offsets theres more to wheels than diameters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right unless theyre recording treaddepth after each rental and assuming youre swapping the exact same brand of tire its likely this would work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont need the time and hmmpph theres no record keeping never has been but theres always been plenty of determination on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just because i lock my door at night doesnt mean i think all my neighbors are axe murderers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some places let you go out into the lot and pick whichever car you want love those locations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i meant that theres not much they can do not that taking their stuff is the correct thing to do i shouldve used a different saying but its already there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not saying that they do properly track them but there is a way to track the batch number in the us by using the as i mentioned theyre required for purposes of recall and maybe other things but i didnt read everything by the dot plus they could have other data tracked automatically on the vehicle automatically when you check out or during inspections like a camera automatically taking pics but not sure if anyone does that or as others pointed out if it would even be economically viable to do so
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never meant to indicate that they all were new like just bought and put on just that they are much better like new compared to worn out tires and maybe it seems exaggerated a bit if theyre not in significantly better condition then why even trade them out how often do people state theyre new edit changed a few things up within min
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt know this was a thing im assuming murica
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah he gets up and walks away he did get cut up pretty bad though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn ive seen that gif before and never noticed that his hand just gets blown off fuuuuuuuuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it doesnt pause and it goes from flipped out to tucked towards him in a shadow you can see when if you pause it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just rub some dirt on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,impeccable logic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well chivalry isnt dead so theres that youre welcome dont hit that snitch button
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my gf cooks delicious food for me all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your lawyer has the higher rate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my cousin benjamin says otherwise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so let it be written so let it be done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as is tradition
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i live in a slightlyunpleasant neighborhood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is indeed the title astounding observation my good sir
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no its a turbo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe it was an electric car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those fucking thieves always stealing my motor mounts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like a flux capacitor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really that expensive less than and less than an hour of your time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was an alero now we have it shes had it since and it was bought used the alternator was stolen about years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,🎵were not gonna take it🎵
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people are going to beat the shit out of these cars being that theyre limited editions for a limited number of retailers id wager that the insurance on the cars make it worth more than the car is worth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt matter how much you beat the car up youre liable for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hertz offers a dream car class where you can rent aston martins ferrari lambos whatever the fuck you want pretty sure there is a or hold they place on your card first
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because he didnt give all of the details the rented car was a special edition shelby its rumored that people took the engine out of the shelby and put them in their personal car for better performance at the track whether or not they swapped the engines back before returning them is up in the air and i doubt that most of the people working at hertz at the time would have known the difference anyway edit and i think uredlinetogreenland may be talking about the newer gth that hertz is currently or very recently if theyre not still renting and not the ones from the that the story was about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,twist they all swapped out the engine too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the one who has a mustang gt registered in their name i would imagine most people dont get the same car they drive for a rental
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt the vin on the replacement engine that seems like a good place to start investigating
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look for wear on engines dafuqare you stripping the engine down on returns
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn your job is strict wheels all panels
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so if a car was returned with old tires on it would you question them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not like they broke it and it has to get fixed right away like the people who were stealing redbox discs and printing returning a scannable label the next person instantly knew the average joe renting a car likely wouldnt know the difference between the more powerful engine or not to be able to report it right away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whatever happened to upoorlytimedgimli
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,runexpectedgimli
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah this is rfrugaljerk to the extreme i mean i guess its advice but i try to make sure at least most of my advice does not involve felonies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my vw has the cars vin on the engine label
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youd need purchase receipts and make sure you claimed that cash to the irs and also werent in possession of the in your car motor pretty easy to get a warrant to check the motor on the car if the serialpartial vin visible from the undercarriage they probably dont even need a warrant really not hard to track this down and the rental agency wouldnt be doing it cops would be basically the only way this works is if youre stealing cars swapping engines and selling without title or stealing cars to just steal the motor to put in a rental and leaving motorless upgrading your own motor then selling your old motor for cash but if youre already stealing cars probably should just steal the gt version
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also adding that you dont die after a crash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a focus st makes more horsepower than a mustang gt with a quick tune around dollars it can make more torque as well mustang gt liter stock focus st liter turbo stock mustang got focus gets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never heard the term net hp before is that the same as wheel hp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,upvote for knowledge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wouldnt the just be around since the net is around of the gross
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my cyl tacoma hp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im sure the ladies love that feature
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they just referred to the fake shit on resume trick the fake resume trick is actually way more efficient you just
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have a slightly below average sized penis
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gonna borrow your girlfriend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the day i got fired from enterprise was one of the happiest days of my life no shit the boss felt bad for having to fire me but i gave him the hey no big deal i can snatch up a job for the same pay relatively quickly dont worry about it man speech acting all coolslightly disappointed inside i was jumping for joy i guess i couldve just quit but i didnt want to be a quitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,space between your balls and your asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gucci
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless theyre recording treaddepth after each rental and assuming youre swapping the exact same brand of tire its likely this would work they barely wash them let alone remember to check if there are tires on it at all at least in my hood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive rented cars before and id be impressed of the bored kid behind the counter even went to see if the car still started
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the tread depth has decreased significantly oh right i mean i was doing burn outs all day yesterday in the local grocery store parking lot so i guess that must be why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont even fill up the tank anymore theyre most likely not going to check tread depth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea wheni i drop off rentals they have a person look for scratchesdents and then accept it i really doubt theyre inspecting tread depth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if theyre doing tread depth theyd definitely record the batch number since thats easy can probably do it automatically for the most part but you both are correct they probably wont check unless everyone starts swapping tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeahe assume everyone is a piece of shit is not the correct assumption its completely and totally faulty the correct takeaway is that you have to assume there are enough borrible people to make it worth the trivial time invested to keep your belongings secure and your property protectedand thats all i understand this is just a different way of looking at the issue semanticallylogically but thats a massive difference in the lens through which you view all of reality it is genuinely unhealthy for your body and your mind to hold such a dark and negative view of the world its poisonous in a number of ways most notably in that it will influence your other views and color your perception of any other topic at any other time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but they still probably only have at most two or models per class
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not your fault that lots of other people are saying new sorry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the video is actually pretty funny afterwards some old guys come out and are like oh look theres blood on the ground wonder how that got there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh my fucking jesus his arm fell off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so what did he do wrong how does one slash tirles correctly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did not notice either but on the other hand now he can go allin like that guy from blade of the immortal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would it be nsfl or nsfw even
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she eats it too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does he have a twin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to kill the firstborn pharoah son
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that guy quoted the bible in response i thought it was a recess ref
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they dont think it be like it is but it do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so mote it be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so say we all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httptransformerswikiacomwikidoubledealer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im fairly sure that if her cars turbo was gone it would be doing more than just acting up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the light said check engine so i did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,burned plastic or tire smell coming from the vents or the front grille at best blue disc brakes and exhaust system if they have a bit more time is my guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oil analysis im guessing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you might realize when youre checking the oil hey this one engine looks different than all the others we have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow yeah then that seems pretty exploitable thanks for the answer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i drive an audi wagonthe hell do i know from a mustang or if i rented one both are way more powerful than my car i probably put my foot into it a couple times for fun go fuckin hell and return the car a few days later without having any idea i wasnt driving the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he broke down like years ago and stopped or that might have been uexplainsthejoke or whatever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the focus is also a bit lighter but believe me the lack in horses is made up in full by how fun a is drive another bonus being that its not a focus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope net is the engine with the alternatorpumps fan attached still recorded from the crankshaft
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no gross hp is horsepower at the flywheel before transmission without any accessories added net hp is horsepower at the flywheel with all standard accessories added alternator ac pump etc etc also referred to as brake horsepower especially across the pond which is why you hear this term a lot on top gear officially termed sae net horsepower wheel horsepower is as its stated horsepower at the drive wheel after accessories transmission and drivetrain added also referred to as power to the ground
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but you know what i like more than knowledge
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get down sniper fi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my favorite foxworthy jokes youre damn right i want the insurance you have a ford fiesta thats about to see more airtime than a skateboarder at the x games
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah you still have to own a copy of shitty rental car but if youre considering swapping tires out to save money youre not looking to rent a bugatti or anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two things that was some manner of very heavy vehicle i believe military that had unusually highpressure tires use a tool thats not six inches long like stand to the side and hit it with a nailblade stuck in a baseball bat or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on the other hand well he only has the one now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but he just asked his brother ulysses who also agrees with him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im creeping death
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im creeping death
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all hail king bob
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no i quoted sir james hetfield off the song creeping death however he did use that quote from that movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,art thou chuffed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if ya wanna get real obscure theres punchcounterpunch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup still there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,point being is that engines dont wear and tear like the rest of the car on the outside you cant just look at it and go oh yeah its fucked for sure in essence you affirmed what the other guy was saying about car rental employees not knowing what to look for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mom great news im going to be a criminal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the user history is right in the comment you replied to he pops up every now and then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes still around just not in the same capacity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,solid point lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly the type of cars where you can probably specify excty what you want to rent probably arent the ones owned by people who are looking to swap tires
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,die by my hands
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomqrghjlljpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shhhhhh the original theory made you seem respectable and cool just say yes next time you hippie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i work in megacorp retail loss prevention dude if you guys knew what i knew you wouldnt pay for anything ever americas big business economy works based on the assumption that people just dont steal much even if you put it right in front of their face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tomorrows advice mallard or til if you are thinking about changing out the tires and parts from a rental to the same model car that you own dont you could go to prison
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive very rarely had a problem asking for a specific type if they had it in stock i usually ask for the ford products cause theyre light years ahead of shit like the nissan versa in drivingentertainment features
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know ive met people who owned camaros that could barely afford rent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he looks like a dothraki barista
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,image makes me think if he ever thought about being a pornstar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but why is my man being kicked in the balls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rthisismylifenow

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then you realize that hes only
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah dudes just hearing some classical era piano at all times even looks like a composer himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dudes a badass if i remember correctly didnt he pull himself up from some kind of gang life i think i heard hes a great story

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a porn star taller than lol they keep them short to make the dicks seem bigger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because flailing your legs around like a fucking ninjago is a natural motion that all teams do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because fuck draymond green thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my guess would be he went to block the shot and landed on his leg as they both came down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because draymond green is a dirty motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey man after the game they nba went back and changed that sack kick into an ejection

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im legitimately curious why does everyone hate draymond other than for kicking a dude in the nuts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he ddtd himself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like him the league needs heels and hes the best one since sheed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not a huge basketball fan but jesus christ that was a scum move yesterday they shouldve kicked him out of the season for that game seems like a joke when disgusting moves that try and fault other players are ignored
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too soon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im convinced he used to be a professional wrestler so hes used to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn lol im never going to be able to not think of this when i watch him play sucks too because i really like adams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup youngest of dad was a scumbag he got tied up with the mongrel mob one of the two main nz gangs until a mate of the family put him in touch with an american basketball scout who organised a training camp invite which lead to a college scholarship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whose happy place is cleveland
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sean connery not burtand for those wondering you really need to watch this film at least the post bond sean in sm leathers and then it gets weird

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dudes only
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes i think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that sounds like a hoodie allen line
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i saw ron jeremy a few months ago outside the andaz hotel arguing with the valet not sure how its relevant but its not not relevant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but does he get paid for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,porn stache
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not in my porn theyre tall handsome and actually fuckable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,solid ninjago reference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive seen westbrook do it and draymond do it before the whole balls incident
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is my new creed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mama there goes that man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you would think but no pretty flagrant foul actually
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in a fantasy world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,then youre fuckin right up if you arent reposting for karma too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but for real fuck that piece of shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never be excited about sports ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hoes gonna be hoes though bruh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same here last year i was all about seeing gsw take the titlethis year i switched to rooting for okc right after the dick kick heard round the world and despite the brutality with which they murdered my beloved hawks ill be fully on the cavs bandwagon this year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imo a one time unintended kick in the groin due to game roughness is more forgivable than numerous incidents of lebron floping i meanthey fine that shit for to grand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honest if lebron is gonna ruin our run at home like that fucker better bring it home for cleveland
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first he fouls and flails around a lot and in dangerous ways high kicks that consistently come close or actually hit other players in the nuts face etc pulled a guys arm last night in a way that could potentially end their season similar to the kevin love injury last playoffs seemingly intentionally tripped a player in another game this series straight up tackled a guy during a game a bit ago second he bitches about literally everything very loudly in ways that many other players seem to get technical fouls called on them he complains as much if not more than just about any nba player while getting away with significantly more dangerousunsportsmanlike behavior it seems hes allowed to do whatever he wants and the nba wont really punish him third hes on the warriors and theyre good it attracts a number of haters to begin with when youre defending champs and even more when the media has basically been riding their dicks all season and you cant escape constant talk about are they the greatest team ever and the like there is also talk and conspiracy that the nba was favoring the warriors by not suspending or punishing green coupled with that and his ridiculousdangerous antics in a hugely watched last series lots of people joined the fuck draymond bandwagon tldr fuck draymond green
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im guessing that one incident where he made a ruckus out in the teams locker room then apologized to the team its management
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,behold
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was so fucking glorious to watch

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont like this guys opinion of a basketball player hes obviously a failure in life and a worthless turd because he doesnt agree with me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,since when does pointing out a player is a honorless dickkicker being upset over being beat fuck draymond green gets paid millions and cant have the integrity to not be an asshole who tries to hurt his peers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more like an old school porn star
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rugby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kids wow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,crippling depression
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i used to talk to a girl from cleveland she broke my heart so i think thats legitimate reason to hate the city
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahaha yes sean connery i totally fucked up on that one lol burt reynolds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well he tripped kanter in game right if he gets that flagrant he gets suspended for game where he did pretty well its too late to cry now but fuck the association
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from new zealand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not not relevant how i started and ended my phd dissertation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,male porn stars barely get paid for it thats why they almost all do gay for pay shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you watching the gay for porn stuff where its guys trying to make it in the porn industry but can only get roles in gay pornographic moving pictures theres also a about it the link is nsfw incase you couldnt tell by whats being discussed no wangs shown on screen but your boss may start to question you some
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly wish him nothing but dissapointment from here i am a chicago fan and i want the cavs to win iwant draymond to never win anything again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wouldnt call flagrant fouls pretty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude plays dirty and then complains when he doesnt get a call
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least thats just one dudeunlike the clippers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unreal the only posts on the top are hate on draymond green while the warriors had one of the craziest comebacks from and both curry and thompson had multiple highlights
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its leaking everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can see it on your downvotes smh no mercy lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah one of the ten teams to come back from a deficit the team that got most wins in a season ever is overshadowed by a flagrant foul pretty dumb in my book i dont condone the nut buster but cmon thats pretty silly to say you want gsw to lose because of that also draymond is a fantastic player when hes not fouling the shit out of people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah fuck that fellow hawks fan checking in cant wait to see lebron get dad dicked in the finals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,such a dumb overreaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,had to turn my screen sideways for that one but it was worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its funny that he equates the team you like loosing with a failure like how many minutes did you get tonight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from memory the boys average and the girls average his older sister valerie won two olympic golds in shotput and having played rugby against one of the adams brothers i lived in nz til i was the brothers are fucking monsters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were not detroit httpyoutubeozzgajjuqzm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one should never be without a reason to dislike cleveland jk cleveland its tough to hate a place you more often forget exists at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okc won game though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well look at you now doctor telltogos
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well duh just like if a chick wants to make it in the porn industry she has to be willing to do ffm and ff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats because very very few people watch straight porn for the guys so they get paid a lot less my barbers got a friend who is straight but got paid bank to do gay flicks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same i hate draymond more than lebron now didnt think it was possible but i want lebron to win a championship and i want draymond to lose every game for the rest of his career
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hope all the bad things in life happen to him and only him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sucks that he probably will win
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk man id still smash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where is the ejection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude makes a hell of a sandwich though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its almost like he plays in the nba
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,solike the majority of people committing fouls in the nba
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,foh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you see him complain after grabbing adamss arm and throwing him to the ground and saying the kick to the nuts should have been rescinded he absolutely does
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,curry reminds me of jordan in his hay day he runs circles around teams and makes it look easy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also draymond is a fantastic player when hes not fouling the shit out of people when is that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i want them to lose because they represent the end of an era and the ushering in of small ballcollege ball even the announcers were talking about how gs was getting beat in every category but because they make all their they were winning the nba is pretty much drive and shoot or drive and pass for an open the midrange game does not exist anymore i feel bad for all these kids growing up who will never know what a real post game looks like i mean who even has a good post game anymore the ones still in the league have something in common they arent contenders
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty silly to say you want gsw to lose because of that i mean isnt it pretty silly to say you want any team to lose for any reason its not like he can actually impact the game with his mind im a hardcore vikings fan i want the packers to lose every single game because fuck them and i openly admit thats pretty silly of me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if green got the foul he should have he would have been out for any of the games he commited any of those fouls in probably resulting in slightly different results maybe not a win for okc but regardless green should not have been in at least of those games
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,draymond has been dirty as fuck all season long and has constantly gotten away with it i thought it was bullshit for the longest time but each time i respected him less and less until i just couldnt root for him to win i flipped to hating gsw when dray flipped marcus smart over his back he did shit allll year long that anybody without the nba plot armor would have been suspended for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im a warriors fan and im not liking his antics during this series either he should be called on this stuff more i hate getting away with things like this because it puts an asterisk next to our wins that being said there was a time where they called adams a dirty player
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know hitler was fine except for the genocide thing how are you ok with a player always looking to hurt another thats fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on my phone i cant tell what the picture is at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ascii art you retard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,losing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,watch the replay on that one adams ties himself in a knot with green
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,okc won game and
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is where i was going but apparently bpt doesnt like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thunder fan here you guys just now hate him guessing you didnt just watch the series vs okc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wouldnt call dumb pretty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a flagrant is an automatic ejection
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,making sure that peanut butter is extra spreaded
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh right everyone does this its acceptable now that i know this haha carry on then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really its shocking green is getting so much attention for this your average nba player kicks around three faces and four dicks per game if anything he needs to step it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is world cup levels of foul and act hurt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys i think this one is sarcasm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know why your downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair draymond should have gotten a point for that adams throw that was a clean takedown if only he had went for the pin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one reason i want them to lose is because im sick of hearing nothing but gsw and steph curry dickriding from almost every sports fb pagetwitterlocal rec centre bandwagons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant agree with this logic the nba put in place a zone where points would matter more so why would you be upset if a team takes full advantage of it just because they arent driving the ball down the paint for two points and trying to get a foul for that potential third doesnt mean theyre not as skilled or competitive i think its needed to have the warriors change the way the game is played because i want to see different strategies and the game evolve
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i live in syracuse and were all we had going for us so im perfectly happy with it now after that top finish lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea but vikings fans have plenty more than one reason to hate the packers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when has adams ever been dirty ive seen that mf take the most bullshit fouls every game and never so much as complain im not super well versed in the thunder so i might have missed it but from what ive seen adams gets fouled hard allllll the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,try turning it sideways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure and thats a foul but green then proceeded to practice his fucking judo flip and damn near ripped adamss arm out of its socket thats a flagrant im a casual basketball fan and knew next to nothing of greens antics before this series and hes already shown the kind of player he is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what kinda mental gymnastics did you do to convince yourself green wasnt at fault for that watch it again he wraps his arm around adams and takes him to the ground its not adams fault he too is effected by gravity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but green yanked him down thats a reckless and dangerous play
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he did not get ejectedshouldnt he have gotten suspended instead of having the foul be upgraded to a flagrant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone does it the warriors just have better shooter s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,draymond does lead the league in dkpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well somebody had to take bruce bowens place as head goon after he retired
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt say the majority of players hit people in the balls i said the majority of them commit fouls and then cry to the refs as if they didnt do anything please rnba stop leaking lets not pretend he is the only dirty player in the league now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nahhh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as opposed to the dickriding lebron will get if they win face it no matter what team wins we all lose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one reason i want them to lose is because im a cavs and rest of cleveland fan and damn it i want a championship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well you werent there when lebron was on the heat huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just because they arent driving the ball down the paint for two points and trying to get a foul for that potential third doesnt mean theyre not as skilled or competitive thats exactly what they do when they arent shooting its either you drive and go for an because thats the highest potential points highest percentage shot you cant touch someone when theyre driving anymore or you go for the open which the warriors are tailor made to make it doesnt matter if you give up offensive rebounds and points on the other end if youre scoring every time on this one if you like that thats cool but i dont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,watching the steph curry and klay thompson show just isnt fun though like oh cool made another three and another and another thats all they do and theyre destroying the entire league because no one knows how to stop them i dont enjoy watching two players have a shoot around all damn game when the other team is putting in fucking work and still ends up getting smacked because gsw are making more points per made shot yeah theyre really good theres no denying that but if this is what the league is moving towards im gonna start watching games even less than i already do arent enjoyable to see when their are attempted per game edit i obviously have a different opinion than all of you but the gsw are a boring ass team to watch to me if you have a different opinion cool but dont be a fuckig anal bead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but theyll all equally silly in the grand scheme of things
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,adams just plays hard and physical all the time theres a video somewhere on mobile right now of his first couple of seasons in the league getting the shit fouled out of him by respectable nba vets just because they didnt like this young guy coming in and immediately playing tough with them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you brilliant son of a bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i was kind of making a joke in that only after the game did his foul get upgraded so that he should have been ejected rather than being ejected on the spot and yeah he probably should have been suspended but he has that superpower defense against suspension
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,donkey kong penis gropes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looking at his other comments no i guess he isnt whoops
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is one of the most emo threads ive seen about ball
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lebron is an all around better player tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was i think this is worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but twos though now thats exciting edit also theyre destroying the league because they can put a ball through a net better than every other team what is basketball coming to these days i remember back in the good days when basketball was decided by who could run fastest instead of putting the ball through the net better than other teams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is watching a game full of free throw attempts any more fun to watch a game that is sometimes controversially extended
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh ok yeah i knew he was a physical dude but i didnt think he was dirty ya know i feel like hes one of the only guys that has thay level of physical presence without being a cheap fuck but yeah i remember his first few years he got targeted haaaaard always loved that he never so much as blinked though hes a tough motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes the real mvp
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre thinking of reggie evans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dick kicks per game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when its an election season the quality of the election affects the mood of the whole country
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea i didnt know people were this emotionally invested in basketball that being said i gotta root for the warriors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol fuck off sorry i like to see physical play over jump shots fuck me for having a different opinion edit lesson learned dont talk bad about gsw on bpt because youre all gsw dick riders got it i never said they werent really fucking good i said they were boring to watch you band wagoners are so damn quick to get butt hurt over someone saying anything bad about your beloved steph curry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is one of my main gripes with basketball today when it boils down to ridiculous foul calls to extend the game with players who are terrible at free throws its by far the worst aspect of the game it takes away the team aspect of it only to send one player to the line for an interrupted shot makes sense for a proper foul but the last two minutes of a game can take half an hour to pan out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah adams definitely has my respect as a short dude trying to play ball i always loved playing tough and physical but never tried to get dirty guys like udonis haslem had the kind of style i wanted to play when i was younger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as someone from miami i miss this so much fuck lebron though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah im just down voting you cause you seem like a turd i dont even watch the nba just this one comment though not like it matters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you obviously dont watch golden state they shoot a lot of threes but they move the ball well can get inside and score and play physical they cant just jack up threes and win part of the threat is that if you just throw people on them outside they will move the ball or get around you and drive with steph or iggy or catch you on a mismatch when a bigger guy comes out and dray can do work also all the people who want cavs to win because shooting threes is boring obviously did not watch the cavs this playoffs the team that broke the record for threes in a single game and series you can still win with physical play you just have to be able to defend outside on steph watch the team with the second best record this year san antonio they play great d outside and create physical matchups the league isnt moving towards a certain style of play where all a team does is shoot threes there just happens to be the best ever and a top guy at it on the same team
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya fuck the guy that won you two championships
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me why my nigga carmelo lookin ecstatic as he gets dunked on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had sex with a married woman once i did not know she was married until after it did not feel like a win

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol am i missing something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ever since the kg incident every year old mentions lala when the name carmelo comes up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idek wtf that is so i definitely didnt mention lala because of that lol just saying based on the smile in that picture it looks like he enjoys seeing his girl whoever that may be get fucked by another guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont worry bout him neither yea ok

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not them being killed by whites its them being killed by the police an institution whose purpose is to serve and protect the citizens and not to identify them as enemies just by the color of their skin and target them in an overwhelmingly large number for that single reason the statistics that makes sense is this if you have it would be of whites killed by cops vs of blacks killed by cops and if we really wanna be dicks about it how about we even go further and have it prorated to the relative weight of each group pertaining to the full us population

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one time i went to the club on a tab of acid and i wasnt feeling it that much so i decided to take like three more of my tabs and woah man was that not that great of an idea they ended up hitting all at once while i was dancing and luckily there were a bunch of glovers here and they gave me lightshows for days it was great
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i made a similar mistake i quit weed for a couple of years too but was bored because i had break and wanted to experience getting high again to see if it really was how i remembered it man oh man i dont know the specifics of the edible but i had a panic attack near threw up i thought i was dreaming it was like taking super meth when all i needed was tylenol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,made some strong muffins one time after going through a brutal point in my life never made it before but since i love to bake and cook i winged it made the butter using like of vaped leftovers make giant bananacranberrypecan muffins which were so lightweight and fluffy i ate a of one and didnt feel shit this is where i fucked up i ate a whole one plus the other after waiting about minutes lets just say minutes later my eyes were red af i felt like i wasnt even walking but drifting and i ended up reorganizing my room and random shit even did a thorough retwisting of my dreads 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats sounds actually lit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no offensive but are you borderline retarded though like i get taking another tab but why would you just decide to quadruple the dose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clubbing on low doses of acid is pretty popular and fun dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was a raveedm club if that makes things different for you or maybe we just do different things with our time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so with my experience on acid i thought it was a very low doseold batch and i thought it would be safe to take three more because i had the tabs for a while before i took them it wasnt like i bought them that night no im not borderline retarded i just made a bad judgement one night but thanks i guess 🙃
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the c is as silent as yes twitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the phoneme for sc makes the s sound
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game trash

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this post is confusing the way hes laughing seems like hes mocking the text for being inaccurate or ridiculous but apparently thats just him agreeingcelebrating it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can i just say that the fact that friday didnt win an oscar is the biggest fucking sham ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mahershala

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude does a superb job in the house of cards as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but that beach scene thoughwhen her wiped the jizz off in the sand
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now if they could only not make them drug dealers or gangsters wed be set
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this what we are calling these right now black films
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,black excellence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you think the oscars are anything more than a platform that tries to be ahead of the political curve youre sorely mistaken it hasnt been a legitimate appreciation of the arts in over years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey negros are you happy now is this a sufficient bribe can you pretty please stop screaming about how were racists hollywood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just a gay thug with a drug addict mom times are a changing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it had crack tho solid black movie fodder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what even is a black movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,movie had a good meaning but faaaack was it lackluster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean it is a good fucking film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,star wars

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uhhhh have ya seen moonlight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no dude i think she made those fallout games tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,world star is losing their shit claiming how white people are pushing the gay agenda on black people with this movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,movie was straight until the two dude jerked each other off see what i did there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imma be honest take my black card away and inches from my dick but blacklight shouldnt have won
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf movie are you people talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its coming up milhouse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,muslim too and didnt have to play a terrorist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damned true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn refreshing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but was a punk right im ready for the gallows lights cigarette
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only won because the awards were trying to show themselves as not prejudice lets give the award to a film with gay black men not because of the film quality
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that shit was a handmedown because of last year oscar so white the movie itself was obvious oscar bait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont see color i see people but forreal shouts to them someone let barack know we got a new barry in town barrrryyyyyy jenkinnnsssssss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just gays
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,think anybody can get me this gif by itself would be much appreciated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it feels pretty much like forced affirmative action because of all the white oscars posts last year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the documentaries definitely made up for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now i must see this movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oscarssoblack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,next task is to just recognize it as a movie not a black movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they still tried to give it to white folk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gayness tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a movie that has a black guy playing a gay role there werent any movies that got nominated that has a black guy who just plays a regular guy in a movie its always something wrong with them and those are the movies that get nominated and possibly win awardsam i the only one who sees this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they psyched out the whitest movie over the year la la land and instead gave it to moonlight cant stop laughing at that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea but yall had to do gay for pay to get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats most likely what tipped the scale in its win against the other films soooo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly saw the win and assumed it was something to do with a black power theme i have not seen anything about the movie now that i know its not i may actually check it out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what do you mean la la land won
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but they literally used the same kind of victimization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,la la land just took home tonight edit idc im being downvoted it still happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just showed the world that black gangsters are gay that is all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they kinda had to with all the whining last year who picks the winners yeah its rigged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you imagine if it was the other way around there would be riots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey look your complaining may have actually worked lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now just get rid of any sjw content such as gay lovemaking and you have my applause
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah there was drug dealers and crackheads he hit the help and years a slave categories but missed the precious category
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but it wasnt about drug dealers moonlight was rewarded for doing what art must portray the complex reality of being human in the past that hasnt been enough to win a film about black americans an oscar generally the characters also had to directly symbolize the struggle against oppression
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but nice ones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but so did manchester by the sea and that was whiter than mahershalas smile
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and gay people thats a sure fire recipe to win an oscar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont call him cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my names not cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he was absolutely my favorite part of luke cage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mind you his name is remy danton or juan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre the top comment so im piggy backing off of you theres not a single mention of the name of the film in this entire thread
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes fantastic in house of cards as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy crap i watched the years ago and i didnt realize it was the same guy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mahershala ali is a fucking beast he was burning the candle on both ends doing house of cards and luke cage at the same time hes earned every single bit of the recognition and then some i cant wait to see whats next for him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,once i saw him on the red carpet i was pumped i recognized richard immediately and his worriedpitiful way of saying lily
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was super hyped when i saw him in luke cage i loved the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the plot holes were just too obvious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they have nothing to lose but their chains
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt the whole point of collective bargaining that you can get a better deal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,film union workers are well taken care of
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im guessing youve never been in a union and have no experience with unions or labor laws
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf they probably get a way better deal than nonunion workers thats like the whole point of a union
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tell me more where do i find these
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,slavery and union workers lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im gonna go cry over someone getting shift mandatory for a few minutes of actual labor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well thats a given since the movie won an oscar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,praise be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish i could dance like that with confidence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrist wrist wrist wrist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,post on rblackpeoplegifs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its it just my or does this gif look like the tint has been turned down on everything except objects
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why cant i click this link on the reddit ios app its happened a few times where you have to click it in just the right position for it to open the reddit app blows
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god is trademark idk why that made me laugh so hard
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,great song reference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at god i dont get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not vocal minority
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah shouldnt it be the opposite
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he dies the mother mentions a funeral and the bully mentions juan not being around anymore so you can put together that hes the one who died
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,s i think he died i didnt catch it either and i watched it twice but thats what most people says
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first muslim in general
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,emma stone isnt muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and i believe he played college basketball at saint marys so a first for athletes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had no idea he was muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mama met mahershala and gave me his number
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and he from oakland
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my roommate said it was really good at first and then dudes started jerking each other off so her turned it off prob one of those watch it twice type of movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hopefully more people will now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it seems like no one heard about it from advertising just from word of mouth it was popular in my friend group but mostly because we have a really good independent theater in town i hope a lot more people watch it now it was so beautiful genuine and tender
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did but honestly didnt love it im not a big fan of movies spanning decades and using multiple actors for one character like you have to at that point makes it more difficult to connect with the character for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive seen it pre release in germany i thought it was quite boring to be honest but that is just my opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its this thing where if a movie has more than people of a certain race in lead roles it becomes movie you should watch master of none on netflix they have a really great episode on the subject
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,written directed and starred by black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly im not looking at manchester by the sea and calling it a white film like come on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the confusion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a movie made by tyler perry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the help
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jump to but actually whole video is pretty great edit wrong video sorry watch this nichelle nichols was first black women portraid as not a maid on screen till that time it was kinda fucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also gone with the windhattie mcdaniel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,real talk lol this some all lives matter shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the prosecution would like to show the posts about leonardo dicaprio winning his first oscar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did no one like arrival i thought it deserved to win but definitely knew it wasnt going to over moonlight or la la land
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was a meh year for the oscars nothing i thought i was spectacular
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everything isnt about race but when a movie is made by black people about black characters race is probably going to come up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,be an activist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was lion about that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,crash is not a black film its about race relations in la yes but not strictly between blacks and it was written directed and produced by a white man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am since im still salty it won over brokeback mountain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what would a movie about people getting turned on by car crashes have to do with race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aside from not being a black film crash is also garbage most cartoonish movie about race ever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we try to as much as possible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that movie sucks b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont know about that but at least it had an asian in a leading role
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the real reason it won was because it was a masterfully crafted film that was incredible i personally believe la la land should have won but this really doesnt have much to do with politics compared to how skillfully made this film was if the oscar voters only cared about seeming politically correct they would have voted for hidden figures which is also a black film with political themes that is was more popular and successful and had a much higher budget
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i really dont care what agenda people seem to think this movie represents people act like the oscars are some goddamned mccarthyan conspiracy and hollywood is full of commies the movie at most was about a man who comes of age in an alltoofamiliar environment that can exist for impoverished gay black youth who are effectively some of the most marginalized people in this country all of the themes of poverty isolation abandonment and abuse play in the background to this mans maturation and growth throughout the film we arent supposed to cry for chiron because he is gay or black or abused by a crackhead mom the film doesnt pander for sympathy like he is some kind of precious existing in a vacuum we are supposed to understand why it is he became what he became under those circumstances and hopefully understand and apply these things to life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what was your least favorite scene of the movie i ask tongue in cheek because i know you didnt watch it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no thread is safe from spoilers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i hadnt even heard of it and had only heard one mention of la la land in passing dont know anybody that has seen or wants to see either of them arrival was sick and is my personal best picture i kinda hate oscar bait movies i made the mistake of seeing the constant gardener waaaay back when it was up for an oscar and it bored me to fucking tears only movie ive ever walked out of and ive seen some shit movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk ask the white people who cant relate to an ensemble black cast for some reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,moonlight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why are you pretending that black people came up with this categorization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a movie of just regular guys would be a terrible movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,any actoractress characters are usually flawed or have some type of internal conflict that is what brings the drama out in a role so i see what youre getting at but i dont think black actors winning for roles like that is negative or derogatory anthony hopkins won an oscar for being a people eating serial killer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre referring to another actor i apologize but mahershala didnt play a gay character
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought the black muslim was the guy who won best supporting actor whos name i cant spell he wasnt gay in the movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this shit better be a joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and you fuck dogs for nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats not true at all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and oscars bro dont make lalaland the bad guy because it has white actors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why the fuck does it matter do you actually care that much about the characters sexuality fucking hell its just a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cant agree more i was watching it and thinking this is a decent flick then they started kissing turned it off immediately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,art can be inhumane art is about the expression of idea not just humanity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not just nice but ones who were multifaceted characters juan genuinely saw parts of himself in little as someone who grew up isolated and struggled to find himself the desire to help little and act as a father figure clashed mightily with how his work impacted littles mother and in turn little
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,waste of fucking potential
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same usually i despise the antagonist but he was so captivating i love him in luke cage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill always remember him as richard tyler in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,moonlight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is he cottonmouth in luke cage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,such a great actor i was rewatching moonlight last night after the epic win and the way he carries himself as juan is amazing when you compare his role in the government in house of cards hope to see him in more stuff soon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do you remember something you watched years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this thread gets locked and shipped to the colonies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,comrades❤
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a common complaint of the proletariat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck bpt is woke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mmmmmm mmhmm mmmm hmmm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the one time loose can be misused as lose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre actually responding to a politicized antiunion comment lets take a look at the actual terms before we decide that the unions have failed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seriously film unions are ridiculous in ensuring their members are paid very well and taken care of try being nonunion on a film set youre treated as replaceable and constantly reminded of it you get paid and left in the sun and cold while the union workers get fed great food and moved into the shade
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who needs real life experience when you have internet articles and fox news
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpwwwiatsenet theyre actually not terrible source am an iatse member edit use their directory to go to local chapter sites the contracts vary by region but a lot of locals will have copies of the agreements available
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao few minutes our work days are minimum
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tyler perry was fantastic in gone girl im also biased because anytime a character has my name its awesome
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not confidence its the holy spirit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude pulled his daughter out the way of brother franklin afraid that his mesmerizing moves may lead her down the path of sinor that she might get kicked with a stanky leg if she dont pay attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never had to flip a brick but i get the jist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,had the same problem and gave up on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the bully with the dreads mentioned it too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah he did chiron and and theresa talk about it in part
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,first muslim actor a muslim directir has won twice or more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no first actor iranian directors have won oscars before iran hashas had a very interesting film culture develop since the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she is black though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do the actors get credit for best song or just the writer because esther williams performance of baby its cold outside won best song in williams won three national aau swimming championships in the
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the first name wasnt enough of a give away huh edit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i saw it at a little arthouse cinema in a city hours away from where i live because it wasnt playing in my town i preordered it on amazon and chose release day delivery
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn aint this the truth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was that the point of the movie at all ive only seen trailers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i imagine half of the people boasting about this black film winning the best picture award did the same thing your roommate did homophobia is still rampant in the culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,should have turned her on but thats a spoiler js
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my roommate said it was really good at first and then dudes started jerking each other off so her turned it off thats a friendship test for my future use there if you cant watch something gay in a movie without turning it off because of that then you shouldnt be my friend because its not like it was a gay porno its literally just meant to show an emotional connection its not like it was meant to turn people on it was the same reason any straight characters have sex in a film to establish a relationship itd be one thing if it was because it was awkwardly done or something but if he literally just turned it off because it was gayfuck that man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from the commercial i was like oh this is a hood coming of age movie put the movie on and watching it with the wife and her friend who happens to be a black lesbian and she knows what its about and gives me a side eye im guessing she knew about it from a newsletter they get monthly but she doesnt hint at what its about im watching it trying to pretend im completely relaxed but its way more intimate of a movie than i expected nothing hardcore but i can imagine dudes in general not being able to watch it or they do and move to atlanta
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know its literally the highest rated show on netflix but this is such a good show if anyone reading this has not watched it you should
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,master of none is the best american show in regards to having a well rounded believable and diverse cast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id definitely classify this as new black cinema though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i usually just call that a film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i loved manchester by the sea but that film was pretty white man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well white is considered the standard in america just like fahrenheit is the standard for temperature if i said its degrees you would assume its in fahrenheit so calling a movie black is just letting ya know its about black characters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now im sad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think denzel shouldve gotten that one seeing as he has already played in that role
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what about hell or high water movie was fucking amazing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,check out hacksaw ridge if you havent seen it yet it starts off slow but the payoff is good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i liked manchester by the sea but its a movie for me not an or neither is la la land i liked spotlight from a year or ago a lot more than any of these
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you see fences denzel amp viola were fucking incredible their acting and the script made a hour movie where almost nothing happens way more interesting than youd expect casey affleck was as emotionally interesting as a white no pun intended wall compared to denzel imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i really agree i loved moonlight and was glad it won but even that was a wee thing n the boring side jackie was blah loving was blah la la land was fine arrival was fine manchester was blah nocturnal was ok it was not a good year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and ironically won against what shouldve been a shooin for best picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought the same fucking thing until i moved to la years ago ive experienced and witnessed racism before but not on a level like it is in la first time i watched the movie i thought the racism was over the top turns out they underplayed it in the movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,crash is the of race relations movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no fuckin way i thought la la land was all style no substance and moonlight was just a tour de force telling of a story i dont see represented enough i dont think an agenda was being pushed since its just a story based on the creators actual life and experiences i called moonlight for best picture as soon as i saw it last one i watched out of all the other nominees and was glad to be proven right eventually
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually i saw the movie opening weekend i see most movies that have high ratings it was a good movie and im not taking away from that only scene i personally didnt care for was the beach scene with him and kevin but since it did drive the plot it really didnt take away from the movie and was kinda essential to the story and before everyone claims homophobic i dont care for sexual scenes in any movie unless it is essential to the plot and at least somewhat tastefully done when it comes down to the best movie i really dont think this was it la la land hacksaw ridge and fences were better movies in my opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my bad my bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hadnt even heard of it the oscars is a vote by people in the industry who also presumably have seen all the nominated movies your oscar bait claims arent valid until you can provide a universal criteria to judge movies by and then you need to prove that the winning movie does not fit those criteria as well as arrival best movie isnt always most entertaining just because you didnt like a movie doesnt mean shit im going to trust a democratic process of experienced voters over listening to the average redditor thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol not the point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can see what your saying ill be convinced when i see a movie like i mentioned above
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah youre right juan won
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,naw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know damn well youd rather have had hidden figures or fences win that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not saying they were bad but that whole mess was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont but clearly they do and movies write history for the majority of people its not just a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its fine but i want to see a black movie win without anything that gets the easy votes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i prefer the novelization of precious based on the book push by sapphire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that sounds like a fanfiction collab
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well by definition you need humans for something to be inhumane before there were humans i think it was classified as nature im pretty comfortable defending the position that all art is about us on some level actually let me sharpen it a little all human artwork is about humans it is made by them and for them so it cannot be otherwise the subject doesnt have to be human but in the end the artwork is about humans relationship to that subject
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god i love this fucking movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,such a great character and the back story episode was fantastic then the show took a shit and i still havent finished it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,incoming controversial opinion cottonmouths potential was reached right before he was written out of the show he was graciously saved from the marvel netflix curse that wouldve ruined his character by dragging out his conflict with luke cage for the rest of the season
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i agree but what happened next really improved mariah as a character and a villain i enjoyed the rest of the show but not near as much i was calling it my favorite marvel show until i got to the back half
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his name is mr stokes 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my name is not cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i havent seen moonlight yet so i only know him as the adoptive father in benjamin button and the man who eventually marries katherine in hidden figures in both movies hes married to taraji p henson
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it gets pretty meh after season honestly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in colonization
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,screenshot this and post to rfullcommunism with some catchy title about class conciousness and youll get some nice karma probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,comrade 😘😘😘😘👅👅👅👅
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha thats what i figured if unions were so terrible for the workers we wouldnt have fought so frickin hard to have them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly why do people upvote this drivel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right his acting in gg felt so natural i have no idea why people hate him though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not roasting his acting chops this is more of a jab at him as a film maker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wasnt too shabby in ninja turtles either and thats not even a joke the michael bay ones get a bad wrap but the second one was a really fun movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the most unrealistic part of that movie was a black guy named tanner imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,error confidence not found
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its easy get confidence drunk dance like that ftfy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist wrist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always thought it was gist huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i read yesterday that this was the first ever muslim oscar period edit it was the first actor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and hawaiian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is called mahershalalhashbaz ali but that isnt his birth name it is the name took when he converted to islam he was born mahershalalhashbaz gilmore seriously
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im born and raised muslim and i had never even heard the name mahershala before him sounded more biblical to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mahershala is hebrew its isaiahs second sons name iirc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,haha he actually talked about that on npr its a jewish name actually that his mother gave him when he was born and he didnt become a muslim till he was an adult on new years eve of i know something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his name aint muslim and he wasnt born muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he wasnt raised muslim though i think he was raised as some sort of christian then converted later in life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im amazed you got all these upvotes from this ridiculously ignorant comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it actually is a christian name his mother gave him he talks about their relationship in his i very much recommend it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deleted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know a shit ton of kids with muslim names but it was only cause their parents were looking into the noi but then decided it was dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so if you dont enthusiastically watch guys jerk each other off youre homophobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,master of none really i thought it was really awkward and acting was pretty bad i still liked it but highest rated show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thank you gonna go peep now edit its lit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scrubs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but taking all the meaningless stuff out it is still wooden awkward and sometimes downright unfunny
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah guys all films matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that movie basically just screams lrish catholics ova here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey now they had a ginger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that movie was white as fuck lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like im obligated to watch any movie set in the greater boston area glad to hear its actually good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the worst thing is he lost while swinging for the fences no but seriously i saw that clip during the show and i cant stop thinking about ityou cant see the tears in his eyes in this gif
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,silence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it draws obvious comparisons to no country for old men which did win a best picture comparing the two no country was clearly a much better movie in my opinion the acting was better the cinematography and the writing were more professional and the themes were more mature next to it hohw looks hamfisted and amateurish though it was still a good movie and i enjoyed it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so i saw something really interesting in moonlight perhaps pointing it out can increase your interest in the movie i took a writing course in college and the subject of writing black characters came up i think maya angelou said some controversial thing about whites not being able to write black characters but anyway the discussion went something like this novice white writers will write black characters as walking stereotypes and thats kinda racist then the next step up in quality which is most common is that they write black characters as white people who happen to have black skin and thats pretty acceptable but it also feels a little inauthentic to the reader great writers will write black characters which feel like they grew up with the cultural baggage of being black in america for many years i was very skeptical of these claims but moonlight hit the nail on the head and im really starting to see what maya angelou was saying all of those characters felt incredibly authentic growing up x in america leaves its mark everyone even if they love books or playing baseball grows up in the context of a culture and that culture be a part of that character unless you have experienced that yourself its incredibly difficult to add that as an ingredient to your characters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is hilarious im not a white woman but i could relate to la la land can you seriously not relate to anything thats not about another white person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least casey didnt win but he did tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,casey did win for best actor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its august wilsons script originally he wrote the play one of americas best playwrights for a reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ever been depressed casey affleck played the best depressed character i have ever seen but the movie isnt going to be everyones cup of tea the ending pissed off a few people i watched it with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont look at me i liked brokeback mountain
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when people talk about crash i always think of the crash and start talking about it after a few sentence and moments of confusion on their faces i say oh you are talking about the horrible movie of the same name i have very few friends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh thank you for saying this i told my friends how terrible this movie was and they looked at me like i just kicked a puppy its awful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh my god thank you i think that is one of the worst picks for best picture in my lifetime
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably the worst best picture winner ever i dont know the broadway melody cimarron and cavalcade are all pretty atrocious and around the same time you had films like sunrise and all quiet on the western front winning in between both of which are among the greatest films of their respective decades
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that car crash scene was really good though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,la la big city of dreams everything in la aint always what it seems you gots to hit up nyc to feel no racial tension b
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sidney pottier won an oscar and from what i remember he played more or less an everyman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its okay that you got it wrong it takes one juan to know juan won
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hidden figures was a popcorn drama and fences had some fantastic performances and the script was great but it wasnt adapted to film that well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what exactly is wrong about a movie about gay people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah i saw it with a friend so thats at least two
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,enough with this whole worst year ever bs it was bad because we let it get that way not enough people voted for hillary but still complained when trump won not enough people voted against brexit but complained when it passed harambe being killed was tragic but it turned into a meme not a tragedy about an endangered species being killed because of bad parenting finally the unnaturally high celebrity deaths were tragic and are honestly the only one i can see to why was a bad year sorry been holding that in for a minute
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i prefer the japanese manga pusho by sapphire based on the novelization of precious based on the book push by sapphire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know right it was an alltime favorite as soon i left the theater
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,spoiler not worth finishing the season read a summary if you want butdiamondback was a joke compared to cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my wife and i watched it all last weekend and loved it except the last episode which was the most boring finale ive ever seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same i think i liked him too much so when he was gone i was likeeh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sweet christmas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we have a winner
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do yourself a favor and watch it now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes such a good actor up until a week ago i thought the only thing id seen him in was moonlight and id seen luke cage and hocs im shocked about that benjamin button thing he looks older in that than he does now heh also he is so goooood in moonlight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes one of those actors that has been quietly stealing the show in everything hes been in for the last decade or so mahershala is finally getting his due
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,couple goals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more like halfway through season tbh that hacker plot line was the worst
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my favorite characters out of a ton of shows remy danton is a g too tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in transportation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,colonize motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in miscegenation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in taxation without representation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would but i got banned
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,becuase of madea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i couldnt agree more i personally thought he deserved a best supporting acting nom for that year i usually shit on his movies but he was flat out awesome in gg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,any time i see gg i think gossip girl the tv show on the cw about rich and spoiled high schoolers freaked out for a moment to learn that he was involved in that one then i remembered we we talking about gone girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fair enough i dont know how the madea movies keep making money my friend put on a madea movie i fell asleep in the middle of one and then woke up in the middle of a different madea movie but i didnt know it was a different film so they dont seem to be all that different i dont know why does madea exist im taking a nap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had fun with those movies theyre bad but i really like when the turtles are on screen the turtles are great honestly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well thats technically liquid confidence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit its true mahershalalhashbaz mahershala ali pronunciation məˈhɜːrʃələ born mahershalalhashbaz gilmore february is an american actor httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimahershalaali
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre right he was on npr last week and said his mother told him it was hebrew he wasnt born muslim but converted a few years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its definitely biblical its from isaiah and means something like quick to the spoils or quick to the plunder one of the hamfisted prophetic names in isaiah i was surprised when i found out he was muslim but i wasnt surprised when i found out he converted not really a name a born muslim gets
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,his full name is actually mahershalalhashbaz cant say ive ever heard that one before
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends which bible i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ooo get pooped on umglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mahershalalhashbaz was the second son of the prophet isaiah so its more of a jewish christian name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the people in isaiah named their kids with the most hamfisted and obvious names possible every name means something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit the guy has a jewish name initially raised christian before converting to islam this guys got it all
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i heard that interview too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ali aint muslim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my name aint cottonmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta ride the mods dick i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,especially from the mod who is the most outspoken about racism lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i imagine that gay people tolerate straight sex scenes in movies even if they find it offputting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they didnt show anything and it lasted like seconds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im assuming you wouldnt turn off the titanic during the nude art scene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a film about sexuality and does a really good job of not showing any sex gratuitously there is a single scene roughly a couple minutes long where a guy gets jerked off and thats it for the entire movie compared to how liberally heterosexuality is portrayed in mainstream culture it is very tasteful if you cant stand the movie based on that scene then you are beyond being reached
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you cant sit through less than minutes of it without shutting the movie off and refusing to finish it then kinda yeah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a difference between enthusiastically watching and tolerating something for the sake of appreciating a movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i get what you mean some performances felt kinda wooden but damn if i didnt love that show cant wait for season
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stranger things mad men and probably others that i am forgetting are definitely rated higher and are better shows imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree i loved parks and aziz in that but master of none sucked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,weirdly enough thats what i enjoyed the show felt very real every situation felt relatable it was the perfect amount of awkward like the office sometimes can do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i really like it and have watched it through a few times now its fantastically written and each episode has great plot but fuck me denise and brian are awful actors in it aziz says so many lines as if hes in the middle of a standup routine on rotten tomatoes i feel like the merit given for its diversity and episodic themes is just eclipsing other important factors still looking forward to season
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nvm i take it back edit why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that movie basically just screams fucking lrish catholics ova here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but no one really calls it an irish catholic movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imo should have been best picture super heart wrenching and so good i liked moonlight and thought either it or lala would win but personally manchester is my best movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this film shook me so hard man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ben foster was amazing how can you call his performance mediocre
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah well thats just like your opinion man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep agreed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,brokeback mountain was miles away from crash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the movie nerd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck new york seriously overrated i used to live on and qb i fucking hated new york
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sidney pottier thats awesome damn that was a while ago hopefully more movies would follow suit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its just my theory but i think that the high amount of celebrity deaths is more akin to the fact that theres way more famous people than ever before many of them werent of old age but compared to who was considered a celebrity years ago its just statistically likely we will see more of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck hillary clinton
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean shit it was still the worst year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just a joke bruh but i hear ya
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its so good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill agree with you on that season was so damn good what happened
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in forced immigration
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it safe to assume you were being a reactionary kulak
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rcompleteanarchy is like fullcom but without the stupid tankie bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he makes those movies for the oldmiddle aged black women demographic but everyone acts like he drops them as moty candidates and get riled up the hate is unreal tho and lowkey racist theyre movies for the old traditional black people filled with relatable maybe very exaggerated tropes im not gonna go watch sex in the city and then complain about how white it is the only argument i usually agree with is that most of his madea plays are pretty much the same plot the movies are varied a bit but still the same generally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i loved the first one but the whole time i was like okay i can see why people hate on this but im easily amused and love it then the second one was just plain fun
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep i went back and found the article and it said actor my bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how the motherfuck do i pronounce a an upside e and this ʃ thing im pretty sure i saw in algebra
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikimahershalaali helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a bloody obscure reference i think its one of isaiahas sons one that got a random name because it was part of a prophecy its so obscure it doesnt even sound hebrew
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck heard that too wrote a whole comment thinking i was smart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was the conversion before or after the first time he won in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hamfisted no such thing in judaism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not even all of it its actually mahershalalhashbaz then check this joint pelejoezelgibborabiadsarshalom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but can he see why kids love the taste of cinnamon toast crunch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its almost like he is abrahamic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he converted some years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is a mod actually i think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well to be fair once people are done jerking off to porn they are repulsed by it same thing here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you cant sit through less than minutes of a horse fucking a woman in the ass then you hate animals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really being repulsed by homosexual acts does not necessarily have anything to do with ones opinion on equality were getting to the point where when youre not actively jerking off to gay porn someone will call you homophobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i see what youre saying but youre conflating finding the sexual acts gross with disliking the people who commit them being disgusted by sexual activity of people youre not attracted to is completely normal sex can be pretty gross unless youre attracted to the person youre doing it with or watching do it to a straight male two ugly women fucking can be gross just as watching two guys fuckbecause that straight male isnt attracted to either set of people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all questions are valid questions the question they asked has an obvious answer does that make you homophobic if a thirty second nonhardcore gay scene is so upsetting to you that you have to turn the film off then yes its likely youre at least mildly homophobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the asian guy was pretty bad i forgot his name because i watched it so long ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but they kinda did call it a boston movie which is in the eyes of the rest of america basically the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not sure that ultimately any film is trying to get the audience to relate to the characters on anything other than an emotional level i feel like part of the point of movies is the idea that even if you have zero in common with the person on screen you feel what they feel because feeling is the thing that connects us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but it came out in ha edit i just watched the trailer and hahah wtf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,growing up in that area mustve been rough that whole zone has now become the new yuppie go to spot did you only live there what about nyc did you hate so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,moonlight was basically brokeback mountain meets precious shout out to you for seeing through the bs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup its going to be the new normal its life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shes better than trump and dont you dare fucking argue
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea but dont act like we were just helpless and just kept dumping on us it happened because people werent doing their part
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah dont where the hate la la land because white people thing came from besides geting like oscar but not the big one is pretty much the movie equivalent of blowing a lead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the show became too much about frank and not enough about the other characters
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in plantation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its been a while but from what i remember i had used a word that was considered ableist i dont even know what word was considered ableist or what ableism was when i got banned that and for a brief time i was a trump supporter you can see it in my post history if you look far enough theres a short list of stuff we agree on and i like talking about politics with people who have different viewpoints i have had a couple good conversations with trump supporters and socialistscommunists on this site
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the council votes yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,way more chill also
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not just white people hate but also alot of black people hate it too i cant explain why but almost every madea movie rubs me the wrong way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think hes becoming selfaware now which is amazing as cheesy as boo the madea halloween movie was i honestly enjoyed it better than all the other madea films and ive seen most of them growing up being around my mom and grandmother who watch that type of shit boo was definitely made for a different audience one that is agreeable with me and everyone else who loves to watch bad films and laugh while having a few drinks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the thing is as you said his plot lines and often the portrayal of the characters are so exaggerated but most people just say so relatable and dont acknowledge that so it becomes annoying like really you think people like this exist come on also and i think this is more a problem with show business than with tyler he always uses the same actors over and over again i guess there are only so many black faces in hollywood but i just saw these two get married and have children together now in another movie the same two people are brother and sister and their aunt from the first one is now just the neighbor it makes binge watching so cringey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea ive never understood how someone who cant pronounce a word is supposed to find hieroglyphics helpful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its ipa the long s goes sh the upsidedown e sounds like uh basically and the three sounds like eh mawhairshuhluh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thrashf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,muhhershuhluh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i learned all of these symbols in my high school speech class and promptly forgot them by college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love running into stuff like that like people try to give their kids biblical names all the time but its always the same names like isaac or joshua its also funny when people pull random names out and dont check i ran into a girl a year or two ago whos parents named her bathsheba yikes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better then being named michael i am never going to live up to that and i had in one math class
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uhh tan lines
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh come on it wasnt that graphic there have been straight sex scenes much worse and it didnt make the movie unwatchable for me you can watch a sex scene and have other reactions besides arousal or disgust forget what other are saying and think why you cant continue to watch the movie after that scene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but we watch murders and rapes and even child rape in all kinds of movies shouldnt everyone be repulsed by murder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus you dont have to jerk off to it but that doesnt mean you cant literally watch it not every sex scene is meant to be arousing if you literally cant stand watching two gay guys have sex for a couple minutes simply because it doesnt turn you onget fuck out of here with that shit alright im not turned on by bdsm but i can still enjoy a movie like secretary if its done well i havent seen it yet but you get what i mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your comment is the new im not homophobicracist but
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is such a straw man its unbelievable this movie is a love story between two people if you cant watch a subtly shot scene of them being sexual youre less homophobic than juvenile
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you watch the movie you dont even see anything not even an orgasm face i am am a heterosexual male and seriously would be appalled if people couldnt watch this movie and werent deserving of the homophobic label
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah bill burr has a great bit on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that scene was probably about two and a half minutes of the movie if you cant sit through that for the rest theres a problem there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont particularly like people getting shoot but i dont turn the movie off when that comes up on the screen it is a work of fiction if you cant stomach seeing people doing pretty normal stuff on movies you are in for a bad time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you claim to be for gay rights yet when theyre represented in film you say ew gross stop shoving this shit in my face one or the other you cant be both
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you actually know the definition of homophobic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were getting to the point where when youre not actively jerking off to gay porn someone will call you homophobic lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which is all fine but to say that the rest of the movie is not worth watching because of a single very small and fully clothed gay scene is a level above simply being disgusted by something youre not into im not just talking about disliking the scene im talking about shutting the movie completely off and not watching the rest because of it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she isnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in skin tone segregation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense i actually wasnt allowed into the rfullcommunism discord server because my post history also had some ableist stuff and by wasnt allowed i mean they told me to edit the ableist language out of my posts unsub to some of their nono subs like and try again in a month or so we were all uninformed at some point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cause it pushes that loudmouth acting ignorant and abrasive angryblackperson bullshit stereotype at least thats my reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i might actually watch a madea movie for the first time in years now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the point of phonetics is that the literal spelling can only be sounded out one way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,got to love high school and you get to feel so smart for knowing the most usually useless stuff that you never need to know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is bathsheba a biblical whore or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not religious but i really like some biblical names ive always loved the name judah which isnt really a name in the us unless you convert it to something else like jude bathsheba would be a really unfortunate name though poor girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nobody can live up to jordan 🏀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive got michael and levi in my full name so ya know doubling down on the hebrew text
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know about you but if theres a graphic rape scene in a movie i usually dont end up watching the rest of the movie this isnt commentary on the subject at hand through that being said intimate acts arent really represented the same as violent acts in cinema intimate acts are significantly more taboo than violence in our current culture not to mention homosexual intimacy of which acceptance is a relatively new concept in this era in a perfect world yeah we should be more repulsed by violence but sex is more taboo in the real world its just how it be
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i dont particularly enjoy watching straight people have sex but i dont give a shit if its in a tv show or movie its a thing that happens in life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would it appall you if people didnt want to watch sexual acts thats really weird does it appall you if grandparents dont watch the sex scenes in game of thrones im genuinely curious to your use of the word appall it seems to be really important to you that everyone share your morals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i suspect that the repulsion many guys feel for gay intimacy is a learned behavior
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someone can be for gay rights and not want to see a gay sexlove scene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep that makes sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i enjoyed this internet exchange of thoughts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in gentrification
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait what im subscribed to both and rfullcommunism and ive had no issues i dont really post there though i just marvel at the memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would they want you to unsubscribe from that sub if its just for circlejerking then why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that great they try not to be sectarian but unless youre like a hardcore mlm then theres really not a lot going on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,giving people an excuse to go yes this is exactly what black people are like yes sooo relatable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean i get the concept but who the hell knows those symbols
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she was married to a guy named uriah and she was so hot king david had her husband killed so he could marry her himself not as bad as jezebel but not great either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youve never read the whole story id recommend it its not that long you could probably even find a youtube video of it ive always liked that it shows david a king with a lot of significance in the bible and the guy jesus is ultimately a descendant of as imperfect a little fucked up even interesting stuff in that ther biblay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,judah p benjamin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn steven is my middle name at least my dutch last name is very unique
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i said i would be appalled if they couldnt watch this movie specifically talking about this sex scene if people are antiwatching sex scenes or mutual masturbation of any type then cool if people cant watch this because all of a sudden its two men then yes thats homophobic and your inference about me wanting everyone to share my morals is a biiiiigggg stretch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its fine if you dont want to see it but dont complain about them existing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what in capital accumulation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was only bc asked to join rfullcommunism s discord server they screen that more to keep trolls out you can be subbed to both and as long as you dont use hate speech or something youre fine they seem to be more strict on the discord server bc its more serious and less memey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they just wanted to make sure that i wasnt a altright troll or anything bc im sure they get plenty of ppl just being dicks they never told me i had to unsub from or anything but they brought it up when they went through my comment history or something basically saying we dont really like and dont want a bunch of ppl from there in our server which makes sense and the rfullcommunism discord server isnt as circlejerky as the sub its more for discussion and has a nice setup to learn if youre actually interested in communism so i guess they filter it more to keep trolls out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,phoneticists and people who spend five minutes looking it up you could say the same thing for any written language
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats the deal with jezebel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even worse david had an affair with her and then decided to kill her husband to cover it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so her parents wanted her to be pretty why is that bad or unusual
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a little fucked up even the dude genocided philistines and brought their foreskins back in a bloody sack as an offering to the king id say thats more than a little fucked up lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if people cant watch this because all of a sudden its two men then yes thats homophobic being homophobic is by definition unreasoning fear of or antipathy toward homosexuals and homosexuality by your logic not liking to see a man masturbating himself is also homophobic anyway its the third comment saying the same thing no one is going to change your mind
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know what else is a biiiiggggg stretch making a claim that someone else fears or hates a certain people or group because they choose not to watch movies that show that group engaged in something they dont have interest in i agree with you that some people that choose not to watch homosexual sex scenes might be homophobic whatever and whoever gets to define that term that doesnt mean that all of them are and to classify all of them as such is stereotyping this still leaves my original point undiscussed why the crap are you appalled by someone elses movie viewing habits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait so if people dont want to watch sex scenes or mutual masturbation thats cool with you as long as its not moonlight how does that logic even work inside your head
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but in this case we were talking about the guy just switched it off and moved on he didnt complain he didnt march down the street with a sign saying gays r evil he literally just switched off a movie and went about his life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wheres the gravy at thats why the sex so dry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck dude my mouth feels dry just looking at that shit i need to get some water
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no carrots gravy or mash and only aunt bessies wtf is this shit

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im positive thats cauliflower but if thats mashed potatoes she need to go ahead and just sell all her cooking utensils
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the turkeychicken looks dry too

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i cant make out if the first pic is supposed to be positive or negative cause martin and wills faces are making a kind of ughh look to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive always wondered who in their right mind would want a so like this it sounds like a recipe for disaster in either case shes a girl that is a shut in with no social life or a girl that clings onto your social life because she doesnt have friends of her own that shit sounds like a nightmare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always assumed this meant they never got a chance to talk to her before she never goes out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit just got real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get out fam its a trap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if a chick is hot with no friends it means she probably fucked her friends over badly and now they dont fuck with her or shes wild and no chicks fucked with her in the first place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i wish women felt that way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think there might be some gray space between getting drunk in public and being a hostage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitches are already crazy obsessive with friends and going out you really gonna play yourself by wanting someone who had literally nothing to focus on but you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey what you doing 😋 you ignoring me 🤔🤔 iighht say no more 👌🏾👍🏾👏🏾 honestly youre mad fckin childish like why ask me to be your girlfriend if you cant even reply to my messages i ignore like niggas a day just to talk to you and youre ignoring melike what the fuck youre such a lame ass nigga ✌🏾️ bitchi just came home from working a hour shiftim muhhhfukkin tiyeddd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly thats why i like my girls busy as fuck my girl has multiple jobs and multiple friend groups we pretty much have a set schedule of when we see each other week to week and if we go hours without texting back no one throws a fuss shits beautiful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never understood that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,manlet detected master race

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me too sorry but girls like these have way to many damn problems to the point where shell make a nigga drop everything for her i just lost my best friend recently to this shit thanks to an ultimatum she gave him between me and her ive never been so hurt in my life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bro i just had my girl leave me cus i didnet text her on the daily for days wtf
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my social life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like to go out all the time and my girl is the opposite she hardly even drinks but shes not clingy or shut down or anything like that shes actually mad independent and is just perfectly okay with staying home out of times she lets me do me and she does her ive honestly never been in a more relaxed and comfortable relationship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because dudes run around girls whose best friend is club dick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or she could have anxiety depression be extremely shy or maybe left an abusive relationship or moved somewhere to try to get clean from drugs there are tons of reasons why someone could have no friends still never date someone with no friends because they obviously have bigger problems they need to work on first
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or she doesnt like girls because they are fucked up and play games love drama the mature alley does exist mr black or white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive seen this shit in action i want to believe that there is another way but i havent seen it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtdspopng

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this in a nutshell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like a nice healthy normal relationship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true shit i live with my girl so we honestly dont text each other at all unless its something urgent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is truly what i need and many guys ive been seeing had a problem with that my bf in high school would get mad if i told him i cant see him because i have to study it was last year of hs and i needed to do good to get into college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should rethink your username
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga had drafts before this one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you lost a best friend from an ultimatum your girl gave you your buddy lost an average friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bros over hoes you got whats comin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre putting it down with her on the regular and aint nobody dying wtf else is there to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what i was thinkin well see who plays the codependence game better me or her theres never really a winner tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats her number
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have mostly learned that if it works it works dont worry about the platitudes the exceptions and all that nonsense both of you just be happy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mc skat cat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres always an exception to the rule that sounds like a pretty solid relationship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys run game girls run game but if you got no friends you fucked up somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,text me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,release meeeeeww
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well lets see here sarah christina monique yolanda keisha teisha sabrina oh shit im sorry i get myself mixed up with petey pablo too much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im not sure if its just a maturity level thing or what i remember being much more attached to my girlfriends when i was younger now that im almost i just want someone cool to hang out and sleep over a couple times a week all that texting and hanging out days a week is unnecessary
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do well hope you got into college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,silence manlet do not speak to your superior fun fact if you ever have trouble going to sleep just mix bleach and rat poison together and drink it puts you right to sleep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or made a dumb decision because he thought he was in love with a girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait idk whose side ur taking tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you both win and wind up with a stable marriage that lasts giving your kids a pretty good upbringing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga thats not a rule you just made it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no friends doesnt mean nobody to hang with it means not choosing to chill with the people you could chill with because they are wack no company is better than bad company man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but for real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you cant stand hanging out with someone frequently should you really be with them bruh and multiple jobs the fuck you mean
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not all colleges are located in english speaking countries brah
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if youre young enough to get involved with women playing games like that youre not motivated by love thats your penis talking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im saying she got no reason to be textingcalling all the time if nobodys dying and shes getting the d on the regular
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boy you must be joking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if the whole world is a problem youre probably the problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well by multiple jobs i mean she has jobs lol and i think your misinterpreting what im saying i love my girl and i could hang out with her all the time but its more that we respect each others own personal lives and dont have to in other words if i tell her i already have plans or that im hanging out with a friend she doesnt throw a fit or get jealous or anything she just accepts it and says shell see me later and vice versa if she tells me shes busy i just accept it and move on we both recognize that there are other people in our lives and that while our relationship is a priority it doesnt immediately trump any and all other plans we both have a lot of friends outside of our relationship and those maintaining those relationships are important as well which typically means we only hang out times a week and im okay with that i just think its important to respect each others outside personal relationships ive seen too many couples who glob onto each other too soon and lose friends outside the relationship because theyre too wrapped up in their new partner i dont wanna do that and i dont wanna be with someone would put me in the position to do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not all colleges are located in english speaking countries brah bruh ftfy fucking foreigners s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not even thats just fuckin stupid a girl tells meme or your best friend bye bitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah cuz you can tell them apart at that age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you are friends with the whole world what the hell are you smoking you can only be friends with those in your immediate environment yes i understand that you could very well be the problem but understand that problematic people are usually never alone lol people love drama people will have people as friend just for entertainment of the train wreck that they are lol to not get away from the point a woman can be normal and choose not to hang with those in her environment because they are detrimental to her objectives in life if you have had friends in life you can understand that they majority of them are only out for themselves and will step on your neck the first moment they can
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh ok yeah when you said multiple i was like shit man jobs is kinda dumb but yeah all of that is great but be prepared for the possibility of all of that ending one day if you end up in a legitimately serious relationship or married everything else will become second not because they expect it but because you want it that way ill get off my soapbox now lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he still went with it even though myself and our other friends told him not to do so but did anyways now he regrets it but is too afraid to say anything to her in fear of her leaving
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real tho girls make ultimatums women are smart enough to have respect for the homies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol nah i dont have her working that hard lmao oh and i understand thats just not what im looking for at this time in my life once i get into that kind of relationship ill be completely down for that but as of right now thats not my thing i dont wanna hop from super committed relationship to super committed relationship only to realize i sacrificed large parts of my younger years for people who are no longer in my life me and my girl love each other but we realize that were both still young and still want to very much be seperate people and that this relationship while lovely more than likely isnt the end all be all for either of us neither of us wants the other to resent us if we break up neither of us wants the other to look back and say i never did because of you or i never went because you wouldnt let me we want each other to have as many experiences as possible while still being together youre certainly right that one day sacrifices will need to be made in a relationship but at and i dont think you should be sacrificing for anyone unless theres a child involved were young and beautiful its our time to be selfish and we shouldnt waste it i dont wanna get to having sacrificed for wasted relationships only realizing i need to do something for myself id much rather burn myself out now and then when im ready be full on psyched to hop into a heavily committed relationship anyway thats my path ive decided to take ill get off my soapbox too lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need to be on good terms with the homies i thought it was common knowledge but so many girls act stupid about it im not excited about my bfs friendship with one guy who does a lot of drugs but i wouldnt try to get between them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know shes pissed about us but instead of dropping people and making people drop friends talk to them about the issue thats just being childish and insecure as fuck since you think itll help solve the issue but it never goes away even if you drop people so handle that shit like an adult something ive been trying to teach for the longest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah name him supernin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im curious which country has the word tendo as a name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant wait for super mario run to drop and its ios only at first suck it android users edit i knew this would get downvoted but i just want to see the world burn kanye shrug

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bugz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,potential repost title lugz life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just gonna leave this here before this thread gets locked credit ugeekaesthete imagine that youre sitting down to dinner with your family and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal you dont get any so you say i should get my fair share and as a direct response to this your dad corrects you saying everyone should get their fair share now thats a wonderful sentiment indeed everyone should and that was kinda your point in the first place that you should be a part of everyone and you should get your fair share also however dads smartass comment just dismissed you and didnt solve the problem that you still havent gotten any the problem is that the statement i should get my fair share had an implicit too at the end i should get my fair share too just like everyone else but your dads response treated your statement as though you meant only i should get my fair share which clearly was not your intention as a result his statement that everyone should get their fair share while true only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out thats the situation of the black lives matter movement culture laws the arts religion and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter clearly that message already abounds in our society the problem is that in practice the world doesnt work the way you see the film nightcrawler you know the part where renee russo tells jake gyllenhal that she doesnt want footage of a black or latino person dying she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed thats not made up out of whole cloth there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience who are white can identify with so when a young black man gets killed prior to the recent police shootings its generally not considered news while a middleaged white woman being killed is treated as news and to a large degree that is accurate young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers which is why we dont treat it as anything new but the result is that societally we dont pay as much attention to certain peoples deaths as we do to others so currently we dont treat all lives as though they matter equally just like asking dad for your fair share the phrase black lives matter also has an implicit too at the end its saying that black lives should also matter but responding to this by saying all lives matter is willfully going back to ignoring the problem its a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means only black lives matter when that is obviously not the case and so saying all lives matter as a direct response to black lives matter is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem tldr the phrase black lives matter carries an implicit too at the end its saying that black lives should also matter saying all lives matter is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is alllivesmatter really a thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am surprised this has not been locked yet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so id like to represent the white delegation for a second here i used to say all lives matter and heres why these are all statistics that i remember from when i was a sophomore in high school btw black men ages are the most likely to get killed by cops but the second most likely are native american men ages not only that but there has also been a systematic oppression of native american peoples in which the native americans were also enslaved and continue to be oppressed just like black men second i thought that only focusing on racial prejudices in police would take away from the overall brutality and overmilitarization of police forces of course i dont think that way now i understand that blm doesnt seek to marginalize other races struggles and concerns in the way that alm does and i understand that we cant tackle every police issue at once and that focusing on one issue like racism is the way to make real change have a good day everyone edit since im getting backlash i just wanted to explain myself again this is really how some white people think and they honest to god dont think theyre being racist or anti black they really dont i was just trying to offer a different perspective and if that really offended you then shit im sorry i didnt think it was that offensive anyhoe if somebody supports all lives matter instead of immediately calling them anti black or racist try to understand where theyre coming from so you guys can work together to understand eachother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all lives do matter just because its obvious doesnt mean its not true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,americanlivesmatter native american
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,blm all the way but im on the mens rights movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ide put my hand over her mouth any day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have a feeling i can use this for an essay sometime soon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not american but feel like blm in the uk is america sneezing and the uk catching a cold as far as i can tell by looking at statistics the representation of death under police custody stands at black since which is an underrepresented figure of the black population i wont argue that all are treated equal here that would be anecdotal and its not my experience to talk for but blm nah and while were at it what does looting a mcdonalds do but undermine the whole cause making themselves look like idiots smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sadly yes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sit down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as an indigenous person naw dont use us as reason to be antiblack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trundle pls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the actions of a few should not take away from the idea of the movement when you have a movement that is that large it is inevitable that there will be some fucktards that come in and mess things up this however does not represent the movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the issue here is that it is dismissing and silencing their cause for example during the civil rights movement a popular picket sign read i am a man this doesnt mean black men are the only men or better men this just meant yea me too to follow up that statement with oh well everyone is a man so is this police officer is fucking ignorant and stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre leaking red everywhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,facts saved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u gettin downvoted but u right england has way less black folk gettin shot blm shouldnt be as huge in terms of trying to protect lives
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt realize having an opinion made people so mad maybe if people tried to see it from other peoples perspectives for once we wouldnt have so many problems if yall actually read it you would have seen that i realized why that thought process was wrong and changed it but whatever im an ignorant white bitch i guess
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was never anti black ever in my life i was really just trying to offer a different perspective i could have used latino indian on asian as well and also if you actually read what i wrote i never used you as a reason to be anti black so dont twist my words thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is there really a movement who is in charge what is their agenda how do they plan on going about enacting change other than footstomping in the streets and putting blm posters and stickers up blm activists like to compare themselves to the civil rights movement of the but their operation is woefully disorganized and has nothing to bring to the table but shouting black lives matter while blocking interstates during my morning commute the naacp contemporary with the civil rights movement was a wellorchestrated machine that organized the boycotts and sitins of the time but ultimately it was their capacity for true effective political pressure that yielded their success this blm movement wants all the respect of that movement without any of the actual legwork that goes into pushing their agenda like their predecessors did no movement has been sustained by protest alone not gandhi not nelson mandela and not even mlk if thats all that blm can bring to the table they should not be surprised when their public outcry falls on deaf ears but i slightly disagreed with you so im sure youve closed your mind to anything i have to say by now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they shut down gay festivals to get their own message across they dont care about anything else than race they encourage white hate some think that killing white officers was justified they try to fight hate by hating at innocent people its a very bad movement that has just like feminism lost track of the real problems in society black on black crime is far far worse and kills many more blacks than police officers do instead of trying to fix this blm attacks white people and innocent white police officers rather than police officers who use excessive force and of course racist police and police who use excessive force should be sentenced to jail but blm believes that every time black man is killed by a police man its because the police man is racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree with every thing you are saying but correct me if im wrong not just saying this i very well could be wrong didnt the all lives matter stuff start after the incidents where police were shot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe we just have different agendas but part our mens rights charity encompasses encouraging young black men to go to school to have access to mental health services and funding for starts up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,instead of us taking the time to understand why some white people would support alm why dont you take seconds to see what blm is about im not wasting my time googling alm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well said blm thinks that standing and screaming in the middle of the street will help however heshe is sadly not probably going to read your comment because heshe disagrees with you also the mods deleted my first comment which said smh blm is so stupid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow man that last comment was unnecessary youve made your point there is no need to call me close minded and yes sure there is no real organization in blm i misspoke by calling it a movement the problem with blm is that there isnt a real leader and it really came about to discuss how the police are not accountable for their actions you mentioned how blm inconvenienced you but didnt consider what for what you dont think those sit ins inconvenienced others or the marches or even the part when rosa did not give up her seat what you think that did not make people late and angry dealing with all of that again sure their methods may not be the best but you tell me what method is how do people who have been put down for years come together and solve this issue what do you want them to do anytime someone brings up any sort of injustice people are quick to say well thats not true or what about this group things start with protests my friend things start with discussion and a little inconvenience sure it would be nice if there was another way but there is not especially when people are quick to shut them down because they are inconvenienced
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,again the actions of a few does not speak for what the movement is about yes it is true that some of them assault officers but thats with every individual that is not okay the media just talks about it when its a black person as delegitimization of the movement and what about black on black crime why do people never talk about white on white crime or asian on asian crime what we tend to forget is that areas are still very much segregated so you are more likely to be assaulted by someone who looks like you especially when the area is impoverished
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no all lives matter started as a rebuttal to black lives matter blue lives matter started after the dallas shooting of the police officers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i did take the time to understand what blm is about and thats why im a supporter of blm but it took someone explaining it to me to understand they sat down they listened and they told me why i was wrong they didnt just call me racist and move on with their day and i really thank them for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and what are the alternatives then what would you suggest that the movement does to fix the issue because honestly even since the civil rights movement racism is still very much alive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way to combat systematic oppression is through a systematic approach and to this end isolated and disorganized boycottssitins are the antithetical the history of civil rights activism shows that the actual activity of protest in and of itself accomplishes nothing in practically every case of a boycott or other protesting action the actual socioeconomic impact loss of profits inconvenientuncomfortable travel etc is negligible and not the endgame of the activity rather the organizers and activists of these movements made deliberate efforts to highly publicize these events to sway public opinion to the right side of history and worked with local journalists and public officials to evoke change its not a matter of disagreement toward the methods of the blm protesters or to paraphrase mlk they neednt wait for a more convenient season to pursue equality its the fact that no group has ever brought about change through the methods employed by the blm protesters so not only are their demonstrations an exercise in futility they dissuade people from joining or supporting their cause by causing damage and inconvenience to their local communities which in turn pushes more people away who may have been sympathetic to their cause its really hard to want to support someone who will blindly accuse you of being racist simply based on the color of your skin enter irony of the blm movement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,calm down and try to understand what youre actually talking about the media just talks about it when its a black person as delegitimization of the movement the media is praising blm of the time they made them famous why do people never talk about white on white crime or asian on asian crime is there an asian lives matter movement again the subject here is black lives keep it at that for now please asian on asian crime or white on white crime is irrelevant when talking about black lives isnt that obvious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right on reddit learns people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of course racism is alive fascism is alive islamism is alive a lot of isms are alive but blm is saying that institutional racism is alive in america and that it is something systematic the blm movement confuses normal racism with something entirely different standing on the street saying the same three words black lives matter and hating white people for what a minority of white people do isnt helping anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well said and i agree the issue with the whole movement is that it is not centralized there is no order and unfortunately i dont think there will be any time soon because the vocal minority has been as you said dissuading people from the main cause what i am trying to argue is that we should not allow the vocal minority to represent what the cause is trying to solve and that is issues with police accountability
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you literally just missed my entire argument
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its the majority not the minority thats bad and harmful did you even read ops comment

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love ghost and the rest of the wu but to say that they sound the same is insulting to both lyricists really ghost paints abstract pictures pairs well with anyone and is a masterful storyteller bronsolinho is a walk on the wild side spitting outlandish shit with extravagance rare drug references impeccable artistic culinary lingo to say that they sound the same is oversimplifying both of their styles to such a degree that its not worth mentioning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i can really speak for anyone else maybe it is a regional thing considering people seem to agree with you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know what your major is but algebra is the prereq for a lot of maths stop worrying about that boys number and get to worrying about those numbers a concerned parent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are you doing your homework are you going to your profs office hours in algebra you can only be asked how to solve a problem so many ways do your homework and ask a prof for help leave the boys alone until you get your grades up

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its due to the fact that the kid was black but honestly the mother should be ashamed kid was dumb af but hes shes an adult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thatsthejoke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,smh ten minutes in and we got a black fathers arent there joke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh so you respect the gorilla but not your own ma fine why didnt it raise your bitch ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yall lucky if i talked back no words would have come from my mom only the back of her hand to my mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scared for life damn lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if it got out no living human would stand a chance in fight with it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those dudes are majestic af def my favorite primates not as aggressive as chimps but not mellow like bonobos either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which zoo did you go to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck off not everythings racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better on a leash than dead lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,could be from the islands we use um regularly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is how you properly use this slang 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was affirming it thats why i added fr didnt need to reply to my shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would ban but ive seen usoupdup enough to know that shes not a racist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i may have put you in to this world but that gorilla should have taken you out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao havent laughed so hard in a long time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean i got hitwhooped too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i never made it past a dirty look
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,word
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holyshit he just tossed the baby gorilla like here nigga take yo shit then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chicago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but thats a poor argument as to why something isnt i explained my reasoning for saying why i viewed it as racist edit i forgot there was a video so not outright racist but still is kinda weird to be concerned about the race of the kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,um
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a non island dweller what are the islands
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no i was just letting him know in case he didnt know and guessed that it was spelled um spell it anyway you want my comment was meant as just an fyi
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you affirm with an upvote
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is it though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no it isnt keep shitty jokes like that to yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what was that boy flip flop twitches
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do you actually know what racism is or do you just not like discussing race
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better starving abandoned by their parents and restrained to a street lamp than dead lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,something every person on every group of different islands refers to them as
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i affirm how i please
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,edit now that i think about it i forgot there was a video so they could be discussing that if the race of the kid in the video was hard to make out so while not racist its still kind of a weird thing to focus on in the video why would the race of the kid matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,um
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i like that attitude upaffirmed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes but youve done it wrong this time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would it matter you do know what sub youre on right for fucks sake peopleculturesreligionsraces and so on are all different and discussing things in context to that isnt inherently racist its much more racist to hyper focus on not worrying about race and in that understate and undermine the differences and uniqueness of people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,doesnt matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is obviously anecdotal but from my experiences plenty of my black friends throw kill yourself around pretty loosely almost like take this l but among my white friends and on reddit its considered taboo and going too far and all that just one of those cultural things i suppose
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the troll intentionally made a racist joke right after i told another user not too ill delete my comment though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cool story bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah lol say kill yourself to a white friend and everyone in the room turns into the disoriented krabs meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really its all about the context if mglln was just kidding i wouldnt have said anything but you cant in a serious conversation hop up on a high horse saying dont be racist and then follow that up with telling someone to kill themselves all of my friends of every color make jokes about suicide not cultural differences just known when its not a big deal to joke about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fair enough ill delete mine too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you say a lot of racist shit on here but its cool tho because youre a mod and talk about white people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh im sorry did you suddenly stop caring about racism or something seemed pretty concerned about it before
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always upvote mglln
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly the only reason i came at you was you werent joking entirely if someone makes a shitty racist comment and then its followed up by a shitty suicide comment then thats not cool you cant chastise someone for being racist while telling them to kill themselves its contradictory id be lying if i said i never told someone to kill themselves ive said it plenty but i always meant it as a joke in a context i was clearly joking in that case i would probably laugh it off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah its cool because hes funny and nobody gives a fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought it was a cool story bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so you have the gall to try and call others out for being racist but when called out on your own subtle racism you just get defensive and resort to memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are your jimmies being rustled bro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this women are the devil week because my ex still hasnt shown me her titties since she got the boob job and im on board
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this the equivalent of the dude that says no fatugly chicks or something meanwhile he got a peg leg a hunchback and eczema
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god damn did this whole sub collectively get rejected by their crush a couple days ago or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is just a one time thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i once dated a coworker who said shed never marry someone who worked the same job as she did she had a point but makes you sound like a shitty person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sometimes the most convenient route isnt the cheapest route
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god damn man all that karma in days respect the grind💪🏽 you out here poundin pavement👊🏽 no breaks😤💯
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you help pay for them titties cause thats some bullshit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the part about the whole shit on women trend on here lately that annoys me the most is that if someone identifies themselves as a girl on this sub they get thirsted over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jesus fuck no shes just been teasing me with em and im determined to witness them irl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo she may deadass be a succubus thats cruel
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better hope you get that stay home text
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,safety tip you always gotta be nice to at least two of the weird kids that sit in the back of the class mumbling to themselves
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,calling it in a week or two full blown courage memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this they also say the funniest shit and no one notices me and my friends end up crackin up cause that one kid is roastin the fuck outta everyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bold prediction i think youre right though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if i could fuck her in front of all these passengers theyd prob think im a terrorist

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pac had a line about how his mom nearly gave her life to raise him right and he still bitches when all he had to do was relatively easier than what she went through i believe its from the song dear mama
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah thats what happened inside xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u still didnt say what u went in for homie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i guess why she can make hit after hit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its been about years for me and honestly i have my ups and downs if anything i just got way more jaded and cynical at an earlier age im finally starting to get out of that mode of thinking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive been doing a lot better actually since i was so young when it happened i didnt realize how serious and life changing it really was until my sophomore year of high school it hit me like bricks and made me really depressed i was on the edge of fucking myself up drugs and sex until i die but was able to retain myself because i became the man of the house couldnt leave my brothers theyd end up with no father and no older brother to look up to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah man ive heard it before its a very powerful song
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know yall niggas to get too specific lets just say karma is real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good for you man its tough shit to recover from growing through your teens without a male figure can be fucking rough but you gotta know that he would be proud of you if he could see you now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel you on being too young to really understand it it was probably around sophomore year that it clicked for me too mad respect for manning up and taking charge thats not something all year olds could manage your family is lucky to have you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,u was trappin wasnt u
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hell yeah man i didnt really realize that having a male figure was pretty important until after the fact and yeah man thats something that always keep me encouraged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i appreciate that a lot man its crazy how reddit works sometimes just last week i was called retarded and now im telling deep parts of my life and being empathetic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,walking into a holding cell in florida with other angry black dudes with almost nowhere to sit was a hostile environment i remember this huge dude from new orleans with the tear drop said he was gonna fuck me and then kill me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in that environment with those people but naw i did some dirt to get money i never needed though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and in bpt of all subs huh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit like i wouldnt even know how to respond to someone saying that theyre going to fuck me if they say that they want to fuck me up sure i can prepare for that but what he saidthats far too wild for me

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe hear me out just maybe everyone has different taste that isnt dependant on the color of their skin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a white ass name my boys all named trevor have been white 😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have you seen atlanta its a reference to a black guy who identified as a white guy and throws out a bunch of stereotypes liking ipas is one of them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive met a couple of trevors that werent white they were from england
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude black people love mayonnaise
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this view always misses the point its not the getting as and working hard thats looked down upon its the attitude from thats oftentimes behind it that is often what we dont care for

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with this fire mixtape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how sway you aint got the answers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cause they dont know shit about money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was their college tuition money their parents saved up for nothing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that gwagon has a really condescending look on its face
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its because they have a gpa and a sat score
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good to be optimistic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,canadian here cause we dont have gpa and sat what do they meando and is a higher score better or worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can make plans for world domination or learning magic doesnt mean shit

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what watch is that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well is it a lady your gpa and sat score mean little in your ability to land a rich guy if you are a hottie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rich people can afford bad grades
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same motherfuckers who insist they will win the lottery
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you forget cocaine addicts dont ask if you have a year degree
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the fuck is this champagne anyway i always see it on look how rich i am pictures
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the farthest they end up with is a mid level civic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still wondering how all these dumbass people who didnt go to college are partying everyday going to vegas every weekend and driving nice cars i went to a private school so i dont know if its the parents money or what 🤔
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well to be fair even a college degree doesnt guarantee things like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok so i got a degree in electrical power control and instrumentation i know guys who sit in front of monitors hit a couple of switches every now and again they make an hour they have full benefits insurance etc these dudes are in their mid twenties no kids and very small school loans to pay back and im talking between to its very easy once you know and understand what needs to be happening ive seen what other people do for work and im thankful for doing all that school and shit because now im a controls tech at texas instrument and have a easy work schedule compared to most people oh and i had a job halfway into the last semester most guys did at my school the field im in are dying for workers they even pay moving incentives and sign on bonuses shit some companies come to my school to exclusively recruit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to quote rick james cocaine is a helluva drug especially for the dealers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,real success is not having to wear a watch or just being a bum but also being so successful that it doesnt matter when you arrive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one of my favorite shower thoughts was rap music is poor black people pretending to be rich country music is rich white people pretending to be poor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch how its because people dont realize that big time drug dealers are smart people not some corner thug that ascended to god status their plan is im going to be the next kingpin and in reality theyre not entrepreneurial enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because their parents are rich and spoil their kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my little sister xd constantly posting shit about how important school is hey sis hows your grades lookin oh good yep also cant hold down all the an hour jobs she gets in the past months meanwhile my wife and i both go to a university full time while taking care of our son

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol as a liberal arts major working fast food right now this thread hits me right in the feels
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyve been teaching you that college is necessary since you were kids because the economy has been shit in an ideal economy stacking degrees and any college for that matter wouldnt be necessary because the job market would be flourished
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh i hear there are some lucrative jobs that dont check your gpa or sat score mostly sales marketing chemical engineering its drugs im talking about drugs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id hate to be that guy but gpa and sat score dont determine your intelligence and what kind of job you can get it determines how fed up with school you are and if youre still trying i know tons of people who had shit grades and now have great jobs with career opportunity
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rich parents has money but no way to replenishment therefore no foresight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like gpa is any indication of how u gonna do after school fuck out of here god damn drones
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,daddys oil field

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,these people are always on their fucking grind like no shade but dont be bragging that youre all about your money when you make an hour and still live with your momma i dont go around saying this cuz im broke af and live at home too lol but i know my place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reminds me of people who wake up at like am snapchat something like back to the grind then go back to sleep cause they have no fucking job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im so glad i didnt become this i always had the mindset that everytbing would play out how its meant to and shit like that its what my parents always said tbh i wish they had pushed me a little harder i didnt get into the college course i wanted and was doing nothing for a while until i met my girlfriend she gave me the kick in the ass i needed and i got back into education and just recently finished top of my class and on the way to my dream college after another year people who say shit like this spend too much time saying and not enough doing i would know cause that was me for so long

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,living the reddit dream
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drugs are expensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey thats me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,voice of experience here you can make money doing that yes but by the time you get to your body will be shot i know guys under on long term disability right now working on the tools your whole life is a hard life but can be rewarding very much financially my advise is be a union electrician instead of welder
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah most redditors have no idea you can actually make so much money in the trades youll have to start working as a laborer for a while before you can even start an apprenticeship and then have go to school but even then in most areas labour still pays like or an hour
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,instrumentation tech working in canada here starting wages for a year apprentice with no experience and no schooling is and only goes up from there based on what year of your apprenticeship youre on the schooling is inexpensive and some companies may even sponsor you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,last year as a working man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres a pot head i knew he moved up to alaska and makes a year running an air delivery service for the oil companies so much easy money with oil companies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a hard worker that part is important i will never judge a highschool dropout who works hard or a college dropout who works hard or someone who goes to trade school and works hard i have friends like that and they are all alright for themselves because they have plans and goals and they know how to attain them i think posts like this are about those deadbeats who drop out and brag about how rich they are going to be but you know damn well they have neither the drive nor the smarts to end up anywhere other than some dead end job they hate that they keep getting fired from because they show up high everyday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had a boss jack of all trades type who did some grayarea deals the guy had an eighth grade education but managed to retire to hawaii with a million dollar net worth not bad for a back woods guy running a maintenance crew
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one thing i wont do pay for pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two words russian parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,username checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,search rich kids of instagram
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when lupe when
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,chilli sauce on the panda
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ace of spades goes for to a couple thousand depending on the size of the bottle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,armand de brignac or colloquially known as ace of spades owned by jayz
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey you gotta start somewhere
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,drop outta school now we dumb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look up your schools average gpaits probably i remember one time classmate picked up jamals report card everyone was laughing how he got a d in weightlifting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,friendship there are other things to live than your career
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its out of now i know people that got
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when i was in highschool i really wanted a perfect score so i was attending after school sat study sessions i was talking with a guy wanting to move his to a and i was like on the reading or math section and his eyes sunk and said on combined i felt awful i was in there trying to move my to a and there were people failing to get even and you wonder why these people dont go to college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually it goes to now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i work with high school students and have seen those scores some schools will test their entire junior class to make sure they take it and some of those kids honestly just dont care
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my experience people with rich parents dont usually bomb school their parents didnt get rich by being stupidunmotivated and even if the kid is a lazy sack of shit at least some of that rubs off on them even the worst lazy rich kids ive met at least had like a b average maybe some cs in hard classes a couple as in easy classes i mean most kids of rich parents ive met throughout school have been pretty smart and hard working which makes sense since their parents are presumably smarthardworking as well otherwise they wouldnt be rich lol like if you grow up in a home with smartmotivated parents who value education who value hard work and have the resources to provide you with essentially unlimited academic assistance tutors sat prep etc its really hard not to at least do passably ok even if you put in literally zero effort its kids who grow up in households with parents who dont give a shit about education that bomb school obviously there are always extreme examples on both sides of the bell curve but thats generally what ive seen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,minimum total score is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what are the easy ones cmon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i can taste the disappointment in themselves redirected as pure salt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good grades dont get you money but having bad grades can definitely stop you from getting money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,two years out of school is way too early to say grades dont get you x or y im sure youll find something soon dont give up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with that impressive gpa internshipsresearch positions shouldve been easy to acquire if you hadnt pursued them in college well tough luck grad school awaits brother
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good grades dont get you money but they keep doors open for you to get a competitive internship or research experience which is what actually leads to money not sitting on your grades and hoping a job will land on your lap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah its not a joke or anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gpa means you passed highschool with the bear minimum or higher is best of the class most people are in between and
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for the sat the higher score the better also many people in the states take the act same grade wise higher the better
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not worth wondering about almost anyone can pull a rabbit out of their ass once and awhile and convince people it wasnt a magic trick
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how is real success not having to wear a watch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one does not buy these watches to know what time it is you buy them to show that you can
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because they are expensive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or maybe dont hope for the downfall of successful people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch yes it does if not intelligence then work ethic which is arguably more important if you cant get above a in high school then youre just lazy as fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre downvoted but oilfield rats make bank
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,could you explain im not the one who downvoted you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we always had a feeling you were retarded
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,awesome that you had a nice witch at your graduation party
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do you get a and cant spell which public school system thats how stupid kid in my private school class gets straight fs goes to public school system gets in all honors classes and makes straight as wth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gonna start selling dope again
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah some year old told me this a couple of days ago he said hes going to buy about houses in the next couple of years to flip and sell so that he can retire by i just said bruh and walked away
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my father in law is doing this he previously owned a landscaping company commercial landscaping not even residential he had some mild success with the first couple houses sold to familyfriendsacquaintances and has now decided to buy and restore old classic cars he knows even less about car mechanics than contracting so currently there are old piece of shit not running classic cars chilling in the garages of the homes he is flipping yeah its going well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real though everyone acts like just because you watch hgtv means that you can flip houses
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every highschool crew has one member like this for mine it was selling shirts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everyone without any formal education seems to think they can flip houses
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got a friend whos new years resolution every year is to stop smoking weed and get serious about football to make it to the nfl lol we graduated high school years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and man you dont even get fired from pizza restaurants for being high otherwise theyd have no employees you gotta be that high
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,self employed at hutla makin that money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have a guy i used to work with on fb who got fired when he was a manager at my old location the dumbass was stealing from the safe every night he worked like do you think a company wouldnt see that shit in the reports hes always posting about him and his grind but he buys expensive appliances every month it seems and says he never has money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,distinction too high as some of the hardest workers i know are only partially high and not mostly dead
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we all know someone like that a friend of a friend is constantly posting his pay stubs i live in toronto canada for reference saying that hard work pays off and im all 😐😐😐😐
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know a similar kid a huge fucking weirdo who discovered smoking weed his senior year barely graduated hs then got fired from his pizza job which i worked with him at for being too high kid actually thought the fact that he smoked more weed than me made him cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they never proved shit manager just got mad for no reason
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly you can be on your grind making minimum wage living with your momma but theres usually a difference between someone who shows it off and someone who doesnt the ones who constantly show off their grind online usually arent smart with their money they earn and would rather show it off with dumb purchases the ones who remain quiet with their grind know not to show off and to be smart financially
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like those people that post everyone out in the club this weekend but gotta stay grindin noyall just work weekends
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you feel like your life is shit someones you just gotta hold on to the fantasy feel bad for these people more than anything they cant just be happy with who they are
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit man ive made an hour and im still broke as fuck and i live with my parents
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man i used to have a friend like that we all knew that he got fired from being a fucking mcdonalds cashier but he still woke up at to take a timestamped snapchat in his uniform and put some stupid caption about working hard he would always avoid the subject until we actually went to the mcds at and called him asking where he was we knew he had been fired we just wanted him to at least admit it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same here parents never pushed me that hard so i didnt take school as serious i wasnt a bad student either but the only reason for good grades was for the self satisfaction that eventually dimmed out by highschool i felt like i was only giving at everything i did junior year i took an ap class and finally felt the push i needed to get back into gear seeing my peers excel so high above motivated me to do better along with an awesome teacher ended with a b or b but i felt like i couldve put more work im going to cc in a month with an itch to be the best as corny as that sounds
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,have family member selling body wrapscant believe they think its a real job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wtf is a body wrap google just yields pictures of people wrapping themselves in cellophane and measuring their waistlines
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not bad for a highschooler post tax
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or probably more accurately really good at sports with shitty grades
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right lol half the ppl commenting are just self reflecting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah most redditors have no idea you can actually make so much money in the trades i dunno man i basically only hear about this from redditors
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think op was more calling these people lazy rather than saying the only way to make a lot of money is college but then again the whole reddit stem circle jerk is real edit turns out theres a jerk for all forms of education
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i made an hour overtime doing construction last summer course they never tell you that if it comes time to start racking up overtime hours that theyll just send your ass home lol im not sure i ever worked past on a friday
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most redditors have no idea you can actually make so much money in the trades we dont because anytime college or education or similar is mentioned half the comments are spam fucking the thread with we could always use more kids in trade school yeah we get it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont want to be that guy but still to an hour isnt much at all an hour is only a year ive got friends that are laborers on oil rigs and they make a lot of money but an hour is not much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty envious of trade workers sometimes take a plumber for instance probably half the calls they get are stupid shit that take minutes yet they charge they are usually booked solid for at least a week in advance as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no ones talking about that though this is about the guy who cant stop getting high doesnt want a job where theyre making someone else money and still going to the club every weekend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i make more than that and cant travel the world i could probably drive to nashville at some point in the future
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have gone to school and recieved my associates degree in auto tech still a lube tech making an hour
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good indemand laborers can make over an hour
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure he was pointing that out as the bottom end
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cant you just go to school and then just go right into a trades job
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i earn an hour as an electrician but ive never been to college or did any apprenticeshipjourneyman stuff then again i have years of experience
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah the trades pay well they have to because by the time you are in your late your back knees and most of your joints are shot and you cant work anymore thats the trade off i hope you saved it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill never understand reddits anticollege protrade school fetish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i worked skilled industrial trades most my life and all of it was in unions thing i liked was in the industries i was in ocean freighters industrial construction all the jobs were time contracts of usually months so id work a few months with massive overtime and then collect ui cause contract offreduction in force one long contract or a couple short ones per year and i was doing just fine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive finished with my apprenticeship sponsored through all nchnc now being sponsored through my degree as an electrical tech
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what do you do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn how thats full time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so he has a plane or what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah never getting married like me smart man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hohohooo but you will
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ayy never seen someone quote mac
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she get a bunch of money spend it all on drugs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just pay for the shit surrounding the pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dick dont pay for strange
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as if my parents would allow me to drink something with such a bad price to taste ratio more like a rolex and veuve clinquot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh fucking god why i have never seen so much lack of taste
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy crap i think that singlehandedly made me want to vote for bernie almost
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes i do why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or i can buy a bottle of dom and a escort
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they apparently cost a bottle to produce source
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how it taste tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so its terrible and people pay for the name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jayz champagne lol stupid white kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why you gotta do jamal like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that good thats like half the maximum below average i dont know if your comment is supposed to be insinuating that is good or bad around your area
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,per section and now theres three sections so it goes to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually they changed it back to
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kids of rich people who are selfmade from a long hard career are generally smart and hardworking themselves kids of rich people who either inherited their money or struck it rich from commodities eg oil and oil fields tend to be lazy and mediocre source went to high school in texas among these kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre all pretty easy once you learn them not to reduce the skill associated with these jobs but welding pipe fitting plumbers you could make an hour within months of doing any of those trades and if your good and network properly get yourself an hour within years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh this kind of shit is tacky no matter how much money you have
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont i wish them the best but personal experience seems to have set the odds against them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,correct
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sad but true statement
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont give a shit about downvotes so you got nothing to worry about and if you wanna get a glimpse of whats going on in most colleges these days then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,moms what can you do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thank goodness i didnt have to type all my essays on my cracked lg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,copy this status and repost it if you want to keep me as a friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like my pubes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta thank the little homie nas for that though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bitch we all know you cant afford a house with a lawn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god dammit ricky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not a bad option but itd be better to fix them up and rent them out for some nice passive income using a real estate agency
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair my sisters ex boyfriend does this he now owns homes and partial owner of high rise buildings but hes also a genius and works hours a day hes all grind and got in when the market here was cheap i live in vancouver hes made a killing due to our ridiculous real estate prices
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my cousin said that at around except he said more than and retire by now hes and works in an office all day of his own company where he flipsrenos and owns housesdamn him d
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a good plan if you have the ability to fix the houses yourself and youre good at negotiating the purchase and sale of homes and youre able to intelligently determine how much a house can be sold for with the improvements you make and whether the neighborhood is rising or falling and other than a few small nuanced things along the way youll be set
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think he just wanted some old school cars everyone has project cars maybe the promises of profit were just to slip it past the wife theyll let you buy anything if you convince them its profitable although theyll stop believing you if its consistently not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need an insane amount of starting cash to do this too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my area every house has seen a double digit increase in value annually theyre all bought and sold without inspection too even you literally cant lose buying any house in my city in the entire last decade all you need is the capital
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so when is he announcing his eligibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit i knew a dude just like that and he never even played football in high school because he was constantly in alternative school for being a douche now hes trying to become a personal trainer when he himself pops xans and percs constantly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man when i was in high school you wouldnt believe how many people i met saying they were going to make it into the nba and werent even cut out to make the varsity teams
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is his name rico
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were all waiting for josh stop smoking weed and get serious about football
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he should thank his dealer for how good the shit was dude that shit was so good i got fired from a pizza place
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm used to frequent my pizza job high only moderately though not to blazed as balls levels and everyone else there was usually high as well nobody got mad if you made a small stoney mistake the boss usual response was ey smoke another one there kid and the only guy i know to get fired for being inebriated kept forgetting to put cheese on the pizzas he cooked about cheeseless pizzas in one shift when he was blatantly off his ass on something and got fired
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,high school school of hard knocks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,education school of hard nocks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats almost enough to rent an apartment but not anywhere in toronto p
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in to 😂😂 enough to buy him a bedroom cardboard box
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre just made cause youre just a little pussy bitch who gets outsmoked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,man anybody could have cooked that pizza without the cheese just because i am the pizza chef doesnt mean i fucked it up they aint got shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,being financially responsible doesnt mean they cant make dumb purchases once in awhile i grind because i want to be able to flex once in awhile
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,please explain this being on their grind phrase
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i moved in with my dad for a year after graduation to save up what would be rent money i did his chores around the house and cooked and cleaned to pay for me staying with him i did have the benefit of a salaried position that was much better than minimum wage but i still was on my grind so i could afford my own place nothing wrong with moving in with your parents if you have a plan and arent a free loader
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not happy with who i am but i just quietly do a bunch of drugs like a normal person
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how after you take out the cost of my rent hydro car insurance id probably make less than that and its not half bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not corny kill it at the cc and move on to a year and kill it there too thats a great game plan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know what you mean in respect to your work ethic i wasnt pushed but i wasnt a bad student either in fact i was quite good up until the last year and a half of school and i just stopped caring i guess ditto about the friends too it was their success that pushed me on i wanted to be like them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do it youll probably come out ahead since you can get all your prerequisite classes out of the way for cheap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think its for cars like a vinyl wrap but i could be totally wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats crazy for a highschooler think about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a high schooler but not an adult using that as primary income
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well are they bragging about playing sports or simply going to an ncaa school
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exactly that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh you dont know me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol thats true has anybody mentioned mike rowe yet i could also give you my own personal anecdote about working electrical too but sadly im a redditor too though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i kinda wonder if its similar to how you can make a ton of money by being am entrepreneur sure you can but most wont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit also has a anticollege protrade circle jerk as well if you look on personal finance and college debt one of the top comments will be to forget about college and get a trade all without context as to the persons preference for their life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive seen a lot more comments about trade jobs than stem jobs recently always accompanied by stem jobs suk comments whatever stem jerk there was has been replaced by everyone just get a trade job jerk neither is good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it comes from being put down as a nerd and then going into a program that has a huge payoff gets our dicks hard but we still nerdy weird ass mfs at heart
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cpa here the whole economy is heading in that direction tho you will need to be able to learn complex things quickly if you want to succeed in tomorrow economy investing in the trades isnt nearly as secure as stems because it teaches you that skill i mean shit even im learning computer programming because you never know when an entire industry will be automated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are we not calling trade schools college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think what they meant was you have to start as a laboror thats usually how it goes in the trades you start at bottom but even that is well above minimum wage then with time experience promotions and new certifications your pay steadily increases im all about trades my husband makes an hour as a trackman railroad job and he started in december each year as his seniority in the union grows he will make more money and be afforded more vacation time as of now he has a week of vacation and full benefits for us and our daughter i just rambled oops sorry i just cant say enough good about trades not for everyone but its a great option for some people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know what the situation is in freedomland but here in canada the unionized welders labourers and drillers in my company get paid around cost to the company taxes benefits etc is just over the real money in trades comes with overtime some union agreements give timeandahalf hourly after the first hours in the day and double time hourly after hours in the day and on weekends guys who chase the overtime work can make well over six figures its one of the biggest things they neglected to tell you in highschool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean its not a shit ton but depending on where you live you can definitely live fairly comfortably on that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i made as a boilmaker helper literally no training or experience whatsoever thats quite a bit compared to retailfood service jobs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a year right out of high school sounds like a god send
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol and the watch in this pic costs more than that edit rg ap royal oak
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not the base wage that makes them money its all overtime hours and risk addons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,depends on where you live really my father does stone masonry and he makes an hour up north but down south its like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,starting position is decent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,especially since minimum wage is being raised to some places
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this describes a buddy of mine although sometimes when the shit literally hits the fan he says he wishes he woulda became an electrician instead lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what apprentices and labourers are for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really i know some guys making at least an hour who work on cars maybe its an area thing did you not go the apprentice route
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most trades require a few years of working while also going to school to get your journeyman status a lot of schools require you to be currently employed in the trade and also a registered apprentice to even take the courses you cant be an apprentice unless a company agrees to take on as one in the first place there are preapprenticeship courses you can take but they are usually just a waste of money they dont guarantee you a job and youre likely going to start as a laborerhelper exactly like somebody who is green and didnt even take the course all the course does is teach you the basics youd learn from doing the grunt work anyway that might very from trade to trade but i know its how electrical and welding work also it might vary from the area youre in too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah these kinds of things can only really happen if you have inherited money even if you did work your ass off to get a job at a top hedge fund you probably still wouldnt spend money on things like that for a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres just as many guys who are doing fine with this type of work into their as there are banged up dudes technology has made a lot of the work easier and safer too not to mention some trades are usually a lot easier than others too theres also cushy industry and management jobs too that a lot of the older guys take as well shit even the your own small business route too its honestly not that bad at all but thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe its because college or mcdonalds is all theyve ever been told and theyre rebelling against it or maybe romanticizing the working class too bit of both probably
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,congrats and great work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,alot of overtime im a union crane operator in texas we get paid really well and we work alot of hr weeks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably a welder or oil worker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yah he saved up enough to get a working albeit shitty water plane and got a handful of well paying contracts and went on from there last i checked it was him and a couple more pilots with large planes doing runs almost daily
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,username checks out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you know you know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,labia majora
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you joke but that watch is standard issue in moscow upper middle class families
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why should i need taste when i can post pics of dom perignon and hennessey talking about my non existent millionaire lifestyle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or i could pay my student loan 😢
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in fact forget the dom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yes it used to be a bottle before caittier struck the deal with jay its even nonvintage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never tried it personally but from what ive read its not horrible just overpriced sort of like beats by dre it really only got popular cause jayz got pissed at cristal lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah jay started promoting it because cristal basically asked that he stop namechecking them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is average
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah like is goodish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no not the new sat its out of i literally took it a month ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im in the midwest and all we ever had granted this was over years ago now was the act which was something like a max score of i think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit thats right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gpa is pretty far below mediocre
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like if you inherit money you also inherit higher expectations most of the people i know that came from money dont mess around even if they spend their weekends drinking and smoking they still have solid grades and plenty of work experience even if all of them were from their parents and their connections
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats reasonable
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no you wont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that makes me sick the whole i just went through my friends list if you see this you made the cut bitch youre just asking for attention shut the fuck up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they hate us cause they aint us
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you have to cut the grass for your snake to show theres definitely some kind of problem
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah if youve got a ton of money from your parents most year olds dont have that kind of capital
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not a bad option but it would be better to fix them up and record the process with a camera crew for some nice hgtv income
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,passive income my butt unless you want to pay someone else to manage the property carry out light maintenance and hire workmen for the heavierskilled work owning a rental property is time consuming af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the year old with the unique business idea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,capital gains tax tho which can be avoided by living on your property for a couple years ill let him do all the house buying
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,itd be better without knowing the market economics theres no way you can say that there is a point where selling makes more sense than renting out its not hard to calculate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,assuming you have unlimited capitol but if you have that its best to just buy apartment blocks or hotels have to start someplace and flipping is a good way to make up some capitol while being in the game
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,better to airbnb or vacation home it nowadays you make way more money and people only use your house to sleep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a lot of people have a plan b aborishade said i dont really believe in plan bs i believe that if you have a goal go at it as hard as you can once youve done everything you possibly can to reach that plan a even if it doesnt work out the way you want to then you move on to another plan a what a legend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rnottheonion right there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he doesnt have a plan b get ready for the child support payments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,abiola aborishade thats straight out of key and peele god damn
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is great on so many levels
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no he went to dartmouth at least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my state we have schools for national accreditation to become a personal trainer for i think you just have to take the classes look moderately in shape and then try to get clients i see some successful weightlifting personal trainers that look super small their clients are usually inexperienced women that also just want to be small so i guess theyre at their desired fitness level its just kind of silly to sign up for a weightlifting class and then get there to find out you squat more than them already and have equally average form
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,now hes trying to become a personal trainer when he himself pops xans and percs constantly this sounds exactly like someone i know but with meth and coke instead he said he rarely gets any business but when he does he charges an hour he even said he has no idea why someone would pay him an hour
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,becoming a pt is easy af its making any money at it where you get into trouble i tried it last summer made a lot of mistakes and gave it up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah bobby
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only ever see the crowd with this as their occupation on facebook
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its enough to get a sweet pad in peg city but youre going to go broke spending the rest on booze to survive the bitter cold or swarms of insects in the summer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,outsmoked and outplayed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i know what you mean who doesnt want to flaunt once in a while you know even if you are financially responsible its just the ones who show off often are the ones who are usually irresponsible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there is definitely nothing wrong with living with your parents for awhile you knew that you were living at your dads house rent free so you helped around the house in return like you mentioned you also had a job too so its not like you were freeloading some people live with their parents and dont work for shit their parents basically take care of them which is a shame
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do something to fix that man you only got one go around dont spend it unhappy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you are body wraps slimming miracle weight loss wrap your body and sweat for an hour and watch your weight drop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats impressive for me now but a highschooler serving could easily make that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hi mrs pancakes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also there are all these young people really pushing for people to go into trades if you talk to older people who have done a trade their whole life most of them tell you to go to college so you dont have to work like they did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair when college costs plus interest and apprenticeships actually earn you money pf isnt going to have much of a debate about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for every circle jerk there is an equal but opposite circle jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,someday in the future the reddit circle jerk will tell people to be artists and poets and writers and on that day ill be a happy man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats because a bunch of morons went and got stem degrees and cant find jobs because they have no skills or experience getting a cs degree and just skating by and not doing internships is a shitty decision so those losers just assume its stems fault rather than their own laziness
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stemtrade job any day if you can actually succeed in stem but if you cant a trade job is a pretty good option thats the thing not everybody can get a stem job but a lot more people could probably learn a trade
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the trades thing is because its election season and politicians always go into trades jobs are important theyre a good way to make a decent living but i think part of it is that they want to appeal to the working class
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but stem jobs best jobs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the annoying thing with me is ive found very few engineering students actually passionate or even interested in what they are doing the engineering students that are actually interested in what they are doing are cool to talk to the other ones usually arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeh i started working at ups while i was in college and even the part time benefits were damn good compared to what my fellow students were making now im a driver making a good wage most people dont know that these unionized blue collar jobs pay really good money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is awesome and should be taught to high schoolers not everyone is made for college and its ok everyones i different with different talents and dreams but the message is if you dont go to college youll end up at mc donalds yeah go ahead and sign this debt dont worry once you finish college youll make millions more people should look into these jobs and they should be supported for doing so not chastised
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one week of vacation is that normal in the states i work a basic government office job in the uk and have days to use with the option of extra days flexi leave that sounds kinda ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not in tristate area though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for like a year until you realize how expensive it is not to live at your parents house
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah the watch in the picture seems to have different hands than the one you mentioned maybe just a knock off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is a technition i am a fast lube tech i was told that fast lube was where everyone starts yet a month later a younger guy with less experience and no degree got an apprenticship makin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new york russian not moscow russian guess i forget we can be a bit different
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im years into repayment of a very modest loan i see kids dropping and higher to attend public university i want to scream from the rooftops no go to community college first for two years unless you get a scholarship or your parents are paying cc also offers financial aid you can work part time and actually pay your fees while living at home it was not as glamorous as the dorm lives of my friends but i only owe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck i forgot to pay mine thanks op for reminding me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt most champagne nonvintage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anything above a now is decent isnt goodish its actually more like percentile
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,back to two sections
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the new sat is composed of two sections the math section and the readingwriting section each out of with a minimum of so the total score range is from before march of this year the sat had sections each out of so the max score was a but they changed it back to which is what the scoring was out of back in the olden days as part of a redesign to make the sat more like the act luckily i took the sat before the redesign so i dont have to worry about this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for some reason i thought act used to be out of and they changed it to but now i cant find any references to it being out of who lied to me as a kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats when you reply oh whoops i missed you and unfriend them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,smh whenever i see that sort of shit i just delete them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you just fucked sean parker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they hate us cuz they anus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,things are not always as they look like im soon finishing school have in cash a car on my and just applied for a that is i dont have a license and the car broke down summer job so i can buy stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or construction knowledge of how to fix houses up to increase market value for that matter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all you need is a small loan of one million dollars
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know why but i secretly feel like all those guys are secretly getting fucked by hgtv somehow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the reason renting is nice is because you can mitigate the cost of the property and just sit on it until its value goes up youre not actually turning a profit on the rental unless youre factoring it all into the total profit from selling the house
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my uncle owns a bunch of properties hes a plumber does light maintenance every now and then isnt a big deal the biggest hurdle is collecting rent but if you have a property manager then you dont have to deal with that shit directly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,totally agree i am in the middle of trying to sell most of my rental properties luckily for me i bought most when the real estate was way down and the market where i am is red hot right now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but close enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,long term vs short term
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe he is in vancouver or san francisco
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rgetmotivated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,xmus jaxon flaxonwaxon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i knew an abiola in high school she was actually african so its apparently a real name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats umass at dartmouth not dartmouth college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,umass dartmouth is worlds different than dartmouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i feel that but itd be hard for me to trust a personal trainer that is years old and a benzoopiate fiend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont have to be jacked to be a personal trainer you only need to know what youre doing of course with all sales businesses maintaining clients is of the job whereas actually knowing what youre doing is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least the dude you know acknowledges he has no business doing what hes doing lol this guy thinks hes straight up god sent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,congratulations you outsmoked yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah thanks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what the drugs are for
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah yeah if they were making bank on tips that could happen would be a sweet gig though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plus the fact that the trades fucking eat bodies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you can go to college for a hell of a lot less than
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unidans first law of reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,newtons first law of dank memes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,similarly every subreddit in a state of circle jerk tends to remain in that state of circle jerk unless acted upon by an external circle jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there doesnt seem to be an equal and opposite circle jerk of bernie sanders
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get whatever job or career works for you trying to shoehorn yourself into a trade is just as bad as shoehorning yourself into stem i dont want to go into a trade because i know id hate it so even if the pay is good it isnt for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,most of my friends are engineers and they were always making cool fucking shit in college wood burning engines formula cars etc and now most of them have half a machine shop in their garages and do that for fun those dudes love tools and making shit and arent nerdy at all but maybe its because were all hicks and pretty outgoing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theres an unfortunate stigma against not going to college its sad because the colleges are raking in the cash and getting ahead while some of their students who shouldnt have been there in the first place graduate confused jobless and in debt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive been thinking about going there i know you have to start in the warehouse and whatnot but would you say its worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,usually they have flexible hours for a student too one of my friends was a delivery guy for fedex and he loved it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,absolutely there arent as many of these types of jobs in america like there used to be and thats part of the problem too but were always going to need plumbers electricians etc there is work out there in the trades and yeah my husband was a terrible student his older brother was deployed in the iraq war while my husband was in high school and unfortunately his brother was his only good influence when he left my husband starting doing drugs and dropped out of school no one stopped him from doing that he eventually got his ged but everyone assumed his future was bleak however he knew some stuff about masonry from his father when we got clean from drugs and alcohol he started working as a mason learned a ton from that company and that job opened his path into the railroad union its amazing oh and did i mention we both have a pention because of this job its simply amazing there are other options besides college for those who feel they fell between the cracks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,debt people are in the hundreds of thousands these days for school and even with high paying jobs they wont be paying it off until theyre at least some may never pay it off if thats not fucked up and a deal with the devil i dont know what is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel bad for the american working class im just a lowly electricians apprentice and get vacation days a year
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which three states i can think of about or so that are attached to other pairs of states
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,theyre making way more than in the nydc area
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but you also dont have in student loans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no there are dozens of variations and customizations you can get through ap add offshore to what i said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that sucks man if i was you id start checking other shops for work or an apprenticeship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im also judging by the gwagon similarly standard issue to kids in these families
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i went to a public school for years and owe about the same as you a month
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats crazy for you people in the states a public university is a year in canada same in ireland when i was living there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but theyre charging like it is people are ridiculous
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not the good stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you need like a out of for high tier colleges so thats what i was going off of yeah is good enough for state schools and what not but it wont get you a ton of scholarships
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that really i got which was of my graduating class i feel like lots of people get
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is percentile solid but so many people dont know what their doing or shouldnt be taking it it pads the stats i got a score around that but didnt feel like it shouldve been that good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got a its about percentile i think could be good enough for top schools if you have a lot of other things going for you but for the average student itll probably land you somewhere between a midtier school and cornell if youre going for broke
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep math and english
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was very clear and concise thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just took this test in march and theres also an optional essay you get graded from three times on it each grade is something different i believe one is comprehension but i forget the others
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bingo you cant win oh wait you can jist delete facebook and move on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no but he is selling sean parker dildos that are pretty amazing although if you really want to make money you should sign on and refer some friends so they can sell for you its time to wake up people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont scroll without typing amen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cuz they ate anus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plus side is you know how to cite your shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hate when the care breaks down
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,references check out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo i love me some noneu currency the hungarian forint is the fucking best i had the best time of my life in budapest cheers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hgtv was set up to increase loantraffic for house flippers shady business
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,werent those twin brothers just actors so they scooped them up for that house flipping show definitely shady shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah they arent getting fucked they arent even using their own money these days give someone and act like their realtorcontractor and boom you got yourself a show they also seem to totally under state costs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still hours is a pretty good improvement from the usual even if the work is marginally harder sounds like a good gig
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hrs a day aint bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hours per week for properties seems really high dude probably hates his family and is working at a strip club or some shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anyone looking for actual motivation rgetthefuckoffreddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hukalakanaka hakanakaheekaluckahukahakafaka
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah me too not to throw any shade at trainers but they really dont do much that you cant do by yourself though i guess its more so for people that dont have the time to research this stuff for themselves or gullibly follow fad diets get no results and then feel like they need the trainer to make progress
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats true fam but it helps sell the point that you know what youre talking about if you look like you live for what you preach if youre trying to sell a home to a couple you wouldnt show them a model home that had shit on the walls and cement in the toilet salesmanship is a lot about the face too first impressions car dealerships put their sexy cars in the front of the lot restaurants put their desserts in a cooler up by the front door sometimes you get the picture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and souls dont forget souls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and yet many somehow spend anyways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit i forgot about unidan is he still on reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rthedonald
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah im just saying the whole stem vs trade thing is stupid because the two arent really related most people who fit into stem dont fit into a trade and vise versa i think that stem has more perks to it than most other degrees and trade jobs just because of how useful the skills are and if you can succeed in high level mathematics you can pretty much succeed in any of the other stem categories its just not everybody has the brainpowerdedication to learn those skills and those skills are so valuable that you can make bank pretty much anywhere with them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you dont plan on doing college go for it its tough though weather can be a bitch some days your truck will be completely full higher seniority guys will take you off routes they like etc but the pay helps make up for it once youre at max pay youll probably average around a year i dont plan on sticking around cause its seriously taxing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,california florida and maine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,please let me clarify tristate area being the large umbrella around nyc with high cost of living especially nj in general
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the hell is nydc area those are not the same area and there are multiple states in between each other
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i agree but my comment is in reference to someone saying is a comfortable wage to live on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eh oh well that is an ugly watch i get it if you want a rolex patek omega because those are more or less timeless looks but this not so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was offered an apprenticship with one more dollar per hour at another shop but they drug tested so naturally i went with the other and newer dealership i have no doubts that once i brig my framed degree into the office ill be moved into the shop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id judge but i really want one probably for different reasons it looks pretty spacious and could go well for a road trip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you explain to me why vintaged champagne is better than nonvintage also it seems youre suggesting that nonvintage champagne isnt good stuff when the vast majority of all champagnes are nonvintage including some that ive enjoyed like montaudon mailly dom veuve and tsarine edit well i goofed and dom is only vintage but i believe all the others arent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea is the magic number for scholarships but in general most kids dont go for ivy league schools so really is good for most
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you toss out all the sat scores of people who are not going to college and were forced to take the test for whatever reason then the average gets a lot higher lot of really really low scores weighing down the average like there are people i know who went into the sat put their name down and then answered like questions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well statistically most people did not get a lot of my friends did because thats just who i hang out with but in a general consensus anything over is pretty good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,technically a citation comes after a period
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nobody cars what you think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,put some respek on that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hours a week just to pay for the house though depending where you live thats pretty high i dont think many places have more than of your income going to just housing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,good trainers do a lot for you thats why pretty much every professional athlete still has trainers someone who just lazily goes through a workout routine with you is a bad trainer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive had a trainer that was an olympic lifter and taught me so much about form i couldve never hoped to have learned by myself he was to this date the only good trainer i have seen in my hr fitness though everyone else is exactly as you describe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think so his username is unidanx or something like that i dont think he posts very often though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not really sure where to go since college doesnt seem like its meant for me where are you going from there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just like shitting on the city people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the really low profile ap royal oak is about the most beautiful watch that was ever made the offshore is a gaudy mess by the ss royal oak in beautiful not to mention ap has been around quite a while longer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i meant judging to mean deciding that its russia the cars great i have one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because its vintage duhh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dom is vintage only
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but those are a bunch of vintage champagnes or a mix especially dom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,champagne is living and maintained bottles are hand turned until sold it tastes better over time like whiskey and some years are notable because of the weather experienced that year lots of time and effort go into those vintage bottles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just saying sounds more like it would be than or theres a pretty big dropoff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they eat the poo poo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,noh ees a seekniss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,knew there was gonna be one guy lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was a carless thing to say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,come to vancouver where everyone is stupid and lives outside their means i know plenty of people who pay out close to of their income nd thats just for rent not even owning
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i get it now misunderstood the first time reading it also that last sentence applies to lots of big cities now unfortunately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah i see i misunderstood i guess that works if youre planning for a future generation of your family etc
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh yeah i meant as supplemental income in addition to said gas jockey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,see thats how trainers should be theres one trainer i see around my gym that looks like he knows what hes talking about but unfortunately the only people that pay for trainers near me are year old girls and middle aged women that only do leg days and some body weight ab work so i cant really tell the depth of his knowledge i get you dont really have to be big to know what youre talking about but if helps sell your knowledge if you look like you live for what you preach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh really its on my list of dream cars along with the jeep wagoneer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in my experience the rich high school offered a afternoon weekend summer sat prep class its gossip but some of their student athletes allegedly paid people to get a fake id and take the sat for them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah at my school a act sat was considered the cutoff for being good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea you are right i was exaggerating a lil bit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they stick di hand in di anus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this guy walks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats what the are doing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how much at the prices theyd probably want itd make more sense to just study
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,zero fucks given by adams damn shame he couldnt make it to the finals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trying to sleep with a puppy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was pretty fucked up how many fouls green gets away with though its borderline useless arguing with the refs green tried to take adams to the floor and submit him but only a common foul was called
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did i turn the stove off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that face on the right has next big meme written all over it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when he realized the nba is rigged
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did i feed the cat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were these by accident
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is my life now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol first pic his arms are like that persian room guardian cat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when the curse of lil b hits you in the nuts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,were these by accident
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dat nut shot tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i went to an all white school in elementary this is way more appropriate for growingupblack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,green got the rko tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure the conversation had was eh i would call that but fuck it dude has a pornstache anyway fair enough
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when you realize your life is shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga look like an undercover miami narcotics officer from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mad respect to the guy for keeping his cool i dont possess a of the selfcontrol and composure that guy has
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,me accurately right now and if you him off the bed you feel like satan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats because he didnt get to the ropes in time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,double foul was called too this series was tainted by green playing like an unlikeable john cena
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope double foul was called even worse rofl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wrong tried to break his arm and they call a double foul on both you know cause adams was trying to hurt green with intent the bullshit bush league acts draymond gets away with is mind boggling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but will it overtake spongegar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this wouldve been a much better title
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,highly doubt it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,looks like he got a charlie brown run up to that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes and playing for the warriors his life sounds pretty great tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ron artests career lasted longer than a decade though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he has one violent series and suddenly hes laimbeer to everyone lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol green is not going to flame out of the league you might hate him but frankly thats a ridiculous comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ron made a lot of money a championship and was a core player i would way rather have ron career
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude played years you sure you know what you are talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no fucking way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seems as though the humor was lost i was just commenting on his facial expression not saying that his life is actual shit because aside from these pics he has a comfortable life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean meta world war
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but the justice is that everyone will remember green as a psycho and not a champion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because if im being paid millions to win nba titles and beat people up im really gonna be the type to give a fuck about what people think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh not everyone can be a hero right now green is lookin like rodman to stephs mj and klays pippen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you dont have to be a hero to not kick a dude in his nuts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,talking all that truth talking all that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mick jenkins gettin love when you least suspect it 👏
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like ppl slept on the waterswell not everyone in this thread at least yall woke 👌👌👌
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just listen instead of focusing on defending yourself listen to what shes saying youre not always right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mick jenkins goat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i found him on my discovery playlist on spotify recently
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,neither is she though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,once she go black you dont get yo hearing back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and hispanic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,selective hearing only hear what what you want 👌🏾
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if she is trying to explain why shes upset with you just listen and take her in and dont shut down if somebody tells you you hurt them and theyre upset with you you dont get to say nuh uh i didnt hurt you youre wrong just take them in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats assuming theres a good reason why shes upset everyone gets upset over stupid things sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and you think dismissing them and shutting it down as opposed to listening is going to make that better all ive been saying from jump is just listen to what the person has to say instead of shutting down because communication and active listening are more helpful for both of you in the long run you dont get to decide somebodys feelings and nobody wants to be dismissed and ignored your best bet is making a person feel heard and acknowledging how they feel and then trying to address it rather than being obstinate
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you make it sound like every argument is neglect lol its not even that serious sometimes calm down dr phill
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every argument is somebody not feeling heard or acknowledged you wouldnt be arguing otherwise its not even about neglect man this is just basic shit so both of you will be happy im calm fam disagreement doesnt mean anger i just think listening is important for a nontoxic relationship
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a generalization arguments have an incredible amount of variables and happen for more than not being heard or acknowledged im not suffering from chronic arguing i was just making a point that its not always so simple
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you felt like the other party was acknowledging you understanding where you were coming from and listening to your point why would you argue if you felt like you were being heard why would you fight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,difference of opinions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh huh and what are you doing when you have different opinions trying to convince the other person because you think they arent listening to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or just trying to argue your point across with what your morals and beliefs are unless you both agree on everything there will be an argument saying just listen and understand their point of view is irrelevant because you can know someones point of view still disagree and continue to try and sway their opinion just as they can do the same to you agree to disagree is the last statement made in an argument not the first one an argument will take place to reach that conclusion

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow i didnt know that chuck didnt have cornrows its a conspiracy erneh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wha all black people dont look alike
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at the upper face though eyes and cheekbones are very similar along with a seemingly small mouth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i didnt use quotes tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nah dont quote if you aint gonna quote the wire shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do black people like the office i was always under the impression that they didnt if so this means that i share one more thing in common with black peoples besides big bootys and cream soda
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn can you believe this buffoon first he jams his orange foot firmly in his mouth and then he continues to see how far he can swallow it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that looks more like house of cards to me especially in the context what did i tell you he is fucking it up himself i dont even have to do anything
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we love the office
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its one of my favorite shows of all time absolutely love the office fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game subtle fire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that house in the background look like the damn ghetto to you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even got the ghetto emojis to go with it smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no trees grass or cars in the ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lack of bench press in the yard indicates this aint in the ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,both cars look old as shit and you cant see enough of the house to say it doesnt look ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh how can a emoji be ghetto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those aint even very nice cars one of thems a fucking pt cruiser
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do people do that is there not enough space in the house or the garage do they just want girls to be mirin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gmoji
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol look at that low quality mess thats how
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not exactly sure im from australia and ive never seen it personally i just see it in a lot of movies and think its kinda funny wont lie though the city i live in is pretty much as ghetto as it gets here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its like that in the rez too trust me probably just because it feels good outside and you can throw the weights around without worrying about damaging the floors like youd have to inside
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,adelaide
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope ipswich its a decent sized city just outside of brisbane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahahahaha yep ipswich could charitably be described as a ghetto could be worse could live in wacol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahahahahahahhaha wait thats not funny im so sorry whats it like living in the ghetto town of queensland
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk what it is about south east queensland b but everywhere is hood af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean there isnt street gangs and shit but a couple of my homies have had people try to jump them at night and there is definitely social issues that go unreported in the media but you know that stuff is rampant here stuff like meth and heroin addiction and poverty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lived in robina place is dope
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats everywhere of people have no idea how to correctly and safely operate a vehicle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,florida drivers will speed up so you cant get in the lane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or you know just everywhere because people suck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not just california
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a lane thats untouchable like elliot ness
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well after reading the comments its become obvious to me that bad cali drivers have spread across the united states and we must begin a purge immediately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think the real question is which state has the nicest drivers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no idea how people who throw shade at ny are going to incorporate the subway tims and bmy guy into this but i look forward to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im actually very fond of this title
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you obviously have never been to virginia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,way more of a problem in socal than the bay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is the most accurate depiction of this meme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol come to houston if you want any idea of shitty driving
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a state thats untouchable like elliot ness the track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats in miami times worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,iowa isnt so bad the cedar valley area has a bunch of dicks that havent heard the word from our lord and savior turn signal but there isnt really a lot of traffic overall so you can get where you need to be pretty easily as long as youre not in downtown des moines
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the turn signal is basically an alarm the notifies other drivers to speed up and not let you switch lanes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my route to work involves going onto the motorway from the sliproad and having to cross two lanes to get into the only lane going to a certain route the distance between the sliproad and the other route exit is about metres i dont even understand how this is even a legal design its so dangerous and then when your trying to get across people race up the right hand lane stopping you from entering it and then when they get in front of you they cross back into the lane your in to take the other exit what the fuck
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit its true if you are trying to pass me you better fucking hit that pedal to the floor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you ever been to atlanta
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,texas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do people speed up anyway when they see someone trying to get ver are they really risking a car crash to be somewhere like seconds faster
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can anyone tell me what this meme is called
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bruh cali drivers are the most passive aggressive drivers ive ever seen they literally think turn signal means speed up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,itt every state has bad drivers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the rule is when driving in la if you use your blinker no one will let you over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,california makes up for it by having so many cool cars
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nebraskans be pretty chill compared to these other places
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no one gets the reference
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not cal is bad the bay is worse and so cal is trash garbage seems to get worse the more south you go
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that an series
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing in mass so it perpetuates the cycle of not signaling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,florida drivers will speed up so you cant get in the lane
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i live in california this is true but i will tell you why because for every cars you let in one jackass will get in front of you and drive slower than the speed of traffic here in california the speed limit is but the fast lane usually maintains a mph range there is nothing more infuriating than letting someone in and they decide that is a good place to reset the speed of the entire lane also prius i will never let a prius in front of me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,am florida driver near ft lauderdale can confirm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and in arizona
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and in houston
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,omfg seriously i was in a double turn lane going left and of course the right lane the one i was in ended almost immediately not one fucking person in the left lane let me in i ended up stopped at the side of the road waiting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not in colorado besides the occasional asshole people drive relatively well here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing in louisiana whyyyyy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and in new york
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same thing in utah people like to do their best gandalf impersonations when you try and switch lanes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i think it may happen everywhere but while i drive with a mowing trailer people automatically have this thought that they cant be stuck behind me ive never had to use my car horn so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck yeah i just moved here about a month ago florida drivers are fucking assholes im at the point that i just switched lanes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same in california
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they do that in iowa also i just get over anywaythey slow the fuck down you have to to it to someone with a newish car though also i only do it when im alone never with my family in the car
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it feels like it happens more on my motorcycle times when i should check even if i dont plan on changing lanes the car will pull up next to me to prevent me from getting over e does bpt hate bikes or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they really should look into a recall because there are just way too many vehicles that dont have working turn signals or they ran out of blinker fluid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the lane hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,vermont
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,minnesota
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kentucky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new jersey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ayyy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,swva is very pleasant for drivers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,from nova sometimes when im in a merge in lane some dickhead will speed up right when the lane is very close to running out forcing me to be behind them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mfw when white people are racist lol am i doin it rite guys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i let the lambos slide because those things in traffic are a biiiiitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that a real news website why did they write a report on a scripted video as if it were real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imagine being able to travel at ludicrous speeds because no one has to assert dominance on the road
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that south trip from slc to vegas is not something i would miss if self driving cars were a thing lol plus it would make utah roads safer these people are damn maniacs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,selfdriving cars would be great if they could actually be guaranteed to be safe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i still signal just that quick second signal before i turn thats what the polite drivers in h town does
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its always some asshole trying to get in at the last minute before an off ramp or trying to wedge in between you and the person in front of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,prius this is so fucking true im from nc and went to cali this summer for vacation and i have never seen so many prius in my entire life especially on the highways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,truth i live in a heavily asian populated area and they all drive at least under the speed limit and dont know the traffic laws its fucking infuriating
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk ive recently driven in arizona in a road trip to the grand canyon along and there were some of the most courteous drivers ive come across
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you do get people from nebraska there so youre bound to run into at least a few assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same if i try to change lanes some jerk will speed up to block me and do that thing where they pretend not to see you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you mean headlight fluid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a damn lie minnesota drivers are assholes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,foh where u live were assholes sourcebeen all over jersey worst drivers than in philly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but why go there foamhenge moved
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rt fuck the and the altogether
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the sun is like the onion in a sense because it is mainly devoted to publishing satire problem is it doesnt know it publishes satire
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the sun is a notorious tabloid news company here in the uk its one of those ones youd see walking into a petrol station and the cover says shocking i didnt realise my baby sitter was fucking my dad with red everywhere to draw attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they are safe they just keep getting into crashes with dumbass real drivers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,member checking in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no in htown we swerve across lanes and the solid striped area to make the exit in time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf id rather deal with an asshole who can drive than someone using their blinker and zero assertiveness some people will put on their blinker and just hang out waiting for a huge gap holding up the entire lane of traffic behind them at a certain point you gotta make some moves and stop waiting on a written permission slip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i just drove from el paso to flagstaff today and it happened at an absurd frequency on from tucson onwards
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretending not to see a motorcycle is just as bad as actually not seeing them smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no those are just for the front lights blinker fluid is yellow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,s
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shoutout to the trucks that show up on exclusively for my drive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,coors light is just perrier for poor people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,assertiveness in a car you dumb motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tucson is where the shit hits the road
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its worse
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true but id rather not have people drinking it before they drive
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah you need to balance driving defensively with a little offensive driving to get anywhere in some places motherfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the supersuckers make tuscon out to be the worlds biggest trailer park ive always believed them and tuscon has never tried to deny it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,agreed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah assholes on the road are worse than the oblivious ones i got hit by a car on my last bike and the dude didnt wanna pay for it it was a two lane road with traffic coming in both directions and he pulls out and blocks both lanes thankfully the driver behind me saw it and the incoming driver was a traffic cop
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some people will put on their blinker and just hang out waiting for a huge gap holding up the entire lane of traffic behind them give me a scenario where this is actually a real problem whether the traffic is moving or is stopandgo car a is signaling to let car b know of its intention to get into lane b and instead of being assertive car a is waiting literally seconds to ensure car b is aware of its intention when car a finally switches lanes all cars in both lanes either in moving traffic regain their speed and catch up with the flow ahead of them or in stopandgo traffic they move forward before they have to come to a stop if in any of these scenarios time is loss all cars will ultimately catch up with traffic rendering that time loss absolutely no significance it takes only a single little offensive driving where shit hits the fan for someone to end up hurt or dead and the only anywhere theyll go is the grave for what its worth im typing this with full awareness that im just talking and you refusing to accept any piece of advice because youre ego is going to prevent you from doing so thats how debates go people argue and shout but minds are usually never changed hopefully when you learn this lesson on your own it isnt at the cost of a life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im talking about people who come to a near stop to get over a lane cause they dont have the aptitude to judge the movement of traffic or their surroundings and merge in of what i meant does having his blinker on make him not a complete idiot drivers who are inexperienced or lack confidence on the road can be just as dangerous as assholes since they are often poorly reactive or cannot process whats going on and their own driving at the same time you are taking my words assertive and the idea of being on the offensive a little to mean reckless which is not what i meant at all maybe thats a failure on my part with the explanation end of things but i dont know why you pulled the mature debate card or accuse me of being stubborn when youre the one who started off with name calling hopefully the video helps you understand where im coming from not my footage but i see that kind of shit all the time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should have remembered you security questions whats the color of the second shirt you wore in grade

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i looked it up because i was curious based on httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofpresidentsoftheunitedstateswithfacialhair id say its not too uncommon about a quarter i think that less of a quarter of the men i see daily have facial hair the reason why it varies is probably because having facial hair goes in and out of style very often
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kim juan un
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hmm on that list it seems theyre older times think about who was the last president that had facial hair im guessing theo roosevelt perhaps its not the clean look of a president not to mention that most presidents are lack of beards

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hi thanks for submitting to rblackpeopletwitter however your submission has been removed this action was taken because wtf if you disagree with this action you can please include a link to your post so that we can see it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,our power rangers teamed up with tmnt foh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo i ran into the red and black ranger once at a club and drank with them for about an hour nothing like getting drunk with your childhood
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,threaten to bust out your dragon flute and dragonzord his ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ill slap that fucking kid outta this planet the way rita gets bitch slapped in the movie if yall saw it yall know what im talkin about that was some shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look im just glad they had the balls to give the female ranger proper armor tits nobody had any illusions about what was under that shit but they tried to make it all ambiguous less with pink than yellow tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah back when the rangers were racially typecasted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deadass you will never be flamed harder than a table filled with middle schoolers kids be going for peoples souls yo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they should have used the suits from the first mmpr movie not these alien glitter suits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo know he jerks it to the new pink ranger like we did to the older pink ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the old ones look gay the new ones look gay when you got a rainbow of spandex suits with masks that have lips built in theyre gonna look a bit gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should beat that child
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well one of our rangers was legit gay so hes kinda got a point
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a lot of shows were low key gay back in the day
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shouldve stone cold stunnered his ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,christ look at the tits on yellow ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,jokes on him back in our day trump wasnt the president kids win
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no he was right those guys were gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still havent seen it yet if i like power rangers as a kid will it be worth my money
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,all the deleted comments in this thread smh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shouldve told him only the blue one was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,come on billy doesnt need any more of that shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean lets be honest the power rangers of our childhood would be a parody equivalent today
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gay does not mean the gay you think or did it start that way gay now means lame twenty years ago meaning you like the same sex fifty years ago meaning happy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but the new ones literally have a gay character
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,had a group of middle school boys ride by my house on their bikes they yelled out that my house was gay i was so astounded i still have no clue what to think
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not that there is anything wrong with that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats with the ridiculous boob armour on the new yellow one that shit will get you killed direct all the force into your sternum retarded costume design
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we need a show about the ginyu force
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you old is using gay as an insult you are probably a bad parent or your year old has older siblings
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahahaha these kids now adays man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i really want one of the suits from the new movie but theyre probably like
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whatever at least my halloween costume was legit if that kid gets one now itll be some shitty plastic garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does he know that when you were his age you had to watch tv shows at a specific time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the difference is that western pr is shit now but super sentai zyuranger gets better and better with age
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes not wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kid aint wrong
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but the kids telling the truth as much as i loved the original rangers them niggas looked hella gay jumping around in spandex
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your son is wise beyond his years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in all fairness zordon was known to pal around with robert mapplethorpe and experiment at studio im impressed your kid is so knowledgeable of homoerotic photography but the internet has expanded the minds of many
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we i grew up on power rangers spd as it had the best zoid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for every year of the twenty first century the age at which these bastard kids are becoming more bastardly decreases results have been shown to be significant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that shit was gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,title game lit and should get more attention
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure i said that about them too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wasnt this just up yesterday or two days ago we just upvote blatant reposts now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,our power rangers look how old school batman looks compared to ben afflecks or christian bales
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the boob looks weird as hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the word hes looking for is practical
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,power rangers have always been fucking terrible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well to be honest one of them really was gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the beginning its like in idiocracy unaware of what year it was joe wandered the streets desperate for help but the english language had deteriorated into a hybrid of hillbilly valleygirl innercity slang and various grunts joe was able to understand them but when he spoke in an ordinary voice he sounded pompous and faggy to them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont worry gang youre all gay to me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if this was my child they would be in the backyard digging a grave for themselveswouldnt follow through with it but its a good way to send a message
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i watched it at that age too i was surprised that the pink one was a girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kill him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they were technically more gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boobs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least the modern yellow ranger is played by a girl
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tbf the new ones arent so hot either
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gregory alexander ugraysonalexander hmm
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey son i got you a new toy remember that cool power rangers movie we went to see son opens package only to see old school mmpr toy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they were high five to your daughter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yellow ranger in the show was actually a guy in a yellow morph suit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,insulting the original power rangers id smack that year old and kick his ass down the stairs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they do looks like a pack of asians in onesies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ask your son does your red ranger have roid rage and an obsession with becoming jose canseco
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,there aint nothing gay about kimberly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah well fuck you too you little shit classic power rangers are bad as fuck boiiiiii if you couldntve guessed there are a few playgrounds that im not wlcome around anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair the new movie was trash af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,with the turtle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he shoulda said to him like dave chappelle fuck you son
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what if current power rangers and tmnt crossover in a movie then what
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which red and black ranger fam
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got an autograph from zordon at a convention it was not very fulfilling
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i found out the day afterwards that some friends had met the green ranger jason david frank in a bar in my town i have never forgiven them for not calling me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my math teacher in high school had the same real name as blue ranger and always got asked about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so weird that the yellow ranger was male in the japanese version but america was just fuck it no skirt for you anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the way the others come in is oddly satisfying how quick they come in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,original yellow ranger actress passed away a while ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he picks that shit up from his environment just like you probably did
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know its offensive today but back in that was the goto insult at my school
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because his dad was a gay power ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol i was talking my neighbors kid once and he called his sister a bald headed slut nigga kid was like my friend wanted to tell his parents i was like nah dont snitch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or theyre wholesomely saying they look like lgbt mascots those outfits are kinda gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean im not going to pretend i dont know exactly what hes talking about
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because they did kinda look gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,askin the real questions
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why do you assume he is using it as an insult theyre basically dressed as the gay pride flag
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well they look gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember when i was around or maybe even younger i was taking a bath with my cousin and he touched my peepee and i called him gay and to get away from me he starts crying and my uncle comes in and asks whats wrong which i then defend myself and said he pulled on my pee pee so i called him gay my uncle grabs my arm pulls me out the tub and screams at me in front of my whole family with just a towel around me he is screaming at me saying what does gay mean tell me what gay means which i respond i dont knowcryingalso i actually didnt know what gay actually meant at the time i just somehow knew subconsciously which he responded with dont ever say gay again in this household and you better never say anymore words you dont know the meaning of so i kinda knew what gay meant around that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my year old just learned what gay was a couple years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought this was fading out years ago i cant really think of many places you could say this where you wouldnt be considered an asshole now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because its a popular insult that gets good results
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how do we know he meant it as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this never actually happened my friend
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was calling kids fag in elementary school
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,who said it was an insult the kid could be going as pink ranger to the next pride parade
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,seriously wtf thats what stood out to me this kid is four isnt in school and is using gay as in insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,knew this was gonna be the top comment before i even clicked
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gay is an insult until grade where every guy becomes gayer than most gay men
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the truthful answer to this question is in reality people use bad words all the time they are not meant to offend the gay population unfortunately were in a liberal renaissance and gay people are the most protected minority in america right now a four year old hasnt seen how fucked up backwards and soft society is right now so hes simply using a word that has a meaning to him and hes communicating effectively for instance i have reddish hair people use derogatory terms in regards to that all the time same as fat people dumb people crazy people etc the difference is im not a complete little fucking pussy out to change everyones behavior to make it exactly how i want it the rangers on the left look gay af
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new rangers didnt have the balls to keep the asian ranger yellow and the black ranger black
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually itd make more sense for her to not have armor like that since it makes the chest area a weak point in the armor its literally just done for yay tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,technically speaking its an awful awful choice it severely reduces the effectiveness of the armour deflecting attacks straight into her chest its utterly retarded if they want to create a badass female power ranger they should write a badass female character not slap these dumbass armoured tits on it grinds my gears
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,preach
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are they not in the new movie i havent kept up on it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomhgyktikjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the suits looked good in motion in the movie but man its hard to take them in at a glance in any still photos too much going on in the design i think simple is better and the movie did a good job of beefing those suits up while keeping their simple color patterns plus the themes were far more recognizable as their dinosaurs back then i think if the new helmets had that the suits would overall be better
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when you were
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the new ones look gay i think at least one of the new ones is gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,beat the gay out of him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,agreed especially if he talk shit on tommy pull out my dragon flute on his ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,which one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah did you ever watch barney
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you are probably really white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i thought so back then too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit yeah that movie had no right being as good as it was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gay has meant lame for at least years of course depending on the context it can still mean all three things that gay gay dude sure is gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so did the old ones billy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to be fair there was never a power rangers movie or tv show that wasnt absolute trash
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the movie was dope i dont know what youre on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sista turtle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had to google her why does she have tits turtles are reptiles
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,get that claw outa here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thank you for this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you get garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would see that the new rangers movie was good the turtles movies were almost acceptable but got the team itself perfectly it could work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit my bad austin st john and walter jones the only reason i got my attention towards them is because they had deep roy who played the oompa loopa in charlie and the chocolate factory with them we all drank and talked i offered deep roy a drink but he said he cant let me do that because his drink is they were pretty nice the black ranger seemed like he didnt want to be bothered though lol still let me get a pic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,by odins beard thats my line
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well all the scenes were taken from the japanese show what were they gonna do digitally edit that shit in
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,technically all the actors in the suits are dudes at least way back then i think it was only on the early where they got female stunt persons on the female suits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pink ranger almost fell over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my friends neighbour has a yr old daughter shes been sent home multiple times from daycare because shes said are you fucking kidding me guess what moms favourite saying is to daddy who is useless sack
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont swear in my fuckin house man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but at four
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a questionable environment then
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you start school at age anything before that is your fault
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey imma have to ask you to keep the savageness at a low okay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yup gotta hit them with the classic ask them if theyre gay then follow with does your momma know youre gay works every time 👌
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah midlate that was to go to for anything we didnt like literally none of us even really thought about what we were saying it was just the cool insult to use it took longer than id like to admit for me and my friends to get it completely out of our vocabulary i still sometimes almost let it slip around close freinds we said it that much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same or being called fruitcup or gaybob
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was offensive then too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bet you werent using it at years old though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i remember the first time i got called a faggot i was like am i a faggot i dont know what that means
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scared for a sec
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but not when we were maybe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lul you mean offensive on tumblr hahaa
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new boots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sooooooooo fucking embarrassing we need to kidnap them give them the michael jackson treatment and take their blackness away they cant be fucking up the brand like that my question is why the fuck are they lingering there they know they arent wanted and whenever you arent wanted somewhere things get drastically worse when you stick around and of course once she gets bucked down by the taser now folks want to show up and intervene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn his babies right there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn wonder who downvoted this smart kid
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your uncle sounds like a cunt tbh pretty big overreaction
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit youtube the internet middle school high school college also probably wherever you were years ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its still the default insult in gaming culture that and a lot of mom fucking
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its still going strong in poor neighborhoodsghettosbarrios and rural areas you peeps should leave the nice areas once in a while
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same and i really regret not understanding the full consequences of using hate speech im also disappointed in my family for encouraging that type of behavior when i was young
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my brother used to call people a teamkilling fag if you did something to upset him call of duty is great for kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people in my university use it too the gym tends to attract dudes with the most homophobic vocabulary possible ive seen my bro get called a faggot as he was working out with his girlfriend but none of us honestly care and mark davis can go fuck himself al wouldnt allow this shit to happen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did it ever occur u that he made this situation up for retweets and likes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people just equate tumblr with anything nowadays
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol being called a ginger isnt the same as using gay as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,basically how saban made the show for so cheap all the action scenes were just dubbed from super sentai so all they had to shoot were the scenes of the rangers hanging around in street clothes also saban supposedly treated everybody like shit and payed them pennies but thats incidental side note apparently that all culminated when the blue ranger david yost left the show mid filming because of incessant homophobic slurs from the crew supposedly the only people who were supportive of him were the other actors this article huffpo sums it up well take note of them being paid as much as a fastfood drive through worker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rip trini
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,owo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive never noticed that pink had a skirt and yellow didnt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nice
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i aint watching it then thats the whole reason ilowkey loved power rangers cuz of my niggah black ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn thats a good point burn the witch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its so stupid how you have to side step things now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,even though its not a big detail tit armor drives me insane like how the hell am i supposed to believe youre going to last in a fight when a single trip will smash your sternum to shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its alien biomechanical armor manifested through willpower i dont think titty weaknesses were their main concern
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,umthenyay tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did you see the film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,only the pink one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the new ones arent very iconic they remind me of the new shitty transformers looks overdesigned or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they were the best so fucking awesome gives me chills when i think about the time that i watched the mmpr movie in the cinema
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mouth outside of white looks comical though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta start some time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and the sad thing is hes still the least gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trini is the gay one now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean if a gay is inside the obvious thing to do is to beat him out of it or just pull him off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,must be a republican
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont nobody clown on my man tommy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the first blue one i think the reason he left was because he was harassed about it so much
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what did he say
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the actor was gay not the character
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whos that the one with the baby blue bandana
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tits are awesome ninja turtles are awesome qed ninja turtles are tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,turtles also arent bipedal use weaponry or speak english
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same reason people give robots tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fingers too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because they are turtlehuman mutant hybrids did you even watch the damn show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the last tmnt movie wasnt that bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,exploding garbage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the hell is he drinking that is in a club
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still let me get a pic you cant then not show us the pic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kind of irrelevant but theres a pretty good story about austin st john eating shit on a backflip in front of a group of middle school students buried somewhere in the my brother my brother and me podcast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that episode is excellent edit to be fair curb is excellent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive got like a inch bunch up over here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually its mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know maybe have american stunt doubles perform those sc never mind cheap ass saban
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe make the yellow ranger a dude in the american version too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its now ruined thank you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no youre gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gayer than dudes fucking dudes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how gay was it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pause
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your typo made me read that last sentence in a russian accent
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should take over move in kick him out eat the children and have your own lion king
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,shit balls
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how does stuff like this seem to exist at very elementary school we didnt even know how to use the computers when i was in elementary
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,or pile driver them and whisper its all about the game and how you play it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yep same with faggot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was just a dumb word thrown around to more or less say man you are being a sissy because idk stereotypically speaking gay men are more fabulous and less manly not always the case but who cares stereotypes are funny when you dont base youre life off them by either being offended or by thinking they are true and a way of life
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of course its offensive thats why they call it insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gaywad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah it was but nobody told kids any better back then it took me a long time to stop saying it and i still catch myself saying retarded sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you sound gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no youre just a pussy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i call bullshit on this post four year old wouldnt even know the concept of gay as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea ok kid says one inappropriate thing and hes destined to be a delinquent when he grows up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao really why is every event that happened ever a huge moral event for some people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont talk about kidnapping kids and giving them the micheal jackson treatment in the same sentence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im betting at least his uncle is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think so but you can never really know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id say a lot of people think youre an asshole for saying that in high school and especially college
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,reddit youtube middle school awful lot of crossover in those populations im betting as for college unless youre living with a bunch of bros i dont think theres many circumstances where this kind of thing flies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im from a rural area so unfortunately im familiar i think you just hit on one of the many reasons people choose to flee these places if they can edit theres a reason these places are considered dumpy dont try to pretend theyre authentic somehow
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,really regret what you were years old of course you said dumb shit thats like regretting shitting yourself when you were
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its really fucking interesting to think about how times change and how slurs as insults are affected though may be a bit too drunk but its hella cool how our insults transform thru the years
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gay people are called fags because they were burnt on those sticks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,al would have done this move in a second he thrown a toddler off a bridge for a new stadium
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,people would never do that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah because red heads arent a bunch of bitches looking for social protection from insult ginger is derogatory anyway you slice it even if its just the delivery of the word ive heard it a million times its not up to others to determine whats too derogatory and whats not too derogatory the difference is you havent been blasted by social awareness programs stating having red hair is the same as having black hair and needs to be accepted as such or else
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they ran the blue ranger off the show for being gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i fuckin never knew this and i dont know how i feel about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait so along with the homophobia and underpaying what else did saban do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its a traptrini
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real i found out a few years ago and was likesad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whats this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure thats why i liked yellow and disliked pink tomboy was life until i got pubes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the blue ranger black actor is the best though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hip hop kido
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why would they make them color coded with their suits anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,side step dressing up minorities in costumes that match the color of their skin lmao wtf dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i totally feel you its like bikini armor you wanna sexualize someone fine but at least make it make sense on the battlefield dude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rarmoredwomen
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im just pointing out that literally the only reason armor in general looks like that is so the actresses boobs can be emphasized and it goes against logical armor
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no does she die because of her shitty armour design does it come up is it mentioned is it rectified
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,racially typecasted white actress pink ranger uh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,rather billy the blue ranger is black zack the black ranger is asian trini the yellow ranger is hispanic kimberly the pink ranger is white indian and white jason the red ranger is white edit kimberly is part indian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imo the problem is the helmets the original helmets were all really distinct but the movie ones dont have much variation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,unless youre on pornhub then they have other ways
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,p h r a s i n g h r a s i n g
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck up and catch an ass beating like goldar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should read this niggas other comments thats what im talmbout black excellence ladies get you a man like this you know this brother had good parents gotta get me one like that 😤😤 thats what im talmbout talmbout yo umglln give this nigga a really white tag
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,some wall of text about how he would beat the ass of whoever says the original power rangers are gay using a fuck ton of words associated with black people like yall and nigga if i remember correctly
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,venus
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had never heard of the female tmnt until now so i searched around then fell into a deviant art hole of tmnt rule sometimes i hate the internet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,qed goes at the end
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wasnt good either lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk lol i was just like okay i was so drunk at one point i was like dude i was the red ranger for halloween and my brother was the black ranger when were kids then to deep roy i was like tell me about johnny depp and chris pine hes also the little alien that follows simon pegg around in all three star trek movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at a club in nyc a shot of ice water
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,super premium shelf stuff think johnny walker blue label or remy martin louis xiii my old club featured a bunch of shit like this including a bottle of macallan which was an ounce theres even higher priced stuff too and precisely none of it is worth it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it was the series premiere i believe im so happy that show is coming back
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in later seasons the american crew did a lot more filming for fight scenes some episodes have hardly any japanese footage in the later later series they finally stopped having different genders leading to a season with only one female ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats not my name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no youre the puppet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i got two dads who are both fabulous meanwhile your basicass mom is like a bottom that cant host i saw how sad your birthday party was
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gaygay gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i know you are but what am i
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uruguay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gayer than a rainbow with a handbag
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,useless sack is sack with no potato
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,carl jungs theory of a collective unconscious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,older brothers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i only say that in my own company when im road raging or something i wouldnt say it in front of others
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,id say it was mainly thrown around in the midlate because a lot of people think theres something wrong with being gay and thus itd be insulting not necessarily stereotypes but mostly homophobia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,offensive to the gay people being compared to your dumb ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you know what he meant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,preceded by gaylord
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,queer bait
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the event this guy is talking about is the textbook example of what people in child care would call a teachable moment normalizing this type of behavior is the reason its such a problem today
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its reddit so yep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,god thank you for making my day better with this comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i bet they encouraged the shitting too those bigots
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they were always slurs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,imagine if people called each other black as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,umi dont think it goes as far as setting back gay rights but imagine youre a little gay kid who doesnt feel exactly like the other boys and knows something is different you arent sure if you want to tell anyone and then you hear the other boys running around using the words gay and fag to insult each other and the kid being insulted gets offended or pissed that shows you as a gay kid that nobody wants to be gay or be associated with anything gay thats a self esteem crusher and when youre that young and impressionable that can cause for big problems
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,literally just updated the post with that wanted a source before adding that tidbit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont know how i feel about it dont feel about it its fucked up but it was so long ago it falls into the meh category nbsp in a high school freshman wore her new white gap jeans to school on that day not only did her period hit she also had food poising from the night before thus staining both sides of her jeans she was made fun of and tormented for the next years how do you feel about that probably nothing because while it sucked it was ultimately inconsequential
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well saban was supposed to do business with gene simmons and kiss but that fell through when saban and ari arad started to talk in hebrew thinking that gene simmons had no idea what they were talking about until he answered back saying asshole im one of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if you think that weeb emoticon is hard to decipher wait until you see this tt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he fr was the best
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well it is a show about bringing different colors together
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not advocating to intentionally color code them im just saying its sad and fucking stupid that the pendulum swung so far the other way the black guy cant be the black ranger or people will be offended
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fine but at least make it make sense on the battlefield dude well it appears to be fucking magical techno armor with a galaxy inside it rather than just a sheet of metal so theres that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just give them a skirtkilt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i love that literally the second post there is the pink power ranger with armor that has a proper chest piece
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i subscribed to that a long time ago nothing is sexier than armor plating
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you should work for bioware
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how about you see the movie and inform yourself before making claims thats just a thought and if you wanna complain about spending money to see it watch it online did you really just try and back up a point without even actually watching the film in the first place thats still happening in jesus christ
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude youre actually pretty funny you sound like a friend of mine
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uh what pink rangers have predominantly been white girls is white not a race anymore
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guys im green falcon
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is there a whitegreen ranger in the reboot tommy was the man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure the new pink ranger is indian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the actress that plays the pink ranger is mixed indian and white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,they have the same names
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i believe the kimberly is indianugandan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wasnt trini hawaiian in the movie i thought it was mentioned her last name is kwan she definitely wasnt hispanic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pft nothing makes sense these days
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,absolutely i dislike that i cant see much of any reference to the animalzord the rangers pilot in the i loved how the fangs of the yellowrangers and tusk of the blackrangers helmets reach over their visors its such a nice detail
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im pretty sure goldar is the evolved form of moon moon what a dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you cant quit youre fired
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats a wrap
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,like the other guy said talmbout is accepted nomenclature but im still in favour of the really white tag
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck you mean you must not have grown up in a lower class hood talmbout is actually very common lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty sure yall isnt associated with black people its a southern thing but thanks for letting me know
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i have no idea what youre talking about that never happened there was no fifth ninja turtle there was no last airbender movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,goes at the end qed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,actually it was surprisingly good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,deep roy is in a lot more stuff including the hobbit movies it must be weird to have your acting talent just be being short and yet be successful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was any of you the white power ranger
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,blue label doubles are about around there dude must be drinking some year balvenie or something to get that price for a drink
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lordy you just compared a bottle to a bottle i could understand them having blue but i feel like the xiii is way too expensive for a bar scene
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,huh it actually was i thought it was early season but not exactly that one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your name is snowball
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stacy aka hell
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre not my dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clap clap thats not my name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh god its spreading
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe idk i was a young kid and or a teen when id throw it around and i know i never had any actually hate in my blood when i used it it was just a playful jab at my friends its weird how things have changed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as a dumb person i take offense to this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its an insult not because theres a problem with being gay but because someone is calling you something that youre not
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was the cunt insult when i was like lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yw
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its possible for gay people to have kids
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well yea im in no way disputing that rather im remarking on how some slurs are phased out as insults as society changes instead of being the goto insult they instead change to being taboo in many instances regardless its cool as hell to observe
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can confirm im not black but i am gay and elementary school insults helped push me deeper into the closet when the thought that you arent normal gets ingrained into your head as a young kid the psychological effects can be really detrimental
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah but i have no emotional attachment to said freshman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lol damn thats a situation ive always wanted to be in someone talking shit in spanish and then i pop in like check yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats actually hysterical i wonder if they didnt think he was jewish or if they didnt think he spoke hebrew
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no man thats the next line that follows that emot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dressing up people in suits that match their skin color is progressive thats like saying the holocaust was about uniting one group of people in one place and since when was power rangers about bringing different races together i dont recall that ever even being a message they just did that shit like school textbook photos with groups of people the only thing pr was missing was the disabled kid in the wheelchair
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ah yeah i see where youre coming from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,having seen some of andromedas writing im sure i couldve had a positive contribution there lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that wasnt exactly what i meant
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you think i named myself black vulcan hell no i used to go by supervolt black vulcan was aquamans idea and i said well maybe we should just call you white fish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,got teased nothing shown though rita had a green coin though like how the others had their respectively colored coins
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the internet rumor mill wants the green ranger to be a girl honestly given the self referential jokes in the movie they just did im on board with this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in the show in real life he was an mma fighter and jerk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,naomi scott is a product of the entire damn british empire but yes mostly indian
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,those are the only names with attitude
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its possible i was going off the actors themselves not so much what was referenced in the movie
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit yeah never looked at them up close without knowing of the original series you couldnt possibly figure out that theyre based on animals just by looking at them
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well you get my point at least
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still waiting on indiana jones and a live action dragonball
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tits
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck you son
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomisjehzsjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because my fur is pretty and white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah thats pretty gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what a gay name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because he snowballs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,love ur name
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wheres hugh honey
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like im shopping at an american eagle in here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,during the mid to late also i dont think its weird that things have changed from it being okay to use someones sexuality as an insult to not being cool now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont worry youre also gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,because no one could feel empathy for a group theyre not a part of right
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,found the dumbass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats a very optimistic outlook on why the word gay is used as an insult
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not that theyre giving you shit for being something youre not its that theyre giving you shit mark slc punk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,right like youd be just as offended if someone said you have blue hair when you really dont totally the same thing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dressing up people in suits that match their skin color is progressive its a kids show thats like saying the halocaust was about uniting one group of people in one place im sure you could make a kids show about the holocaust and make it about uniting a group of people in one place without getting into the politics and since when was power rangers about bringing different races together subliminal messaging yes it is real
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the day things are truly better is the day where nobody even notices coincidences like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah clearly pink white but the girly girl princess and love interest of any group in moviesshows is almost always white
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,in the sequel that im confident the new film will get im fairly certain theyll have tommy find the green coin from rita and struggle to control the power it gives him turning him into a temporary villain maybe with zedd serving as the primary one that comes in later on also i would recommend anyone to see the new film its not incredible but theres definitely heart and care coming from every angle of the production the acting is great and the action will give anyone who liked the original a nostalgia overload its definitely not a transformers level remake
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,interesting because they already name dropped tommy oliver in the movie so either thats just a smokescreen and theyre gonna make a new character that becomes the greenwhite ranger or theyre going with tomi oliver
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah just funny because i usually think of white hicks saying it not black people
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,live action dragonball oh man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,scrubs season as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eragon was just a book series mario is just a video game series forever more
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,live action dragonball what are you talking about there httpsenwikipediaorgwikidragonballthemagicbegins httpsenwikipediaorgwikidragonballssaworasongokuigyeorasongoku i remember because i caught a few minutes of the magic begins on tv like years back but it was on the spanish language channel so i didnt stick around for very long of course an official hollywoodproduced dragon ball movie would be great no way they could fuck that up
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,eat shit and die goatfucker
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,look at opover here delivering and shit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is that discount wayne brady
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh shit unzips
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where are my testicles summer
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hey thanks man
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude eat my boogers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i was born in so yeah mid and late would be when i used it idk being gay is something i cant relate to so i cant say if someone has a right to be offense by it or not i only know i dont have any outright hate towards homosexuals
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,time for the moderate intelligence bisexuals to take over
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre on a subreddit called blackpeopletwitter
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao i dunno why youre getting downvoted so much i dont think youre actually calling him a dumbass are you it seems to me like you just used the same joke format he did since the options were really gay dumbass he already picked gay and you picked dumbass thats just how the joke ends up trying to explain that shit i feel like im going to get a bunch of responses from people who didnt get your joke are taking me super literally
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well its used as an insult by people that genuinely dislike gays too but you dont have to be homophobic to be offended by someone childishly calling you gay
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am though shocking i know but its sincerely interesting to me as a history major to observe these changes i really didnt mean any disrespect if i came off this way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,meh i wouldnt act like white guys are the only stereotype who uses this kind of language
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you hook me up with whatever retarded ass shit youre smoking what the fuck youve gotta be trolling right its s kids show so its okay to do hilariously racist shit were the straight up jigaboo crows in dumbo okay because its a kids movie and wtf re holocaust kids show i never said you couldnt make a progressive or positive story about it why are you even using that as an argument lets look at so its not bad because you can make a happy story using it as a setting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,while i agree that was the that was purposeful as fuck lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,true i didnt think of it like that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,idk if you know this but theyre planning more movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was pleasantly surprised by the acting in the film and attempting to put my childhood bias aside i think it was an objectively good film
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,maybe tammy was misspelled
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,how dare you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga please super mario was so bad it was good like the ninja turtles movies
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httpiimgurcomphecwnkjpg
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,delivering
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that is one good lookin dude at first i thought he was the guy in the right and was very disappointed but after googling to confirm that beard is doing a lot of the work
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whoa cannot unsee he looks great though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fair enough i wasnt trying to say that everyone who uses the word gay as an insult is homophobic just that it definitely originated from solid homophobia i mean it caught on eventually and everyone was using it constantly so it just became the go to insult to use without much thought behind it i just assumed that it became popular during the not sooner but im also not that old so i wouldnt know that well i am gay so i do find it kind of offensive when people say it i dont think anyones a complete homophobe when someone uses it as an insult but it does irk me and kind of makes me go really dude thats not cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,never thought my time would come but here it is hold onto your hats boys
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the mib
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it seems to me like you just used the same joke format he did since the options were really gay dumbass he already picked gay and you picked dumbass thats just how the joke ends up this actually is why i downvoted its too reddit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,kids have no fucking clue what racism is they dont see yellow girl in yellow costume as racist they see it as fitting shes representing yellow youre retarded if you think kids are reading into the show that fucking far and btw i only mentioned holocaust because you did pay attention to your own damn comments
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yea but now its the and its some dudes job to make sure nothing can possibly be construed as racism happens even by coincidence or it will be taken out of context and theyll be crucified for it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i would like to meet famous people as well can we hang out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,stop being so damn cool god dammit
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah when op makes an outlandish claim and then follows through with proof
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,average bisexuals on the cutting edge of mediocre unite
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,andor girls heshe is coming for you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well i feel like youre in the minority or maybe rblackpeopletwitter is just an entirely different animal but i feel like if everyone saw it the way you do then he would not be at nearly a hundred downvotes for a bad joke maybe around at most like booo this guy but at yall are all goin fuck this guy in particular
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude kids dont even associate asians with the colour yellow to begin with
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dude just wut yeah i brought up the holocaust im not knocking you for mentioning it im knocking you for the argument you presented where tf did you get i was commenting about you using it also sooooo because kids dont fully grasp racism we should just have racist shit in their shows wut why not teach kids about racial disparity instead speaking of reading your own comments youre the one that mentioned subliminal messaging so all of a sudden that doesnt apply to having not so subtle racist shit in kids shows but when youre arguing that its subliminal messaging because theyre working together then it applies all of a sudden
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just because the kids dont know what racism is doesnt make it not racist and doesnt make it ok to expose them to said racism
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,so who would be the modern side chick for obama its costumary for evry president to have at least one side hoe

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,your sacrifice serves the greater good fambruhgini
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i am your wife im the greatest good you ever gonna get
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,why is this chick retweetin herself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,uk gov ok fine well put it to a vote uk people leave uk gov fete cyah rassssssssclot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holy shit im loving this influx of ukeuropean memes lately
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sad ting eh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can someone explain this drake and ting meme like the song being referenced or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gyalchester is in britain though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i laughed real hard at this then felt sad at how much i actually miss manchester after fucking escaping from longsight after years proper sadting
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its took me a mad minute of thinking to figure out the game uno had nothing to do with this
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same reason you keep your comment upvote when you comment
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,same reason one likes their own posts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,gotta believe in yourself
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,claat
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dissenters we should have another referendum since both scotland and northern ireland voted in so lets be sure by giving a chance to people who didnt vote last time uk gov nigga fuck yo shit activate article fiddy now fam editgrammar
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ting just means thing here in uk instead of saying madting you might say something like crazy stuff
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and britain is now no longer in the eu so were stuck there
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i always downvoted mine right after dont want to come off too cocky
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the fk are you even on about do you know how a democracy even works should there be a re vote every election because a bunch of people voted for the other candidate and some people didnt vote
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,also toronto and london slang are remarkably similar so its not like drake bit this from the uk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,where yall at
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im dead as fuck that this at points
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,both have heavy jamaican influences thats why
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its lowkey crazy how influential jamaica is to global culture
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,post the uks two most important western trade partners where newfoundlandthe maritimes and jamaica a ship might bring manufactured goods to jamaica and load sugar rum or molasses then go to newfoundland and load cod then back to england and so on up until jamaica kinda faded from the picture this is why newfies like cheap rum called screech and the uk traditionally eats tinned fish at tea its also why youll find more linguistic cross pollination than with say haiti or something
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and so many people dont realise it they just think its weed and bob marley
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fun fact the biggest linguistic influence in jamaican and many other caribbean dialects is irish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fun fact reggae was born out of a government programme
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,global i think you mean the western world
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its almost as if black people decide whats cool in most western nations
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dont underestimate the fake patois
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,weed has been apart many cultures and civilizations since ancient times b jamaica didnt do shit for it still a dope place tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,can you expound im curious
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,guess you havent been to japan lately theres a huge subculture into jamaican dancehall music
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wait why you say so i know nothing on weed history
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not really good at explaining this stuff but shows a bit more of the irish influence when he speaks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ya got any proof to go with that exaggerated claim
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sure do my good friend below youll find a couple links that will illustrate the developing subculture to japan and dancehall reggae here is a vibe magazine article that talks about a sound system sound system is what you would describe here in the us as a dj so picture funkmaster flex but like less bombs dropped and more airhorns incidentally the airhorn sound so heavily incorporated in music today was originated in the parties bashments in jamaica called mighty crown here is a youtube documentary about reggae in japan discussing the history of reggaes growing fandom in yokihama and other cities in japan it also displays some of their version of japanese dancehall which is actually pretty rhythmic it talks about the emerging scene in japan thats only about old kinda nsfw because of the display of how people dance which can be pretty sexually charged here is an article in the villiage voice discussing more of the reggae influence in japan and how much the scene has grown since our lord and master bob marley performed there in any google search for reggae japan will lead you to these links as well another good source i am jamaican i hope this helps my good sir now you got some reading and watching to do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,just got clapped back into the fuckin womb
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its mad when you go to parties here in jamaica and meet people from all over the world some of them dont speak english but speak patois just from spending time with the music
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,for real its almost surreal i went to stockholm sweden recently and they have a decent reggae scene out there also theres a yearly reggae festival in uppsala that attracts some good artists
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this honestly makes me angry
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,too bad she also thinks some melted cheese between a tortilla is a queshoedilla
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks op now im in the mood for horchata
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yo why isnt that a thing yet horchata with boba
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,low key peeping that jamaica 👀
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bone apple teeth
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its legitimately mexican not spanish people seem so averse to calling things from mexico mexican sometimes
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you yo can i get a cheese quesadilla everyone else so a quesadilla
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,of course he knows your mom gave him some of dat whorechacha last night
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,horchata is legit gross to me something about the taste is just off like milk pretending to be coconut water if that makes sense
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,horchata henny 🔥🔥🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,is this fucking chicha damn that makes me nostalgic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i could drink horchata forever
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,whorechacha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry meant to reply to the main
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is in la🙌🏽 also chamangos with boba 🔥
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,toe tap a flea
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,it is not it as absolutely spanish as in from spain and brought to the americas by them actually there used to be a similar drink with a similar name made all over southern europe with a similar name but they have diverged its actually made all over the latin america too but everyone uses a different base but they taste similar for example mexicans use rice rice however is not native to the americas and was brought by europeans along with this drink we latin americans have a bad habit of claiming stuff that actually originated in other countries
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,horchata is not mexican i dont know who told you that we drink it in puerto rico too we both got it from the spaniards
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ive had horchata in spain i should let them know its only for mexicans
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,los chilangos dicen que las quesadillas no llevan queso
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,quesaquesadilla please
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what the shit is chicha
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,no its horchata
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i need to go to cali
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thanks for explaining i had it sort of mixed up based on the rice recipe not really being natively spanish im just quick to do the gatekeeping cause it gets annoying hearing people talk about spanish chicks etc that are not actually spanish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahaha as a matter of fact it was mexican friends that told me that i stand corrected in colombia its marketed as a mexican thing tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i had pierogi in america shit we better call poland dumbass logic right here yall both stupid tho its not originally from either one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you could get a quesadilla there as well doesnt make it not a mexican dish
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a type of corn beer from the west of south america kinda tastes like kombucha if youve had that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except horchata originated there the difference is they use tiger nuts to make it thanks for being an asshole
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,spend literally two seconds googling where did horchata originate from
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqwheredidhorchataoriginatefrom
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,horchata isnt mexican tho the moors introduced it to spain so its north african
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ahh thanks for the explanation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,but kombucha is nasty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,central america as well
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lots of cultures independently developed their own type of horchata but the earliest known is from egypt the moors brought chufa and it is speculated horchata with them to valencia no chufa tiger nuts bitch no spanish style horchata the name we use for the beverage today is spanish yes but it is not exclusively from spain nor is it exclusively from mexico like the other dude said
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its from an entirely different spain than the one youre talking about its from a spain ruled by black arabs over a thousand years ago and several sources speculate they brought the beverage with them its known for sure that they brought the chufa aka tiger nuts
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wikipedia made you smart you still had a dumb ass counter bitch actually shit reread yours im the dumb one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😂😂😂 foh dude you said some dumb shit take the l maybe you shoulda spent more than literally two seconds googling where horchata originated

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,according to wikipedia lamars twitter account saw a increase in followers in the week following the tracks release while his wikipedia page garnered page views
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i respect you and birdman
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well first of all its just a fire verse secondly its a whole other thing when you call your contemporaries out by name declare yourself as a west coast rapper to be the king of new york and therefore the entire east coast even though youd essentially be saying the same thing by saying youre the king of rap in general but its just more personal when you explicitly claim a foreign region as your own imply that your contemporaries arent taking their craft seriously its one thing to say im the best rapper its another thing to say im the only true rapper its a bit more personalarrogant than the average im the best in the game verse also theres the fact that it came from kendrick lamar who is actually considered by many to be one the best rappers of his generation any rapper can say what kendrick did but only a few can say it and have it be true it stings more when you cant refute it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you forgot callin the nigga out on his own song lmao
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i find it funny how kdot did this n no one talkin about yh but sometimes i just wanna listen to mumble rappers n chill but cole does way less on everybody dies n yall go mad cos of the meme that his stans are extra just my cents they both good mcs
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,to argue your second point kendrick was quoting kurupt from the song get bizy by terrace martin
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,new york does not the east coast make
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,honestly i feel confident in saying that kendrick is one of if not the best rapper of his generation the only person is his equal is danny brown imo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as far as geographical importance in the rap community goes yeah it does what else is there baltimore new jersey philadelphia miami name the best rappers in the game right now from all those cities and see how they compare to ny those cities dont matter as much the same way seattle and portland dont matter as much as la on the west coast
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that you never even mentioned atlanta disgusts me you should be ashamed
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,well if were talking about east coast cities i didnt think itd be appropriate to bring up a city in the south 🙄
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its as east coast as miami and philadelphia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,miami sure philly no and no one except you has ever thought that in the history of ever

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i mean yungsnuggie is kinda known for being kind of reasonable often but he just makes an ass of himself a lot of the time either way hell be legendary imo for his rant against rtheredpill for their brigading of his comment in rnba
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,if anyone played themselves here it was me i outed myself on reddit because he texted me complaining about this post too and i was like that was me worth it tho
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,walks away to live in ohio
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,was it any good this fucking guy yknow i could kick youre ass you wonderfully ignorant fucker if it wasnt for my intense feeling of jealousy for you right now you get to experience the masterpiece that is john wick fresh all kidding aside the movie is fucking dope it builds upon the amazing and subtle world building of the first while not feeling like its trying to one up itself its action is a lot more intense and consistent through out and its third act is very strong in my opinion which is awesome cause thats where i felt the first one fell kinda flat all in all perfect score
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,caribbean card revoked big man am a girl lol see my mom grew up on the evap milk and tried to force it on us i would much rather the powdered dutch lady instead well tbh i actually hated tea when i was growing up so is only now i can drink it

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this tweet bumps in the whip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not if mariah carrey has anything to say about it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,isnt this just her second loss regardless of how bad it was surely looking from a long term perspective it isnt that bad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,not true just put my dog down a couple minutes ago
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,still got one more day left
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we still got hours left
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,definitely contender for post of the year in bpt
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,dead end hip hop on the comeup
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,mariah carey just slid one more into
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,between then and the start of ohio states offense died too
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes the old dude that doesnt like any new hip hop lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,does it bump in the whip
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we can all smell feefo through the camera cologne and swishers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she definitely doesnt have a big ego shes openly admitted considering suicide after she lost to holly holm you just need to exude confidence so your opponent doesnt get the better of you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth tyson im not buying it she seemed fine before she took that first l
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,after year in hiding she comes back for the championship title and loses in secs yeah im pretty sure shes done
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sorry for your loss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,w
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nigga so old he still waiting for the new sugarhill gang mixtape
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and you already know mykectown hated it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,cologne swishers and overpronunciation
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was nasty
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,that was beautiful
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,its not uncommon for people with huge egos narcissists for example to fall into a suicidal depression if theyre humiliated in a spectacular fashion ie one that even they cant twist in a way that feeds into their ego getting your shit unequivocally rocked in front of the entire world when youre supposedly the greatest fighter of all time will do that theyre so unaccustomed to the low when it finally happens they dont know how to handle it it literally seems like the end of the world to them not saying rouseys a narcissist but still she hasnt just lost these past two fights in close decisionsshes gotten beat the fuck down humiliated thats gotta weigh on you
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she has an ego the size of mayweathers honestly people give her a pass because shes a woman but she started the trash talking in that scenario
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you forgot to put jk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she was a sore loser after losing to holm rousey has the biggest ego
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,her dad committed suicide when she was young and she trains under a coach called edmund tarverdyan whos basically a laughingstock in the mma community her own mother former athlete says the guy is a joke but ronda wont leave possibly due to issues relating to her dad or some shit not even a fan of ronda but anyone who follows mma closely knows shes got legit issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sounds like you dont anything more than what youve seen of her in the media what an educated opinion
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,oh she hasnt done any matches since her first loss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she may never be back on top but doesnt she still have the option of fighting lesser fighters working her way up the ladder and rebuilding her credibility
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and then it clicked for me
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,tf even happened in the last one
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i knew she had real issues when i read about her kneeing her ex bf in the face and giving him a onetwo combo when he was blocking the door she said that she regret punching him because she would damage her fists and she had a fight later on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she trains under a coach called edmund tarverdyan whos basically a laughingstock in the mma community have you seen the videos of her shadow boxing its really quite sad
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,ok tons of pro athletes have that exact same background or worse and dont quit when they lose or get knocked out she enjoyed humiliating her opponents and what fighter wouldnt now that the tables are turned people are supposed to back off because she has issues
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,media im coming straight from the source rousey and alot of other fighters boxing or mma dont walk on eggshells they speak their minds all im saying is dont talk that grown up shit and then bail out on your mental health issues all im saying is where was all this talk while she was on top
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope she got real fucked up physicallyand mentally from the first loss
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,nope her career is gonna be remembered as being a great run in the beginning but going down in flames when she got exposed as not having any boxing skills
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,holly holmes broke her face it took months for that to heal and the next months were spent preparing for this fight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this was her last fight she was planning to focus on acting after this fight
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hahhaha this is so spot on
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hit the shut off switch
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,funny thing is the guy was the former champion of the division above andersons
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,something something if the roles were reversed that guy would be in jail for a decade
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,did i say she should back off no one user stated she has issues this a fact you stated im not buying it she absolutely has issues thats not debatable you can talk all the shit you want online idgaf but she has real mental issues that is all that i stated
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she has a vicious armbar and thats it one trick pony and she enjoyed her limelight now she gone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,im not saying that either but its still a shitty thing to do even considering that she had a shitty boyfriend especially since shes a professional fighter those fists can do damage
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,you right misunderstanding i meant that im not buying that as an excuse to feel bad for her
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,she has issues but any sympathy gets negated from her shitty attitude when she was winning for me anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,one nation one wall indivisible
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,boooooo
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,thats the jamie oliver face xd
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,aint no way a picture of adam devine is black or related to twitter

BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except this is a repost with the exact same title of another repost of this meme with a shitty title where someone in the comments said they should have titled it incognegro
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i was there for that
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damn it i knew it was too good to be true
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,wow could you imagine if obama had kids with three different mothers he would have been called all sorts of names
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and he gets upset if you roast him
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lets hope his twitter fingers dont turn into trigger fingers
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every time someone mentions donald is the president i get confused for a brief moment and have to remind myself he is indeed the president of the us i dont know if ill ever get used to it
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,at least he dont sing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,as long as the top keeps spinning we good
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i hope i wake up one morning to another executive order saying that weeds legal federally then i can just make these next years one large blur
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,plus he has a big fat thicc ass
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,loves too tweet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,pretty soon hell have a shitty soundcloud page
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,didnt start from the bottom now were here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,forget clinton and obama we know who the first black president really is
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,a twigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,we president now
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,clinton was the real first nigga prez edit yall are downvoting me but name another prez that got an oval office blowjob while he wife was down the hall
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,😂
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and you spell worse than him lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,romney was ridiculed for being very rich and saying the words binders full of women well we now have our first billionaire president and he literally admitted to sexual assault
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,implying trump doesnt get called all sorts of names lol
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,sensitive ass nigga
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i honestly wouldnt be surprised if he caused war through twitter hell probably be shittalking every leader out there in a couple of months
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,trump drakes biggest stan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every time i see him at the desk in the oval office it looks like hes filming for a tv show
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,what are you talking about were in a collective nightmare and obama is still president outside of this dream at least thats what i tell myself every night so i can sleep
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,on my local npr station a reporter accidentally said president obama signed an executive action referring to the ban its not just you thats having a hard time
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,lmao i feel you i think my mind subconsciously blocks it out its hard to accept
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,might not have to for toooo long i just pray that we never have to utter the words president mike pence
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,every morning when i have my echo read me the news and it starts off with president trump i physically roll my eyes and i never mean to its just automatic
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,the dude who helped kevin during christmas is now president kinda cool
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes the president not our president thats what threw me off anyway
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah i feel you as a year old obama has always been my president its all ive ever known and now it feels like a giant change that i always have to remind myself of
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and isnt telling people to peep his soundcloud
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,twitter niggas are not real niggas
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,repping the white delegation we are willing to trade for just about anyone
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,he is essentially the embodiment of what many black rappers rap about if donald trump were black people would be bragging about some of the same things he is ridiculed for js
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,come to oregon ill smoke you out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,do we have to notify your uncle
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,youre forgetting jfk he even took a bullet in the streets what they dont tell you is lee harveys motivation he was slamming marina oswald altfact
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,probably all of them he was just the only dummy to get caught plus what does that have to do with being black at all everybody gets bjs and everybody cheats why some people want to associate that with us and be proud of it is beyond me the real reason that saying was started was because he went on the arsenio hall show and played the sax and in general seemed to have some swag not because of the extra curriculars and in truth clinton was the worst president for black people single handedly did more damage than any of those republicans could have ever wished for he gets no love this way
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,my nigga just grabbing pussy oh its over for him called some hoodrat on the spot
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fragile narcisssist
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,couple of months his first tweet back from his selfimposed twitter jail was shit talking north korea into nuclear war dudes going all out
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i dont think the other world leaders are childish enough to engage him in his fuckery though
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,could you imagine if it wasnt even that like a war started and america was completely the victim some sort of pearl harbor shit i cant imagine what trump would do
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,and were in the trunk
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,yeah except its snl not the west wing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,fuck the infinite tsukuyomi went off
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,after the primaries my alarm was labeled donald trump might become president so i could panic attack myself into getting out of bed now i just have panic attacks
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i feel like i taking crazy pills everytime i think about it tbh
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bet
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,i cant stand trump i think he is a completely racist asshole who is tearing down the foundation of our country one civil right at a time i was simply referencing
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hes lightskin thats defines them completely
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,except like russia
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,hopefully naruto will stop flash backing so he can finish madara so my president isnt a childish cheeto
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,damnit madara it was supposed to be a dreamland not a nightmare
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,explain not a naruto fan
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is what i was waiting for im glad this comment is here
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,are these pills that make you crazy or pills that make you not crazy
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,when bill clinton was referred to as a black president it was in reference how he was being treated during his scandal
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,this is a good post and i dont know why youre getting downvoted
BlackPeopleTwitter,not_removed,bro bro im cool with jokes but what you said is just ignorant
