GetMotivated,removed,this is such bullshit im sorry you got guilded for this drivel wow lets talk about why your advice is so terrible were social animals and we need to be loved by others loving yourself is all you need is an empty platitude and dismisses people who are looking for love and cant find it loneliness has huge health ramifications and shortens your lifespan the person you responded to is in pain and you basically told him that pain doesnt matter he has a real problem and instead of pragmatic advice like ask what exactly what people find offputting about you or heres how i got out of the friendzone you gave him some vague and cloying diatribe about loving himself nice going

GetMotivated,removed,reading these comments makes me want to unsubscribe what a bunch of salty unmotivated group of people the comment section of this subreddit is its called rgetmotivated not rgetmoreexcusesformyself this isnt a place for the losers of the world to wallow together and bathe in mediocrity it should be a place where we help each other up and out of it fuck the comment section
GetMotivated,removed,or it could also mean your ass is where your face is supposed to be but thats ridiculous and we shouldnt say stupid shit that is irrelevant you are taking personal accomplishments and saying an individual is probably a fuckup elsewhere because of it take off ya hoser
GetMotivated,removed,yes that is what hes saying because thats how the world views fat slobs you know why because its true look at the obesity rates of the poor and uneducated
GetMotivated,removed,what a most generic and ignorant statement
GetMotivated,removed,a lot of work for the status symbol of douchebag i mean being fit and strong is greatbeing a roided out bodybuilder is fucking stupid
GetMotivated,removed,are your fucking kidding me with this shit you claimed to be a bodybuilder earlier like wtf please tell me you are a troll
GetMotivated,removed,from who other douchebags
GetMotivated,removed,to everybody posting that dumb study about how steroids and no working out produces better results than someone busting their as naturally i have this to say omfg will you pathetic fucks stop posting that god damn study every time someone says steroids is cheating that study is absurdly wrong plus it is interpreted incorrectly and incomplete first the notion that someone doing steroids and not working out would show the same progress as a natural bodybuilder working out days a week is fucking retarded i have been involved in fitness since i was years old i was a competitive powerlifter and later an amateur body builder i have trained natural for years at a time and i have used steroids for years at a time i know the how much of a difference it makes there is no way in hell that i could stop working out and be a couch potato while running steroids and keep up with me training naturally it is not fucking possible i know my body inside and out second that study only ran for weeks weeks is nothing weeks doesnt even give your body enough time to be adequately stimulated by the training protocols the majority of people with success in the gym achieved their success after years of training fucking years some people decades weeks tells you nothing third too many variables not accounted for what was their diets like how experienced were the lifters how was their rest were they taking any supplements that shit matters a lot one or two people loading up on carbs the day of the rep max is enough to skew the numbers off so badly that they would have to be thrown out forth sample size was pathetically small half of the people they started with fell out of the study for various reasons also some of the natural lifters got popped for steroids what other shit were the natural people taking fitness is not only my passion but my career and life i can tell you this from experience it is a known phenomenon in the industry that a lot of so called natural people love to take anything and everything under the sun if they think they can get away with it and still prop up their ego by claiming to be natural when they are so far from natural that they might as well just shoot steroids and get it over with unless you have trained for years and have some sort of understanding of anabolic compounds then stop posting this stupid shit its a lie it is bad science nothing replaces hard work nothing no you can not shoot up and then play wow for hours a day and expect to have a physique even remotely as good as the guy or girl busting their asses in the gym everyday on no steroids that study is just the battle cry of pathetic lazy fucks who need to grab a hold to anything they can to feel better about their poor physiques and poor self image
GetMotivated,removed,yeah weightlifting records without going into anymore detail set off alarm bells for me too had to check his post history after that ignorant post that clearly bogus claim is probably why he deleted all his comments lol
GetMotivated,removed,except you can inherit some great physiques through the genetic lottery no virtues needed
GetMotivated,removed,you are just some jackass on the internet why would i take your word for what your sister who totally exists did when it just happens to support you acting like a whiny brat i have scientific studies that support my position you dont
GetMotivated,removed,if i dont like it ill ignore it if they dont like as you may have guessed they can ignore it til i can just start being a douchebag because other people could just ignore me fuck them right
GetMotivated,removed,haha you fool you are the one throwing insults all i said was that you cannot assume someone who is active to be all the negative things you said self absorbed mid life crisis neglect etc youre tone just screams insecurity tell me again how cool you are it almost sounds like you are self absorbed oh wait your also mid life is this outburst a midlife crisis did you describe yourself in the original comment do you need to put down physically active people to feel more accepting of your own body i never called you lay i implied you were more lazy i guarantee there are tons of people who can claim all the same things you do but are also physically fit which makes you lazier by definition
GetMotivated,removed,mmmm donuts
GetMotivated,removed,how the fuck can anyone ever think this is true even for second its like youve never examined the world in the slightest sense this is mind blowing
GetMotivated,removed,something can be shallow without being problematic im not attracted to fat women is a shallow statement but its not a problematic statement
GetMotivated,removed,dude did helllllla roids and gay fucked his way to stardom fuck you reddit this is worse than facebook this is even worse than my dumbest facebook friends bullshit repost crap wow seriously done with reddit
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,wow what an ignorant comment the average person who has to force them self to workout sure maybe but a lot of people genuinely enjoy working out they genuinely enjoy being in shape and having more energy
GetMotivated,removed,it shows steroids
GetMotivated,removed,when i go to the gym i feel like some people stare at me all the time i have a beard when i dont wear contact lenses i wear nerdy glasses cause im half blind that make my eyes look tiny also i do some uncommon exercises like single dumbbell chest flypress with light ass weights even though im like fuck em im building my body not trying to lift heavy weights to impress some dumbass jocks and whenever i see someone trying to lift heavy with a weight they obviously cant handle of the guys i usually go lighter and focus more on the contraction my first though when i go to the gym my presence here is a fuck you to you people
GetMotivated,removed,are you in shape and do you have muscles you have no pics in you history bro only see your scrawny hand in one pic
GetMotivated,removed,chill out son working out isnt hard at all
GetMotivated,removed,thats why i love that nicole arbour video dear fat people sure its extremely insulting but if people care enough even with a medical condition they can make their health and weight better
GetMotivated,removed,well if youve ever ventured fitness forums and boards on sites like bodybuilding or youll notice the predominantly male users there regularly complain poke fun at and judge people for the silliest shit i have regular anxiety entering the gym and working out people will laugh at those who use machines of any sort complain that women only go to gyms for attention have seen this argument plenty and had a trainer who was making fun of the way people were working outsetsetc when i was being trained also arnold was a cheating piece of shit why are we worshipping him lmao
GetMotivated,removed,the commenters here are full of people who lack any sort of selfawareness i tried to point out how its shallow and not necessarily a problem nearly the same thing youre saying and got pushback for some reason as if thats relevant considering how deep the topic is and how negative scoring comments get autominimized he got quite a few upvotes
GetMotivated,removed,then a jealous skinnyfat neckbeard dismisses it with roid head
GetMotivated,removed,fucking idiots steroids dont give you a easy way to gain muscle youre still busting your ass every single fucking day to earn it you cant sit on your flat ass and type while on steroids to look shredded
GetMotivated,removed,lol sacrifices you must become a complete recluse in order to put on size sounds pretty fucking stupid
GetMotivated,removed,arnold is in a billion mentioning your scrub achievement is really offensive srs do you realize arnold is the faker of lol in terms of achievements are the local amateur teenagers who have lifted for years in a bodybuilding show
GetMotivated,removed,she has a fat ass no one would have any idea who she is without it no one would know her sisters etc she put her fat ass in the right place at the right time and the spotlight turned on her freakshow socialite family i dont know if thats success but shes not losing sleep over money
GetMotivated,removed,anyone have a tldr im too lazy to read all that
GetMotivated,removed,yeah fuck him fuckyourself
GetMotivated,removed,how so
GetMotivated,removed,and in arnolds case it shows years and years of drug abuse he was popping steroids like candy
GetMotivated,removed,you seemed more concerned with turning your own actions into something that can be considered morally good by society than simply accepting yourself for who you are i dont give two shits what society thinks of my preference to fit dark haired women nor could i care less if im offending someone by saying that if you get triggered or offended by the fact that people are attracted to specific physical features and you feel better by calling them shallow thats fine go for it i found a sjw
GetMotivated,removed,yeah because the average fat ass is super similar to the greatest olympian of all time
GetMotivated,removed,hahahahahahahahahaa delusional fuck your limit to fuck hotter girls isnt your body not by any stretch of the imagination its your face possibly your height and possibly your wallet too where do guys like you get the idea that women find more muscle more attractive the guys women find universally attractive are lean eg joseph gordon levitt adam levine beckham etc etc etc this is why the bodybuilding forums are full of virgins everyboy knows bodybuilders are gross to women but even a big muscular body wont ever give you more than
GetMotivated,removed,because it doesnt work see my other comment in this thread your face is times more important than your muscles shitty face genetics fucked
GetMotivated,removed,delete your replies or no i dont really want the time i spent replying to them to go to waste lol wow look at you writing off someones opinion solely on the basis of a label you gave them im calling you a sjw youre calling me someone who generalizes people and tries to write off others opinions something you defined as the same thing but thats not what im doing bar the fact that you just told me my opinion doesnt matter because of the label you gave me of course in your mind as a sjw it may look that way i like that you gave a good example immediately after but believe it or not people can choose to be attracted to whomever they want based on any and all physical characteristics that they deem attractive no one here denied that i can see you are now deciding what my argument is for me by your logic that makes you shallow really i dont recall ever discussing what my tendencies when pursuing a relationship are please dont speak for me and a hypocrite of what you didnt exactly do much to think through this one did you not me and heres the real heart of it people want their worldview to be the right one so they try to warp the commonly accepted right view of good morality to fit their view they are so obsessed with being right that they are able to reject reality and start labeling anyone suggesting otherwise as whatever term theyve created to ignore outside opinions people have always done this youre no exception quite a few words people like to throw around stuff like sjw is just a new one for the antipc crowd to get behind im not arguing it in my defense im simply stating that this particular topic does not make a person shallow definitions are definitions deal with it yes thats exactly what youre doing youre upset says the person who made a post attacking me quite significantly are you sure that i am the one who is upset and now you feel better because you called someone shallow shallow because they have different tastes than you do i im quite shallow myself fyi wrong i can spot a sjw from a mile away usually by the zeppelinesque shadow they cast over me so id love to hear this why am i a sjw other than the obvious reason of me disagree with you
GetMotivated,removed,just unsubscribe
GetMotivated,removed,if this was a picture of a woman sjws would be going bonkers
GetMotivated,removed,yea i forgot to go to the gym today that makes like years in a row
GetMotivated,removed,this sub makes me so sad when i come across it in rall im just sad that im fat and out of shape and i want to be better but i have zero willpower every time i try i fail everything in this picture is right it just makes me remember i have no discipline self respect work ethic or passion anyway
GetMotivated,removed,listen bro i dont even care lol im not even going to read your long ass post probably trying to justify whatever it is youre saying eat less problem solved adios
GetMotivated,removed,cant sorry
GetMotivated,removed,i feel sorry for you so caught up in this false and petty morality how does it feel holding that much hypocrisy in your head ohh thats right your morally superior im sure youve helped orphans in eastern europe or the starving children in somalia im positive you dont wear nike shoes or use computer products manufactured by space labor in china im positive you dont sit here in your nice warm house with your full belly and shed a single tear for the tradgedy of slavery as you eat unicorn farts humanily harvested so that no animals were harmed as you protest on your moral superiority on your computer produced by child labor before you seek the more from your brothers eye remove the beam from thy own
GetMotivated,removed,if you want to hit the gym thats great i love lifting but its our birthright to be a normal weight and for our appetite to naturally regulate itself we shouldnt need to earn it and it doesnt mean youre lazy or dont care enough if you find yourself fat its a problem were experiencing as a population lol ok i find the whole do you even lift bro attitude as annoying as the next person and youre right you dont have to work out to stay skinny lord knows i dont work out and look like a rail but thats because im also not eating myself into an early grave people are welcome to eat as much as they want and not work out but that will make them obese and obesity is not a normal weight
GetMotivated,removed,but anyone can achieve your level are you stupid this is obviously not true most people cant same goes for ability to play instruments sing intelligence etc genes are everything btw im just saying this body thing its not that i give a shit i have so many better things to do money and knowledge are way more important
GetMotivated,removed,being a healthy douchenozzle with tons of discipline doesnt mean youre necessarily furthering humanity either and i think what you meant to say was that telling a shitty joke or writing a dumb story doesnt make up for being an unhealthy slob with zero discipline you have to put the positive thing first if youre gonna compare them like that might want to work on disciplining your logic a bit
GetMotivated,removed,it does something to my motivation in a completely different way im curvy and petite ill never be a victoria secret model but i could end up like that cow fat people motivate me waaaaay more than super super fit people
GetMotivated,removed,what a racist
GetMotivated,removed,there is so much fat logic in your post its going to take a while to respond to all of it calories in vs calories out is certainly not counterproductive in fact that exact point needs to be hammered into the heads of pretty much every overweight person because its easy to understand and once you accept that simple truth you tend to make yourself more accountable my overweight mother kept spewing fat logic talking about how she couldnt lose weight how she ate calories per day and still maintained how healthy she ate etc i held strong and kept repeating the its calories in vs calories out argument and eventually she agreed to go on a diet while i was visiting during the summer no restrictions on type of food just a calorie budget and she got cheat days every lbs lost i had her track calories accurately and she lost lbs over the course of the summer people need to realize that you cant just eat all the unhealthy highcalorie foods you want and expect results people need to understand that obesity is very unhealthy and that the rare individual that is both overweight and healthy is the exception not the rule you seem like youre arguing to someone who isnt sure of what theyre talking about talking about things like how many calories are in a ham cheese sandwich a glass of oj newsflash you shouldnt be eating a ham cheese w oj if youre on a diet those foods are highcalorie and not very filling bacon eggs is a much more filling choice that is still tasty then you talk about calorie outtake but you dont need to work out to lose weight at all yes you will be healthier if you workout and yes it will increase outtake but just not being overweight is so much healthier that youre better off focusing on that rather than trying to do too much at once and getting burnt out once youve fixed one problem then you can worry about the other then you talk about starving yourself and being a gym slave which is probably the most egregious fat logic in your post you dont have to starve yourself you just have to eat fewer calories than you consume thats not starving yourself you also dont have to work out at all to lose weight though if you can find the willpower to do it on a diet then your results will be even better losing weight is as simple as calories in vs calories out if you want to lose weight just get your metabolism from one of the many online calculators subtract and eat that much food if you actually do that you will lose weight and it really doesnt take that much effort
GetMotivated,removed,except we now know schwartzenegger used steroids so
GetMotivated,removed,implants bruh implants
GetMotivated,removed,roids
GetMotivated,removed,but steroids are bought
GetMotivated,removed,steroids genetics and sociopathy argument defeated
GetMotivated,removed,because genetics are bullshit right
GetMotivated,removed,money sure can buy all of his steroids however
GetMotivated,removed,well technically you could buy steroids
GetMotivated,removed,arnold used steroids imho that invalidates everything in this meme
GetMotivated,removed,except you can inherit some great physiques through the genetic lottery no virtues needed
GetMotivated,removed,yo this guy does roids though
GetMotivated,removed,actually with hgh and roids you can buy it
GetMotivated,removed,self improvement is masturbation now self destruction tyler durden
GetMotivated,removed,roidheads have about as much discipline selfrespect patience work ethics and passion as a cheater because thats what they are cheaters
GetMotivated,removed,i lost pounds of dead weight in one day their name was my wife
GetMotivated,removed,also like ever heard of steroids people can use them to cheat
GetMotivated,removed,you dont use money to get steroids i guess you can only can steroids through hard work and dedication
GetMotivated,removed,and steroids fuck loads of steroids
GetMotivated,removed,it also shows you dont do anything else
GetMotivated,removed,one can cheat and buy steroids to help you get there easier
GetMotivated,removed,he is now a fat republican philanderer
GetMotivated,removed,but i mean steroids so for of people with that type of body it can also show you cheated
GetMotivated,removed,still playing that year old game have you even noticed its time for a change with the amount of money i assume youve spent on wow already if i were you i would demand a own statue of myself in the game for everyone to see you could probably have bought all the top games from the steam library with those money and own like games but now look at you you dont even own that one game youve spent so much money on is it starting to sting a little i can continue if you like
GetMotivated,removed,that and steroids
GetMotivated,removed,i know but every chance i get to say that i will
GetMotivated,removed,how much if this is built using steroids and hormonal injections
GetMotivated,removed,does it also show that you cheated on your wife with a housemaid
GetMotivated,removed,as im scrolling down to read more comments im starting to see a shitload of people say something along the lines of but steroids its absolutely hilarious how delusional some people are and shows how many people are still incredibly uneducated when it comes to building a solid physique if you think you can look like arnold who is mr o and the premiere icon of bodybuilding even to this day with just steroids then by all means go do it and see how it works for you yeah arnold juiced as does every other pro bodybuilder but his genetics are one of the primary reasons he looked the way he looked his symmetry is something you cannot emulate
GetMotivated,removed,and honestly if you know what a person is trying to say fuck you for getting hung up on that shit and trying to derail the conversation for little more than masturbatory purposes
GetMotivated,removed,ok hard work was there but so was steroids
GetMotivated,removed,takes steroids oops i just contradicted everything you said
GetMotivated,removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicsicouldcarelesspng title i could care less titletext i literally could care less stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
GetMotivated,removed,technically he did but the steroids that made them gains more pronounced
GetMotivated,removed,obsessions and addictions
GetMotivated,removed,in this case it also shows you did a lot of drugs
GetMotivated,removed,steroids are kinda a downer on this whole quote
GetMotivated,removed,except steroids you do buy steroids
GetMotivated,removed,except he took steroids so ya know
GetMotivated,removed,then read my first comment again
GetMotivated,removed,you can eat whatever the fuck you want if you pay attention to the equation calories in calories used weight
GetMotivated,removed,fair enough your personal experiences are not even remotely enough proof that fat people are irredeemable slobs though just like if i met a few douchey black people it wouldnt alter my perception on an entire subset of individuals
GetMotivated,removed,its clear you have no idea what youre talking about since you dont understand how the drugs work were discussing something on different levels the quote has nothing to do with sports so your diatribe about ethics doesnt apply the notion that you think van damme hasnt used drugs is niave no no it doesnt that physique is impossible to obtain without chemicals and the extraordinary amount of punishment they allow you to put your body through
GetMotivated,removed,fresh fruits and vegetables are cheaper than basic carbohydrates
GetMotivated,removed,no it still wont pay off you form nasty habits and youll lose friends because of it and find it more difficult to find new ones
GetMotivated,removed,so youre saying in places where there is upwards of obesity its all mental issues i refuse to believe that especially in a first world nation where access to information is free comparing it to muslims isnt valid either because the extremism comes from less thn of the muslim community which is in line with criminal rates the real reason is a lack of willingness to take life by the balls when most of it has been handed to you if anything we should be blaming the parents who let it happen to there kids
GetMotivated,removed,work ethic im not going to dig super deep into definitions here but steroids seem unethical theres a line drawn theres a reason steroids are banned a reason performance enhancing drugs are banned what kills it for me and many others is that his hard work and inspiration are undercut by the fact that he took performance enhancing drugs same with lance armstrong hella hardwork but it wasnt playing fair there will always be an asterisk next to them and barry bonds and other athletes in my mind can you imagine how inspirational it would have been if he had done it clean you can fudge definitions to suit your arguments all you want personally i think even creatine is too much you get more gains with steroids and even supplements than without for the same amount of other workcaloriesetc you put in
GetMotivated,removed,itt a bunch of anonymous neckbeards on the internet try to talk down to the fourth president and the guy who literally wrote the declaration of independence because he doesnt conform to the social norms of a society that exists over after his death yea youre right guys jefferson didnt have a clue and youre all so much wiser than him because after all slavery and such its a really good thing that a few hundred years from now after your greatgreatgreatgreat grandchildrens grandchildren are long dead future society wont be able to point out all of your beliefs that their age finds morally reprehensible because you know will always be
GetMotivated,removed,dude trust me when i say form is everything lift correctly and youll never be judged everybody is there to be better and if you have to start lower so be it lift like a jackass with improper form and gtfo the warehouse isnt big enough to contain your ego and nobody wants you around im generalizing here but this is the case with most high school kids their insecurity coupled with the excitement of seeing their first gains more often than not equals curling dumbbells using more momentum than kettlebell swings i see it every day at
GetMotivated,removed,yeah right no money can buy it but having it so you dont need to work all day and can go work out whenever the fuck you want doesnt hurt either
GetMotivated,removed,because hes an asshole and troll
GetMotivated,removed,you have no idea what youre talking about the average person burns way more than calories by just being alive sorry butt your way off
GetMotivated,removed,youre an idiot first no you are not passively burning calories bullshit second body fat is unhealthy for anybody body fat is unhealthy for males at either of these youre still a chunky bitch tits you dont approach healthy until youre around and less for aesthetics trust me i know exactly what im talking about and you have no fucking clue is a lot of calories for a desk bound pencil armed office worker you will be frumpy as fuck and look like golllum
GetMotivated,removed,well i guess nows the time to block this sub from my front page
GetMotivated,removed,apparently no one cares
GetMotivated,removed,please get out of here with your idiotic nonsense a quick google search will tell you otherwise
GetMotivated,removed,wasnt arnold known to use steroids before they were banned from bodybuilding competitions

GetMotivated,removed,how could we even do the most basic task in decision making judging a good result from a bad one we couldnt because we would have no way to compare this was not what i said and you know it stop pretending a history degree is the same thing as being knowledgeable in history most of those dipshits just cite each other in a circlejerk some outright just make stuff up history is not only useful its very important your dismissal of it as useless is objectively wrong i didnt get your point because your point was shit spending and many years to learn basic critical thinking is laughable on top of that most historians are basically liberal dipshits they even try to silence theories that go against mass agreement its a total joke the fact that you did so in a thread about not belittling other careersfields of study brings your judgement into question without even explaining why history is important its a thread about not belittling people not belittling career fields idiots in arts are still fair game history is great most people with history degrees are stupid as hell
GetMotivated,removed,nothing wrong with being a trashman or having any job its all about personal pride and not being a human waste of space dont like this comic its trying to be enlightening but its ignorant and insulting
GetMotivated,removed,you need hours of class per week for months to train properly for the nremtb exam there are essentially diploma mills that will train you to pass the rest but these graduates have an extremely high turnover within obtaining employment a cna is night and day different to an emt an emt is an actual medical provider ive never once seen a cna give a report by helicopter radio to a trauma surgeon document that report in a run report then defend that documentation in a court of law during a malpractice suit comparing us to a cna let alone a literally unskilled untrained garbage man is unbelievably belittling and ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,ah the classic fallacy of keynesian economics touted by vulgar shitheads everywhere
GetMotivated,removed,this comic pisses me off the woman in blue isnt wrong ignorant or arrogant shes wants the best for her son and knows working as a low paid service man will not offer the luxury that an educated major working at or making his own higherup business the woman in yellow isnt wrong either what i get from this is the difference between a liberal family and a conservative family a conservative family is strict and very traditional in their policies like the woman in blue she is strict on telling her son what to do with threats the liberal family wants to help others just like the lady in the yellow she wants her daughter to help others neither are wrong their message is the same they dont want their child to be a trash man the issue i have is that with the facial expressions given the comic is implying that the blue lady is wrong and i kinda take offense to this because i was raised in a sense with a very conservative mother who told me those same exact words she wanted the best for me a and never sugarcoated anything she told me flat out if i didnt push myself and study i would end up having a low paid job i wouldnt be able to live all the luxuries that i do now so i did study i now have a good paying job that i enjoy doing point im trying to say is being taught and raised in a conservative household is not a bad thing as this comic implies
GetMotivated,removed,anyone up for skydiving i dont know how it works but im sure we can figure it out once we get started
GetMotivated,removed,their commercials are the cheesiest most stereotypically dishonest racist misrepresentation of the country and the people who actually work there when was the last time you saw a white person working tim hortons or someone who didnt have a thick accent you would assume is probably a tfw they are so bad like so terrible they need to put some of these new immigrants in their ads to accurately represent the company put someone who speaks broken english with an accent in there their food is dirt cheap not in a good way their coffee is like crack cocaine i could go on and on
GetMotivated,removed,if its raining then its wet outside its not raining so therefore it cant be wet outsidehttpsyourlogicalfallacyiscomslipperyslope wait according to your example if alooking down on garbage men then bmurders its not anot looking down on garbage men so not bno murders that makes absolutely no sense you cant be serious you must be a troll
GetMotivated,removed,yeah a relationship where a woman enjoys the company of a man who only pretends to be her friend in order to get in her pants
GetMotivated,removed,大师求你帮我改下照片 跪谢
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,hehe all i read is butt sucking
GetMotivated,removed,httpskillsandbusinesscommuhammadalidoesntcountsitupsuntil
GetMotivated,removed,i loved watching ali fight but jesus christ why does no one talk about what a racist hateful bigot he was because hes black and can box
GetMotivated,removed,he hated white people called them all dogs during an interview that can still be seen on youtube fuck this racist piece of fake halal shit good riddance to bad rubbish
GetMotivated,removed,this man had an iq of and was racist why would you let him be your motivation
GetMotivated,removed,if this boxer was white and said the things he did nobody would be praising him i have nothing against muhammad ali but it is funny how nobody cares he was racist because hes not white
GetMotivated,removed,shut the fuck up you dyke im joking just sucks that reddit has to be reddit on a subreddit about getting motivated reddit is an asshole so am i but i try and be an asshole to other assholes
GetMotivated,removed,and he educated himself on how racist democrat polcies were abd became a conservative republican that helps all equally
GetMotivated,removed,probably they either fall into categories white republicans that know they are racist pieces or shit and theyll never get the minority vote save for some uncle toms like ben carson uncle toms
GetMotivated,removed,i think you accidentally hit something there much of that field is about hard work more than smarts
GetMotivated,removed,a couple years back when the mcrib was in town they had a buy a combo get a second sandwich for dollar promotion and i overdid it by buying small combos for myself and extra sandwiches making it mcribs fries and three sodas for about bucks ate all of it right there in the restaurant i was stuffed and had to relax for a while before trying to get up and walk home ubfoetunately i developed some flulike symptoms and ended up vomiting right there at the table and shitting myself on the way home i was so embarassed i took off my pants and underwear before i walked in the house made sure my wife wasnt in the living room and tossed them in a grocery bag that bag stayed in a corner of our garage until the day we moved out went back to mcdonalds a week later and when i ordered a mcrib combo the cashier kept looking at me and smiling fucking judgemental twat
GetMotivated,removed,give me a break wagging your finger and telling people just to work harder is an ignorant way to repair the systemic problems of society
GetMotivated,removed,no its a fair label because he perpetuates the sort of unchecked capitalism that harms workingclass communities i myself have criticism of the modern black community such as the homophobic and sexist aspects as well as prevalent internalized racism but i realize that much of this can be somewhat remedied by taking strides to help poor americans of any race rural or urban be able to easily get the resources to earn a livable family wage and gain easy access to some sort of secondary education where they can move on to break the cycle of unemployment or bluecollar jobs the bootstraps approach just isnt applicable in todays environment with living costs too high wages too low and college too expensive so yes dismissing major roots of a pervasive socioeconomic issue in order to appeal to your party by calling others of your race lazy does render uncle tom a fair label for the sort of political figure he is
GetMotivated,removed,you want a system that forces young children into bluecollar jobs early and perpetuates a system that keeps people in the projects gangsta rap sportsball and pot keep people in the projects not jobs
GetMotivated,removed,i have no clue if carson is truly this religious or not i do know that people tend to forget republicans competing in primaries are basically required to pander to the far religious right that means saying stupid shit like the earth is years old
GetMotivated,removed,lol says the self proclaimed troll
GetMotivated,removed,still convinced that his political run was all an act i would be shocked if someone as educated as him is truly that ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,this is touching and all but jesuss the dad could have a least you knowshowered and maybe combed his hair looks like the kid just grabbed the local town bum and posed next to him
GetMotivated,removed,now suck my dick gary
GetMotivated,removed,maybe this is the wrong subreddit for this but seriously how did this guy turn into the man i saw running for the republican nomination did he have a stroke mental breakdown why did he leave such a successful career to do nothing proselytize write books
GetMotivated,removed,hes educated but hes a fucking idiot the same could be said for a lot of people including myself
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,sorry which pedophile warlord
GetMotivated,removed,so how do smart people become so fucking stupid with religion and politics
GetMotivated,removed,which again is most people who have brain surgery but i wasnt talking about you i was talking about this guy
GetMotivated,removed,too bad this brain surgeon is just as ignorant as all the uneducated people in the us
GetMotivated,removed,rthathappened
GetMotivated,removed,global warming may be an issue but i dont see how evolution matters to a president
GetMotivated,removed,ben carson is a fuxking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,with a bachelors in womens gender studies
GetMotivated,removed,still a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,but first we need safe spaces then we can talk about working hard
GetMotivated,removed,found the racist
GetMotivated,removed,i like to call him the scientist who doesnt believe in science its somewhat astonishing that you can be smart enough with science to be a brain surgeon but at the same time be so ignorant as to not believe in the theory of evolution
GetMotivated,removed,stop being so damn ignorant about poverty jesus fucking christ its not as simple as you make it seem like oh we had the same opportunities why cant they make it work must be the way their parents are raising themtsk tsk clearly you dont come from a type of background that is riddled with poverty so fucking ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,it isnt formal writing thus not requirement to be a stuck up asshole like yourself
GetMotivated,removed,shame she couldnt fit in a few dont hate the gays books in there a couple times a week popular favourites and choices could have include gay people do not cause hurricanes comparing gay people to paedophiles and animalabusers is offensive and no the gay agenda is not a marxist plot its really just very fabulous interior design and jockstraps for everyone
GetMotivated,removed,but isnt he a conservative so that means he is an evil racist bigot and race traitor according to the tolerant and open minded left
GetMotivated,removed,congratulations youre just as qualified now hurry and flip that patty
GetMotivated,removed,british slang for being a pedo
GetMotivated,removed,why doesnt kid give his dad some new shoes instead of posing for facebook disgusting
GetMotivated,removed,bs in womens studies thanks dad
GetMotivated,removed,ive stopped more racist behaviour by being vocal than i have by being silent
GetMotivated,removed,although he may be a great surgeon hes a fucking idiot you dont have to be smart to be a doctor while most are case and point right here
GetMotivated,removed,you mean the guy that lied about stabbing a kid in high school ben carson might be the best neurosurgeon in the world but hes also a liar and in common sense a complete fucking idiot on top of that hes a day adventist another christian cult full of ignorance and stupidity i wouldnt call this guy an inspiration for this sub hes shady
GetMotivated,removed,thats some rthathappened shit
GetMotivated,removed,i mean he is probably building it for himself that mortar job looks like complete shit i doubt anyone is paying him for that half assed job
GetMotivated,removed,if you want to challenge the way it works you would have to cull the human population so that competition isnt so cutthroat youd have to legally require all jobs to be listed on public forums at least of job openings are never listed you would have to dismantle the privatepublic university system to remove the prestige of certain schools and eliminate the extreme privilege that some graduates have over others in the job market youd have to impose strict burdensome quotas on how many people are considered for acceptance or hire youd have to forcefully integrate all public schools together kids from poor neighborhoods getting the rich kids level of education youd have to ban private schools altogether youd have to set up a huge foster care system thousands of times bigger than what we have to remove potentially talented kids from shitty fixedmindset homes
GetMotivated,removed,you mean accreyate
GetMotivated,removed,youre absolutely full of shit give me a name give me a surgeons name in particular see you make outlandish claims and then you back it up by making further outlandish claims that you truly believe no one will fact check you on and if they did youd just ghost
GetMotivated,removed,it really doesnt exist but anyone you dont agree with is a nazi racist bigot homophobe
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,okay you seem to know my positions and opinions better than i do so tell me specifically which beliefs do i need to take a sober look at i think trump is a conartist and a joke but i dont hate himthats what i am trying to point to you there is such thing as nuance there are people on the left that are going to vote trump because they hate hillary some will go to gary johnson and others will vote jill stein the left isnt a uniform block of opinions where everybody believes the same but a spectrum and assuming everything you said about the left was true that wouldnt make it any less right if they said that ben carson was a racist bigot because he is you dont need to listen to tyt to recognize that you only need to listen to ben carson to recognize that
GetMotivated,removed,if i recollect right then you sound like dirt but i guess what you dont really know dont hurt
GetMotivated,removed,dont give up baby
GetMotivated,removed,hey it was never really about the jirly
GetMotivated,removed,using edgy as an insult then trying to be edgy yourself are you fucking retarded
GetMotivated,removed,my uncle william got an almost new red nissan juke by working parttime at home try this website
GetMotivated,removed,original post
GetMotivated,removed,lol people will agree with anything if their ignorant of the subject and the opposition isnt presented to them this is reddit man
GetMotivated,removed,if you think being born in a uneducated impoverished black family with no father figure today is harder than being born to an uneducated impoverished black family with no father figure in the you are biased ignorant dumb or all of the above
GetMotivated,removed,rthathappened
GetMotivated,removed,same im tempted to get a tattoo of the last paragraphs but knowing my luck it turn out to be a quote by herman goerring
GetMotivated,removed,yes all the posts on this sub are easier said than done but thats a given you have to acknowledge this and go the extra mile to put these words into action i know im going to print it out and look at it every morning i suggest doing the same run it through your head whenever you feel nervous about taking a risk youll better yourself because thoughts become words words become actions actions become habits and habits become your personality
GetMotivated,removed,doubt has killed more dreams than failure ever will a post i saw recently on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,whats the difference between apathy ambivalence and indifference
GetMotivated,removed,this is the kind of nonsense i would write when i was this sub should be renamed get cheese
GetMotivated,removed,hey kys
GetMotivated,removed,totally agree there are no inherent or objective values were just here ops post hints toward the idea of accomplishment as something to be necessarily valued it doesnt really mean anything the hellish reality of daytoday existence pinpricks creative and talented people to death having to earn the right to exist is if anything a place to start for projects but thats just my valueequality either way ill be dead and gone just like the rich man and just like the kid that starved in africa while i wrote this the whole thing is absurd
GetMotivated,removed,i think youre missing the part where youre commenting on a joke in a meme thread and getting butthurt that people are shit talking commies
GetMotivated,removed,are you calling me a gaseous nebula
GetMotivated,removed,but as far as coffins go
GetMotivated,removed,because theres nothing cooler than being a simpsons hipster
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,rtheredpill read the sidebar read the top alltime posts lift
GetMotivated,removed,did i go to wendys twice today
GetMotivated,removed,lol ive seen memes on here all the time youre full of shit
GetMotivated,removed,it is a meme but ive seen memes posted on here all the time he just wants to waive his big dick of authority around and be a bummer
GetMotivated,removed,this dude is on a roll look at his history havin a bad day champ lets take it out on some innocent and unsuspecting redittors going about their day lol moron
GetMotivated,removed,this actually motivated me
GetMotivated,removed,first off the goal isnt to get hoes your plan is bro level bullshit the true guide treat women with respect find someone you like who has similar interests and ask her out continue to treat her with respect be a good person and build a relationship together a meaningful relationship is worth random sexual encounters
GetMotivated,removed,are you trolling
GetMotivated,removed,whats wrong with my profile that has nothing to do with anything i wasnt baiting anyone i just started my opinion thats not against the rules
GetMotivated,removed,i just wanna take so much drugs so i die
GetMotivated,removed,i found having a specific deadline and sharing my goal with a close friend works for me in fact i built a website for doing so httpswwwpublicpledgescom
GetMotivated,removed,was recently proven to be false an article detailing the study was on the front page like a week ago
GetMotivated,removed,this comic only applies to people that are already extremely fucking privileged its not motivating in fact its actually depressing if you want to be rich just try to be rich ok mitt i guess illngo buy some more money too
GetMotivated,removed,ive read the unchanged frontpage for years without subbing or unsubbing to anything but this post made me unsubcscribe from a sub for the first time ever this sub and its world view seems very toxic to me it pretends to want to make peoples lives better but ultimately it makes them worse because it tells people to never be happy and if they are happy then they are doing something wrong because they need more than they have to be allowed to be happy always more no matter how much they already did or have and if they are happy then they should feel guilty about that very toxic life perspective
GetMotivated,removed,what bullshit edgy libertarian solves all of your lifes problems by saying its your fault also water is wet news at
GetMotivated,removed,also a straw occam and razors hominem right guys
GetMotivated,removed,i feel like ive interpreted this comic differently than most people i thought it was saying that these characters actually are content and happy with their lives because they still do things that arent controlled by some future goal of theirs i didnt think that the comic was saying that that was necessarily a bad thing but that it was just kind of the average being rich wont make you happy message
GetMotivated,removed,cool posts
GetMotivated,removed,glad to see this sub have people like you its good to always be critical and open like this
GetMotivated,removed,i agree that this comic is completely wrong but dont give up on trying to succeed in life just because one path you attempted didnt work out im also and in a very similar boat as you just this year i started learning a brand new set of skills that i hope to turn into a career even though its doesnt feel like my dream i think if i had seen at where i was now i would have been horribly depressed but im never giving up and neither should you ive failed more times than i can count and have rarely succeeded at anything at all and i have zero useful marketable skills or talents but you know what even if i was instead of i would keep pushing onwards even though sometimes it seems pointless i know you can find something else to work towards theres always more stuff in life fuck this comic and its message sometimes you try your hardest and it still doesnt work out to pretend that its that simple is ignorant but you should always keep trying nonetheless i hope this doesnt seem corny or anything but i felt compelled to respond because of how similar your situation sounds to mine
GetMotivated,removed,dude people fail each failure puts your goal further out of your reach
GetMotivated,removed,i highly doubt that thats the message of the comic also after all this comic is posted to rgetmotivated if the message would be just watch tv because its all just luck anyway this would not fit here at all its actually the opposite the person who chooses to watch tv is supposed to be the lazy negativeexample of how not to do it its supposed to show how that makes it his fault for not being rich just because of the choices he makes and of his lazyness you really think rgetmotivated would post a message saying just be happy and enjoy life as it is
GetMotivated,removed,many of the defaults have more like million subscribers eg pics aww gaming til perhaps the difference is accounted for by people who explicitly unsubscribe im not sure but my point was that the number of people who see this subs content by default is very large compared to the number who upvoted this post
GetMotivated,removed,doesnt the comic simply point out that if you like watching tv then maybe you enjoy that more than trying to become rich and you should learn to enjoy watching tv more honestly if you spend less time watching tv and more time working or learning finance you might get richer i dont think this comic is aimed at poor african kids who likely sold their tv for food
GetMotivated,removed,ultralibertarian the poor are only poor because they are lazy correct me if im wrong isnt that actually a conservative view
GetMotivated,removed,i want to be lazy and filthy rich fuck you comic
GetMotivated,removed,nice idea but clearly horseshit
GetMotivated,removed,seems we are interpreting this differently does it always just have to be about advancing your career and increasing your income to me it seems like this is the ultimate understanding of this sub its only about increasing improving changing doing what youre supposed to do not about being happy at all it even seems to me as if it wants to make you feel guilty for feeling happy when youre happy youre doing something wrong because you stopped trying to improve and from my understanding the comic seems to say exactly that whenever you watch tv you chose to not improve to not be rich so stop doing that stop being happy with what you have and what you are doing and go get rich but yeah up to interpretation
GetMotivated,removed,rest in pepperoni
GetMotivated,removed,front page only shows highly upvoted posts in a short amount of time this is why you see td on the front page all the time lots of activity lots of upvotes happening very quickly the frontpage doesnt exist to show you what the opinion of a sub is its to show you highly interesting contentaccording to the members of the sub that you may be interested in
GetMotivated,removed,getmotivated mods have a very lax moderation policy the sub is usually pretty toxic depending on how much the readers hate themselves and want to whine about how demotivating the content actually is
GetMotivated,removed,i have a job two infact
GetMotivated,removed,this needs to be endlessly spammed in of every rgetmotivated post
GetMotivated,removed,option a take responsibility for your actions leading to the inevitable conclusion that youre wasting your time posting a video of some black comedian a successful comedian who has accrued a net worth of million through tireless effort in a field where its notoriously difficult to become wealthy who is pandering to people with platitudes he doesnt believe option b do not take responsibility continue posting videos about how your lack of success is not your responsibility the fact is this if you try really try you will be more successful than if you do not that is the true moral of the tortoise and the hair even an incompetent can outperform an expert if the expert is a lazy ass
GetMotivated,removed,why are you all so raged people it seems that the cartoon expresses that you have the power to do it and all your reactions after you realise you have the power to do it is fuck you dont say i have the power to do it its much easier to blame it on something and not do it
GetMotivated,removed,to be honest the character in this comic thats telling us all this stuff reminds me of a few douchebag guys ive met in my life that were pretty damn young and pretty damn cocky they thought they had life figured out and would tell anyone and everyone about it when i was younger i tended to listen to them now that im older i realize they were always full of shit and hypocritical at that too
GetMotivated,removed,yuck time to filter this sub from all i think glad im not alone in thinking this is super patronising
GetMotivated,removed,its explained well through the links and also elsewhere in the thread my take on it is that it has a very pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality that is disingenuous as to how the world really works
GetMotivated,removed,to suggest that everything in your life is within your control is naive and also very condescending to people with real problems that are in fact outside their control this is the truth claiming that theres no external factor that can influent your life is not only ignorant but also cruel is like telling the reason why millions of soldiers in the world war die because their will to live is not strong enough heck in my business class they even taught that in order to help a business survive the owner must be aware of both the internal and external for the external factors you can only predict a part of it and hope that your business wont suffer much damage one more thing the comic totally missed is the competitors you dont have to be in the situation of the athletes who never win the championship to understand it imagine your want that ceo position would that position just lie there waiting for you to conquer no matter how long it takes well the president election says the opposite
GetMotivated,removed,then this comic has nothing to do with them its about people with the luxury opportunity and privilege to aspire to greatness its a good philosophy for those people what do you prioritize if you are healthy and well off family work business art what do you really want do you want to watch football all weekend and be a normal person or do you want to focus on bettering yourself for me im a writer so this comic hits home pretty hard everytime i want to go out waste time on reddit watch movies workout im sacrificing time i could be wriitng and making something out of myself every hour i have to work takes time away from this hobby if i want to make a career out of writing i need to put in the hours if i really wanted it i would put it above everthing else that i can sacrifice right now i only write about hours a week i waste a lot of time prioritizing in other areas of my life i cannot give up work time with my girlfriend or time with my family in friends its just not me but i waste a lot of time on reddit haha so this comic speaks to me and im not exactly well off i know a lot of people circlejerk about elon musk but when he was starting paypal with his brother he had the option between renting an apartment and paying for an office and server they decided for the server and slept in the office now hes a cult business leader its an example of prioritizing your goals over what is easy
GetMotivated,removed,what an absolute load of bullshit this is terrible and its much rather going to depress and misguide someone than motivate she want to be beautifull if she looks like a sack of potatoes she had a horrible disfiguring accident that destroyed her face no amount of figuring what she wants will make her feel like shes visually attractive to people if someone is mentally challenged no amount of repriotization will make him rich those are very hyperbolic examples but its like that for many people with many things i want to have full control over my halfparalyzed right hand what should i do fucking prioritize revulutionizing medicine jesus christ im done with this sub
GetMotivated,removed,you can always count on this sub to express worldviews that only work for middle class white males in north america or europe i guess thats motivating
GetMotivated,removed,steal and sell credit cards so everyone who values integrity above personal gain deserves to be poor you good sir can jolly well go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,right it doesnt work if youre born into a cycle of poverty andor abuse
GetMotivated,removed,why the fuck would you just steal someones comment from years ago if you want to voice your opinion do it if you want to just copy and paste what someone else said why not give him a credit damn karmawhoring at best paging urandomrealitycheck you made a great comment and i thank you for that
GetMotivated,removed,your post desribes of the submissions in this sub
GetMotivated,removed,this speaks to my thoery that libertariansanarchocaptitalistsrandians you know who im talking about are actually stuck in an adolescent stage of psychological development remember when youre in your teens and it really hits you wow i can make decisions and they impact my life and the world and for a short while you feel omnipotent at least i did anyway devoured nietzche and satanic philosophy as a result thought life was all about the self and its advancement remember that yeah i member anyway you realise you have agency and then you grow up a bit more and realise that we are interdependant fallible beings there are lots of things outside of our control life will not work out how we thought in many ways but thats ok and its no reason to give up if were stuck at that selfimportant delusionally unlimited mindset though the result is randian philosophy
GetMotivated,removed,tldr if you can read this comic and not think what a fucking jackass theres something wrong with you
GetMotivated,removed,most people who feel like you do dont succeed and have given up they get mad and upset thatthey are not just rich and can sit around playing video games all day one fact is true if you dont like your situation change it if it means getting a second shitty job and putting all of that money away so you can meet your goals then literally the point of the exercise privilege is bullshit ive had people tel l me that i have white privilege im latino by the way i grew up in the projects public housing we scrimped and saved literally i saved up all my birthday money i always asked for savings bonds from aunts uncles etc and pooled over with my parents to buy a piece of shit house we fixed up and moved into my mother dropped out of school in grade she pushed and got a job on an assembly line making medical products she went back and after to hour days went to get her ged then took advantage of a program her company had and went to community college getting her bachelors degree going to night school for years she left her job and got a job working as a secretary and eventually managed the cardiology section at a large city hospital my dad went blind after brain surgery and no we never got a dime out of that because it was and the hospital lost all records my parents saved like crazy for years and we got out we made a life and we sacrificed to get what was needed the idea that you simply want it is simplistic but if you dont make an effort and a plan you cannot blame privilege for others success sure starting with money makes things a lot easier but this isnt about how to have others succeed its about how do you better yourself
GetMotivated,removed,then go with that the first part of the comic is so extremely pompous and entitled that it undermines anything that is being said after it also it does take an awful lot of interpretation to get to a point that is not utterly cringewothy which is not helping at all
GetMotivated,removed,fuck yourself i dont want crohns i cant just want it away i want my father to not be dead you going to tell me to try harder to change that
GetMotivated,removed,jesus christ point at a ducking motivational post on this subreddit you cynical bastards holy crap this god damn subreddit is never satisfied what are you even doing here ive never seen a post where the comments are positive on this sub fuck you and you and all of you
GetMotivated,removed,the comments in this sub of losers are just as cringeworthy as the comic its motivation if you want a pity party go somewhere else
GetMotivated,removed,whay do you mean by for the most part youre pretty massively ignorant of reality
GetMotivated,removed,technically i can but currently im at work so maybe later i was using extremes to demonstrate that there are always options on one panel of the comic the dude says getting rich is just not as important to you as watching tv or being a good person for some reason people bitch about the tv part in the comments but no one mentions the good person part im not saying he should do it im saying that in the spirit of the comic he can do it and if were at it i mentioned he can trade stocks and there are probably hundreds if not thousands of opportunities to make money legally using the internet without getting your fat ass from your couch
GetMotivated,removed,this guy sounds more like a riamverysmart mod
GetMotivated,removed,back when this was posted on rstoicism it got a similar reception as its getting on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,at least give proper attribution to the
GetMotivated,removed,you have absolutely no reason to believe that person says or thinks fuck you dont say i can do it cause it easier to blame it on other things and say this or that is why i cant do it rather than actually do it you completely ignored the arguments presented to continue attacking a straw man im not offended i dont know where youre pulling that from i just think youre being annoyingly ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,i think perhaps the message behind the comic is simply you have control over your own life stop bitching about stuff if youre unhappy and do something about it thats a pretty basic philosophy and i dont really see any dangerous thinking in that particular message thats what i got from it anyway but ive been of the mind set i quoted above for a few years now do i think everyone can become rich no telling people otherwise is just dumb false hope
GetMotivated,removed,i have this weird view that you cant be friends with everyone there must be someone you disagree with or isnt worth your time otherwise youre too focused on others and you will never truly be happy so you have enemies good it means you stood up for what you believed in at some point in your life winston churchill someone who tries to be friends with everyone is truly friends with no one me wcs is better though
GetMotivated,removed,dont change who you are to get a girl what if he is constantly changing who he is to be friends with everyone
GetMotivated,removed,most of the stuff in this sub is disgusting and dumb its like everything is written by year olds living with their uppermiddle class parents
GetMotivated,removed,now imagine one of them is in a wheelchair and wants to walk again he obviously doesnt really want to walk or his spine wouldnt be broken
GetMotivated,removed,agreed i wasnt saying it in relation to the comic which by the way is getmotivated copy pasta i must have seen it times on this sub i was saying it in relation to stating that stop worrying about stuff not under your control is stupid advice however one point ill disagree on stoics dont advocate to just sit idly by and let fate dictate your circumstances but to instead take positive action thats aligned with your virtues its not an either or its a nuanced multifaceted topic which isnt surprising as were dealing with human nature
GetMotivated,removed,ok you probably couldnt care less about my deep thoughts about life but here it goes the division between shit you can and cant change doesnt exist theres a whole load of shit in between things you have a chance of changing thinks that look like you can change them and things you can always be better prepared for things you couldve known about if youd been smarter or more observant back then but now theyre gone and things you thought youll change and then it turns out the best you couldve done was absolutely nothing dont give up on anything saying i can never change it dont be delusional either dont ever think you couldve had anything if you tried its depressing either way
GetMotivated,removed,all this post is is talking about not worrying about the things you cant control sure the comic talks about working hard and you too might get rich or whatever in the beginning but you guys seriously need to stop this bullshit the main message is trying not to worry about the things you cant control at the very end of the panal i seriously do not see why there is nothing wrong with that of course everyone sees that not everyone can be rich or people have certain disorders that prevent them from that kind of care this comic is directed at people who are normal to be honest you can get butthurt and think how this comic offends all day long but the truth of the matter is how you honestly thought to look into a different direction if you are unhappy or depressed this isnt suggesting anything this is just simplistic at the best to cause some kind of motivation to do something seriously guys im a bit dispointed if all you do is talk about how this comic is about money and success in general its also accepting the things you cant control
GetMotivated,removed,do you usually try hard to debunk happy uplifting thoughts in others cant you let people attempt happiness without trying to break it down the hardest thing i found in achieving happiness is the neigh sayers like yourself who feel it is their duty to diss as much of other peoples attempts at happiness as possible if it doesnt work for you there is no need to try and ruin it for others that may be able to feel positive as a result of it just move on and read another post unsubscribe if these attempts at motivation do not resonate with you its like rushing into the cresh and stealing the kids candy the kids enjoy it do they need a speech on dental care there are other sources of candy go and get what you want elsewhere cos this sub seems like its not actually intended for people with your outlook
GetMotivated,removed,what an awful fucking comic a complete fallacy if you find this inspiring your a fucking idiot but dont worry darwinism will get you soon
GetMotivated,removed,depends how deep your are going by what we are talking about there was the op peoples wealth is largely affected by life choices this thread lazy wolves and logical reasoning which you seem extraordinarily resistant to if a is more likely to be b then b is more likely to be a i say it applies to all three and it was a great example im assuming you arent trolling but the level of personal attacks failure of basic reasoning blind lashing you display are extraordinary good day
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is fueled by stupid bullshit submissions like this most motivation is about pretending the real world doesnt exist and its often preached by the hardesrcase losers no on likes admitting theyre jammed for reasons beyond their control but its often the case some people just dont understand math some people have too many health issues to let them benefit from a gym routine and most people are never going to be rich because its a limited resource thats hoarded by a few most cases you cant do nothing about anything but rgetmotivated lets people have moments to think they can so they dont just try offing themselves let the failures have their stupid ignorant hope its what helps the rich get richer
GetMotivated,removed,well his emails on his site so in this instance im pretty sure you can have what you want akimbocomixhotmailcom
GetMotivated,removed,perhaps the motivating aspect of this comic is to learn how to address ones needs thoughtfully so that you may shut down assholes like this in real life when they start spewing out simplistic mess the comic would have been better with of the rant if the point was to be motivating if it was to show that the character is kind of a dick it did just fine also im unsure ive ever heard someone talk about wanting to be pretty like that it made me sad for women
GetMotivated,removed,this the circle jerk in the top comments is real
GetMotivated,removed,oh this is so fucking retarded what kind of dickhead thinks that people just do what they want i bet the guy who wrote this lives in his own special bubble every time he tries he succeeds and thinks that life is the same for everyone else cunt
GetMotivated,removed,and its a shame he just copied someone elses answer form years ago when someone posted the same comic on this sub he could mention its not his but he wanted sweet karma and got gold for someone elses genius thought what a bandito
GetMotivated,removed,this quote doesnt even fucking make sense the guys on the couch may have just gotten home from work so fuck you and your stairs
GetMotivated,removed,that makes no fucking sense who would be trying to get from one floor to another on a couch it is like the first half of the quote and the second half are two different quotes mashed together into one nobody even fucking tries in this sub they dont even try this sub fucking sucks this garbage keeps getting upvoted and i am sick of seeing it constantly on the front page is there a way to ghost a sub in my options to make it to where my intelligence isnt insulted once a day with this low effort karma farming bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,it took me a second to realize this wasnt rrunningcirclejerk
GetMotivated,removed,this gem got me to unsubscribe lol
GetMotivated,removed,heres a link to a very long post i made a few months back to a person who felt the same way as you do i hope you find what you need
GetMotivated,removed,rthathappened
GetMotivated,removed,i just want to come back one more time im talking to you not to the rest of the people on this sub what is this nonvoluntary taxation someone is feeding you these lines and they dont like you taxes are by definition nonvoluntary because people dont volunteer to fix the neighbors sewer and if no one fixes the neighbors sewer none of the sewers get fixed asking for voluntary taxation is like asking for a triangle with sides it doesnt exist but the line did tell me a lot about you that and the fact that you are working shifts someone has told you that your enemy is poor people and the government your real enemy is the business model that says workers need to put in these kinds of hours and the pay structure that says you need to work this much to get by instead of supporting billionaires who dont want to pay for roads and sewers for buys like you and i will guarantee that the person who fed you that line is working for one of these people you need to be supporting unions minimum wage increases and greater taxation of the rich then you wouldnt need motivation to get through your life you would just plain have a better life
GetMotivated,removed,wow this coming from a man whos face is on swedish television like times a day telling people to join him on the worlds largest betting site
GetMotivated,removed,how is this meant to get someone motivated is this sub just about pictures with quotes do they not have to be motivating
GetMotivated,removed,because thats not the way the media wants to take it and spin it and turn it into fear because then youre watching television youre watching the news youre being pumped full of fear theres floods theres aids theres murder cut to commercial buy the acura buy the colgate if you have bad breath theyre not going to talk to you if you have pimples the girls not going to fuck you and its just this campaign of fear and consumption and thats what i think its all based on the whole idea of keep everyone afraid and theyll consume
GetMotivated,removed,man fuck this sub

GetMotivated,removed,i dont dislike him for dodging the draft i dislike him for the way he treated smoking joe frazier he called an uncle tom and a gorilla heres an article about how he antagonized smoking joe and just how much it affected him
GetMotivated,removed,fights for a living refuses to serve his country because he doesnt believe in violence talks about service to others
GetMotivated,removed,fuck all this ali shit they guy was a great boxer but was a piece of shit he promoted hatred and caused racial damage to our society that lasts until this day he was a wife beater he was illiterate and just a little man all around letting himself be used as a medium for dispersing propaganda his views werent his views he was just a coward who was afraid to fight for his country its easier beating up white women
GetMotivated,removed,he was also unbelievably cruel to joe frazier a man who had campaigned for his ban to be overturned and had loaned him money while he couldnt fight
GetMotivated,removed,then why do i have to pay rent to the landlord
GetMotivated,removed,thats so classy to take pictures at someones funeral then post them onlineyoure one classy guy

GetMotivated,removed,and then when the wave peaks low effort posts get gold
GetMotivated,removed,his landlord mustve been a rentraising bastard
GetMotivated,removed,and he sold his fight against joe frazier by being a complete racist asshole ali was a complex man with some good and bad and to ignore the bad is to do a disservice of what he meant to the world
GetMotivated,removed,is this the rent he paid httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmklwazhtfsq
GetMotivated,removed,no its okay because those were ring antics for the purpose of entertainment you twat
GetMotivated,removed,is this what you fucking morons learn in college
GetMotivated,removed,i feel like this posts message was very different
GetMotivated,removed,this is start to finish bullshit its not beautiful attending postsecondary has nothing to do with saving the world if your goal is to save the world and you only save yourself you have failed not shocked an anthropology prof said this though that discipline is riddled with sjw dipshits
GetMotivated,removed,unfortunately nothing remotely close to the one i had lost took me most of years there to get to that point not that i cant start over somewhere else but my former employer is very well known and liked hes petty and bitter not good terms and all cannot use them as a job reference from being slandered and they cock block me when potential jobs call them for references
GetMotivated,removed,please spend more time with her and dont kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,most significantly i learned to set goals pretty much everything else has come from that the worksheets i use are in httpswwwredditcomrgetmotivatedwiki i got on a budget and got out of debt i started to eat healthier and drink more water i started exercising regularly im starting to focus on my sleep now im working on not using any screens for minutes before bed

GetMotivated,removed,oh i visit a subreddit which posts silly quotes every day that keeps me motivated s the truth is you dont stay motivated forever eventually reality catches up and you find out that its all for naught and we give up on the farce you will find out one day that the most bitter people are the idiots who had been reading silly tony robbins bullshit or nonsense from this sub
GetMotivated,removed,maybe youre starving to death

GetMotivated,removed,rthathappened
GetMotivated,removed,this is something cute and twee i would have done before i let a decade of life in seattle surrounded by passive aggressive portlandiatype fuckwads make me a bitter old lady this pic makes me want to write mean versions of the same letter with hey fuckwad on it imploring the famously passive aggressive residents to stop being such turds then step back in the shadows and watch as people read them if they toss it back on the ground all disgustedlike i can become a passive aggressive resident too and get smug on them for littering when they should have carried it with them to the nearest recycling bin
GetMotivated,removed,please work on your reading comprehension skills lil buddy and see if you can get them past fifth grade level go back and read that story five times to learn from it not your makebelieve side rant

GetMotivated,removed,no not racist also not by any stretch limited to africa if youre familiar with jeremy clarkson he did a series some years ago called jeremy clarkson meets the neighbors and in italy he spoke to an italian sociology professor who addressed the same phenomenon thus being early being on time is an act of slavery being late is an act of liberation
GetMotivated,removed,elaborate
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is obsessed with vague poorly explained metaphors
GetMotivated,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

GetMotivated,removed,sharing a positive perspective this mlk day and this inauguration week the night of the last presidential debate i turned off the tv stunned it was hard to believe that after years of a punishing campaigns we were skidding into an election like this feeling the collective frustration and seeing negativity everywhere i couldnt add to the doomsaying or post a diatribe that was going to make myself of anyone else feel better about it so i started thinking about how we get ourselves into these situations and what the common themes are if i could simplify it and look at it more objectively maybe thered be a positive way out it seemed like most of the dialogue around the election was missing the kind of basic human decency youd find in almost any childrens book so heres make the serengeti great again httpwwwlamontcreativecomserengeti
GetMotivated,removed,gaaaaaaaay in like a progressive endearing way though
GetMotivated,removed,this guy cheated on his wife

GetMotivated,removed,fuck off dude it isnt
GetMotivated,removed,no no no its the kkk youre thinking of not nazis man jeeze ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,youd be calling it racist if they did the exact opposite too
GetMotivated,removed,why is this sub such shit
GetMotivated,removed,all the characters in king of the hll are deeply flawed and andlack any empathy whatsoever conniekahn jris the only character that is depicted as any sort of straight man even hank has an epiphany when he realises he is violent and always kicking peoples asses as a got to his relationship with bobby is just basically one parenting mistake after another i always find it funny when americans unironically referto himas somesort of rolemodel parroting all the racist and sexist shit he says for example like it was some deep wisdom and telling it like it is whe nthe whole point is to showcase his backwards and counterproductive views
GetMotivated,removed,if you want that isnt relevant in the slightest keep denying that hard work is what you need and youll never do anything you need this sub
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is fucking awful
GetMotivated,removed,admittedly insensitive and kind of ignorant but not racist
GetMotivated,removed,lmao so many butthurt comments here but its reddit so thats to be expected
GetMotivated,removed,have none of you watched king of the hill i once tried to change the channel to king of the hill when i was watching tv at a friends house and she screamed racist at me she said she had never seen the show but trusted the people who told her it was racist
GetMotivated,removed,holy shit something productive actually made it to the fp of this sub i expect this to be fixed by tomorrow
GetMotivated,removed,lol you are clearly triggered you cant even address anything i said and yell nonsense instead you alswo ignoresd everything else about the original post and blew your lid about the words racism and sexism as expected again lets take bobby as an example he is constantly worried that he might be gay for example he is always taking feminine items and hobbies away from him this image is reposted constantly on reddit alone its basically the mantra for thedonald have fun with your outrage now
GetMotivated,removed,exactly the one episode where cotton was to receive a medal from the emperor of japan and he was going to spit in his face hank spent the whole episode trying to convince cotton not to because the war was long over and there was no reason to hate the japanese hank also was good friends with his work friend enrique he was ignorant but far from racist
GetMotivated,removed,youre in a thread acknowledging that hank has many flaws this person came by to claim hes racist and sexist despite no evidence and youre agreeing with him because hes stating the already established point that hank has flaws
GetMotivated,removed,im laotian what ocean laos you idiot its a landlocked country in southeast asia in all honesty it was ignorance not racism in that episode but it is one of my favorite quotes
GetMotivated,removed,hank means well and i like how goddamn personally you are taking all this lol the aggressiveness of your commentary is going to attract downvotes we are talking about a cartoon character after allso why the hell not lol generally i agree with you andmy point is that generally americans dont see when a cartoon character is supposed to be satire and take it at face value i agreethat hank hill as a character is well meaning and not racistbut he is used to lamppoon racist ideas and its those very satirical sayings that people on reddit parrot like its actually a depiction of some hidden truth and how it is like this
GetMotivated,removed,your arrogance makes me hope you get hit by a car on one of those runs
GetMotivated,removed,so not racist just ignorant totally different
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think you know what racism is
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think you know what racism is
GetMotivated,removed,indeed some americans just take it as a personal insult for some reason my theory is that these peoplearethe same peoplewho unironically post the shit that hh or even bill says as a legit political talking point lol
GetMotivated,removed,lol what the hell are you talking about holy shit itslikeiinsultedyorpersonalmessiah who is a cartoon depiction of an old ignorant idiot who thinks god told himto sell propane he is a dad odf an obese child and he madehimaddicted to cigarettes pretty much all the decisions he makes backfire horribly but he is like jesus toyou people amazing shit really
GetMotivated,removed,oh for sure for the most part hes a great role model and has a lot of valuable things to say but there are times hes completely ignorant and intolerant i have no specific examples but i know at certain points ive been watching and thought to myself wow really so the few times he does display his flaws its really stood out
GetMotivated,removed,the griffiths in general are a piece of shit fake cartoon family its my biggest gripe with the show that the family just isnt realwell not my biggest gripe my biggest gripe is the constant breaking of comedic triplets and the constant use of absurd comedyjust because something is weird doesnt make it funny even if you repeat it the simpsons might have some troubles but homer and the family always come together at the end homer hurts his family out of stupidity peter is aware of how his family will be hurt and maliciously does things anyways
GetMotivated,removed,if you had minded your own business in wwii you wouldnt have been impoverished from the cold war or have you country invaded by nonwhites
GetMotivated,removed,the japanese didnt actually surrender immediately after the first bomb was dropped we had to drop another bomb before they finally gave up practically the entire population was prepared to fight to the death they were giving up ground left and right outside of their actual country but a ground invasion of japan itself would have been immensely bloody for both sides
GetMotivated,removed,to let him know i read it and find his comment worthless that certainly sounds like you care a great deal about him and what he thinks though doesnt it makes it hard to believe that you actually dont care if he responds or what he has to say someone has to let idiots know they are idiots but why wouldnt that apply equally to any response that he might make to tell me im missing the point while missing the point of my post is the kind of rich commentary that reddit seems to engender and embrace did he miss most of the point of your post though i mean maybe he understand all of it and agreed with everything except your statement of the aggressiveness of your commentary is going to attract downvotes i mean that seems to be the only thing he really objected to overall in fact he went out of his way to say that most of your post was already agreed on and established to the only part that he clearly objected to he presented a counter point that seems at least valid enough that branding him as an idiot seems to be a reach
GetMotivated,removed,this is exactly it just look at all the outrage saying im just jealous of americans sjw or something equally stupid american rednecks really like cartoons and simplistic talking points
GetMotivated,removed,lol how nice of you you are going around trolling people in rgetmotivated but are concerned for my mental well being and growth what a kind caring individual you are one day i hope to have a life as full as yours
GetMotivated,removed,all youre proving is that youre an immature jackass
GetMotivated,removed,if we hadnt stressed about the nazis the world would be a better place
GetMotivated,removed,i just find the characters interesting and the depiction of hank is intentionally that of an oblivious conservative dad who has his heart in the right place but lets his backwards views ruin basically everything throughout the episodes you are taking this way too personally because when you look in the mirror you think of a cartoon character depiction of a moron
GetMotivated,removed,if youre in a situation where the only thing truly holding you back is laziness youre one of the luckiest people alive probably the wisest thing ever said on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,also itsjut one example consider the depictions of laotian people it couldnt be more a racial stereotypeall the wqay downto their own racism against white people kahn and minh themselvesarealways conflicted about their laotian roots and accepting the redneck ways all the black characters are also as sterotypical as possible the whole show is based onthis if you cant see ityou are just proving my point im not saying the showis racist but pretty much allthe characters have highly racist and ignorant views thats what makes it so funny granpa cotton cant even go to a japanesse steak house or he gets flashbacks its not just hank hill its everybodyon that show except connie
GetMotivated,removed,that is not justified to the fact that the nukes killed innocent women and children civilians for what just to save few american soldiers that is a war crime in todays standard lets just be honest that america dropped the nuke on japan rather than germany because they saw the japanese as lesser humans racism is a big influence here
GetMotivated,removed,great argument as always american consider the depictions of laotian people it couldnt be more a racial stereotypeall the way down to their own racism against white people kahn and minh themselves are always conflicted about their laotian roots and accepting the redneck ways all the black characters are also as sterotypical as possible the whole show is based on this if you cant see ityou are just proving my point im not saying the showis racist but pretty much all the characters have highly racist and ignorant views thats what makes it so funny granpa cotton cant even go to a japanese steak house or he gets flashbacks its not just hank hill its everybody on that show except connie

GetMotivated,removed,how dare he try to tell a young person who doesnt think the world can ever be better than their limited experiences not to kill themselves what a monster for trying to encourage people to stick around and realize that its not all bad
GetMotivated,removed,except sjws take this message and use it as an excuse to be and hate everyone who isnt lgbtqasftfjf with purple hair i am ace and have green hair but i dont use being weird as an excuse to hate people who arent weird dont corrupt this message for your own goals k thx
GetMotivated,removed,hang in there op many people fail the first time they try something im sure youll get it right the next time
GetMotivated,removed,why are you so butt hurt over the word she he has the right to choose his own words deal with it
GetMotivated,removed,lol why so butt hurt just because he said she its just a word in this context it can mean male or female if he had said he would you claim he is implying girls can kill themselves
GetMotivated,removed,right what should the dude be saying isntead i tried to kill myself and things ultimately worked out but maybe you should kill yourself because you probably wont be famous
GetMotivated,removed,why is it offensive to ask im supposed to refer to people by their preferred pronouns but when i ask what this person identifies as based on the context of their speech im being ignorant this is why so many people dislike pc culture
GetMotivated,removed,yeah but he looks pretty androgenous if you arent familiar with this person or their work its not unreasonable to be confused
GetMotivated,removed,thats dismissive and sexist
GetMotivated,removed,i have had suicidal thoughts before but this cheesy bullshit does not help lmao
GetMotivated,removed,i just hate how all the emo kids are like i tried to kill myself times bitch you didnt its very easy to kill yourself if you actually intend to be successful
GetMotivated,removed,tips fedora
GetMotivated,removed,ah a bigly shithead
GetMotivated,removed,i found that odd if you dont like to say he when referring to no specific sex then just say he or she or just fucking they if youre against assuming theyre a man then why would you do the opposite doesnt make any sense its like people of color who are racist against white people to stop racism
GetMotivated,removed,if you actually want to kill yourself you will succeed dying is easy people do it while actively trying not to every day
GetMotivated,removed,enters buttholes
GetMotivated,removed,i think the phrase is id rather be unhappy and rich rather than happy and broke

GetMotivated,removed,haha i love this to all u kids who want to kill yourself because you feel like you dont belong youre wrong glad i could help cure your severe depression
GetMotivated,removed,should kill yourself for using this damn small ass font jesus christ and who the hell is graham moore
GetMotivated,removed,silence around successful people talking about depression and suicide where does he mention depression i thought he tried to commit suicide because he thought he was weird
GetMotivated,removed,goddammit you couldnt even kill yourself and im supposed to be motivated by you
GetMotivated,removed,wtf women do attempt suicide more often he was just adding context jackass fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,no it doesnt the comment you replied to specifically stated that men successfully commit suicide more often than women they agree with you that its an issue for men so why are you trying to refute them
GetMotivated,removed,alternatively look at the empty jar at the end of december and kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,i cant even begin to describe the irony that youre here to enforce the social attitudes that men should never be acknowledged as victims of anything which is part of what leads to their far higher suicide rate does that irony include you bitching about the way society treats victims of suicide while at the same time implying that men are the only victims that really matter
GetMotivated,removed,i mean grammatically yes but logically its sexist as fuck
GetMotivated,removed,unless youre being put in a straitjacket and being forcefed then you can kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,i love how red pill chucklefucks assume everything other people do is insincere someone is being considerate in some way virtue signaling virtue signaling you guys live really pathetic lives no wonder no one wants to date you
GetMotivated,removed,successful suicides are the only real version of suicides the attempts are almost always people thinking they want to commit suicide but purposefully try less successful ways its a psychological trick the body does unconsciously to trick someone into thinking theyve decided against it the human body is a very very fragile thing all real suicide attempts either are successful or almost always result in some form of physical damage liver failure from drug use gunshot wound if you really want to kill yourself and i mean really want to opposed to a huge bout of depression where you hold a knife to your throat but dont do it its not hard to do
GetMotivated,removed,but if youre weird different and a failure then just kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,its often really strong in this thread a lot of losers whove never accomplished anything in their lives come in here frequently to go it was luck they didnt actually earn it keep telling yourself that buddy keeeeep telling yourself that 😉
GetMotivated,removed,then go be a fuckhead somewhere else and take your extra chromosome with you
GetMotivated,removed,then it is a cry for help its not that hard to kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,yeah uilickanalblood stay different
GetMotivated,removed,are they really trying to commit suicide if they are attempting it more yet men are still times more likely to kill themselves than women with statistics like that surely most of those are just cries for help
GetMotivated,removed,the buttholes are the penis retrievers
GetMotivated,removed,on what planet is this good evidence that you should try to compete with sjws in the victim olympics
GetMotivated,removed,lots of sjws
GetMotivated,removed,how many people do you think are aware of that pills not working in terms of suicide is only a recent phenomenon if you tried it about a decade ago you would most likely die but people using them for suicide is exactly why its hard to do its not just pills either there are a million other ways to non violently kill yourself that includes drowning suffocation carbon monoxide poisoning straight up normal poison hard drug overdoses etc its not even about looks either women in general are not as aggressive as men its simply the side effect of a lack of testosterone is shooting yourself in the head violent yes it is therefore women wont do it as often which isnt saying the dont do it just that theyre less as likely to theyre much more likely to just go close the garage door and sit in their running car this is a statistical fact
GetMotivated,removed,but also dont be otherwise well troll the ever living hell out of you also the internet
GetMotivated,removed,if all i wanted to do was sob all mfeels when i went to reddit then i would not filter this sub from all but i dont care about this
GetMotivated,removed,have you gone to school in the past years god youre ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,theres a sect of literarytypes not sjws either who prefer to standardize to feminine pronouns rather than masculine or nonspecific which clearly doesnt include him and i agree with the other commenter my only thought was that it was silly and contrived
GetMotivated,removed,good for you mr moore you became successful most of the kids you are talking about wont they will be downtrodden and bullied by other kids because we fail to control and discipline children properly while they are developing i was different and weird at school i am not successful the only thing i took away from school was a severe mistrust of other humans i literally wouldnt turn my back on a single person for over a decade i didnt have relationships with girls or women all through my teens and twenties i thought everyone was scum and not to be trusted thats what happens to bullying victims thats why they commit suicide the only thing that kept me from committing suicide was stubbornness and hate
GetMotivated,removed,says the guy who posts in subreddits that are home bases for hate groups shame about your life bro but im sure its not going to get any better
GetMotivated,removed,wow thats a pretty nice fantasy life youve come up with shame itll never be real run along little racist run along
GetMotivated,removed,if you are going to be weird you had better be really good at it mediocre weird is just that not memorable doesnt pay well at all i have an issue with people who just happen to be the that make a living at it telling other people to go for it who most likely are just not that good at being weird before the sjws troll on this is not about being lgbt i have no idea who this guy is
GetMotivated,removed,ugh more gay issues spam
GetMotivated,removed,not to sound racist but i wonder if thats a large reason for success in the asian american community cultural team players with the ideals of american individualism is a great balance
GetMotivated,removed,doesnt surprise me sjws in general really shoot their causes in the foot by trying to view everything through the lens of oppression and liberation even if the subject matter is completely unrelated
GetMotivated,removed,graham moore its easy to succeed in hollywood when your
GetMotivated,removed,yeah its better to lose hope and just kill yourself come on you get the message its a nice much needed it gets better message that could prevent someone from killing themselves as we speak cynicism is not a mark of a superior intellect it is just cynicism
GetMotivated,removed,everybody is so weird and different nowdays xd be wacky seriously how is this motivating deep down he wouldnt trade his position for an actual social outcast
GetMotivated,removed,dude why is he only talking to the girls fucking sexist
GetMotivated,removed,so a pedophile should stay pedophile
GetMotivated,removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicstenthousandpng title ten thousand titletext saying what kind of an idiot doesnt know about the yellowstone supervolcano is so much more boring than telling someone about the yellowstone supervolcano for the first time stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
GetMotivated,removed,you shore do have a purdy mouth mlady
GetMotivated,removed,its a harsh truth that most people realize in adulthood that you probably wont be rich famous and win oscars just like you probably wont win the lottery so if youre waiting for your big fuck you moment to tell off the mean jocks at the high school reunion you may find yourself disappointed you may also find that those mean jocks were just as immature as you were in high school and live with regret for their behavior or were going through trauma at home or maybe not some people are just assholes either way letting go of past hurts and forgiving people their inadequacies will make you a happier person in the long run
GetMotivated,removed,regardless of whether its about becoming famous in the entertainment industry or not its all about telling people who are suffering now that maybe someday they will get away from the terrible things that plague them it gets better is a sop that is cold comfort to people in the here and now especially if they understand the reality that it is not a guarantee frankly im sick of people focusing on the fact that for them personally it got better why isnt the message remember that weird kid you used to bully you might have killed him fuck you stop it why is the onus on the sufferers always to endure it with a patient shrug why not a broader suggestion to everyone to make it better
GetMotivated,removed,its easy to be socially awkward and write it off as everyone elses problem thats selfish other people have to interact with you dont make it uncomfortable for them just because youre too lazy and arrogant to behave normally jesus christ this is such a shitty thing to tell socially awkward people its not like they fucking choose to be awkward nor is improving social skills as linear or straightforward as learning to ride a bike suggesting that every awkward person is that way because theyre too lazy to learn is so ridiculously ignorant and cynical therere multitudes of factors involved such as bullying isolation mental health disorders etc that affect their social abilities its arrogant of you to think that the difference between you and socially awkward people is that youre more hardworking and selfless than them get the fuck over yourself
GetMotivated,removed,wow hes so sexist
GetMotivated,removed,i cant tell if this is a troll comment or not can you explain why you think he doesnt remove the other more than half of the population that isnt a he
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you idiot
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,women make up at least half the population and more than that in many places im not making this about ideology you are youre trying to change the way the language has been used for centuries just because you think its sexist or something masculine isnt the neutral gender because of patriarchy or some bullshit it just is how is being the default better than being the exception having your own linguistic gender could also be viewed as a good thing do you think men enjoy being seen as the default anyone whos confused by his usage in this context just isnt paying attention to the rest of the sentence i dont care that you think it isnt that confusing youre adding levels of confusion to an imperfect medium youre trying to change the way people have been talking for ages —the way people understand speech– just because you choose to apply you own arbitrary pretext as to why the feminine gender should be the default this isnt ok
GetMotivated,removed,some illnesses can be alleviated but for a lot of illnesses medicine seems to be hopeless how would you for instance help someone with prefontal lobe damage and horrendous executive function or an autist without any social skills sadly such things cannot be cured at least not now
GetMotivated,removed,why she sexist
GetMotivated,removed,ok i get that they could be useful but when you get to zir ze and em then things are just confusing and feels like im being trolled with the large list of pronouns there has to be a way to simplify this process
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off if you dont like it go somewhere else
GetMotivated,removed,its the same thing when people come in to a topic that is clearly a womens issue and say but what about the men death by selfharm is overwhelmingly a mens issue and yes it should be dealt with differently to lower the rates based on gender men commit suicide for different reasons than women attempt suicide the women that die by self harm are more comparable than people of any gender that are just attempting male attempts included putting attempts and actual deaths in the same column and trying to solve the issue isnt going to work because these are not the same problem
GetMotivated,removed,what i can tell is that youre butthurt about other people making choices that dont affect you because you perceive those choices as antisexism and that youre enjoying acting like you know a lot more about linguistics than you actually do youre the one who doesnt understand the difference between over time and overnight
GetMotivated,removed,i thought the game was the name of the game i mean its right therealso fuck you i lost
GetMotivated,removed,the stage means doing whatever the fuck you want to do it means life it means being content with what you want and who you are
GetMotivated,removed,she kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,this fat ugly man is in hell sucking of dinosaur cocks while hitler is cheering him on
GetMotivated,removed,kill yourself if you dont make it to the stage by your early
GetMotivated,removed,too troo like im too chains
GetMotivated,removed,would describing this as eric thomas meets jackass be a fairly accurate description looks pretty cool ive always wanted to take boxing or kick boxing lessons but it seems very intimidating walking in there the first time maybe ill just approach it like the bucket list boys lol
GetMotivated,removed,no you dont what a fucking weird thing to be arguing about to begin with but then to make up blatant bullshit in attempt to look right best case scenario youre a troll worst case is youre a loser actually its six and a half a dozen
GetMotivated,removed,its actually because of his white privilege that he accomplishes things
GetMotivated,removed,gotta love ignorant people im an individual stuck near the bottom but i would prefer someone like you sitting on top asshole or not you at least know
GetMotivated,removed,hot damn this sub is absolute shit this comic strip really resonated with me and i ended up saving it so i can look back on it later when i feel a bit lost but no you fuckers need to tear not only the comic to shreds but each others beliefs and comments to shreds as well honestly the biggest motivation from this sub comes from the comments because it motivates me to not be a bitter soul like the majority of you
GetMotivated,removed,im a piece of shit and i did it all myself nobody foretold of my shitiness and how epic it would be legend doth not speak the shitstorm that would become my life
GetMotivated,removed,this is the comic that motivated me to finally un subscribe to this sub
GetMotivated,removed,only if youre a manchild what poetry have you read
GetMotivated,removed,holy shit those are words to live by lets make a quote out of this you are going to die anyway so find what you love and let it kill you badass fucking badass
GetMotivated,removed,lots i had to take poetry in college i learned to hate poetry so its as i initially thought youre a manchild with bad taste man is often used in a gender neutral way get over yourself and go develop some taste before commenting on a topic you clearly arent familiar with
GetMotivated,removed,usually those people are just grandstanding themselves like the straight white guy who thinks hes cool repeating sjw phrases about the evils of straight white men somehow unware that hes going around telling people hes a straight white guy what theyre saying doesnt really matter to them they just want to sound like theyre in charge and listened to but its also true that when we work hard we rarely understand the perspective of someone else i worked hard in college to figure out which info was going to be on the test but i had no idea other peoples brains had trouble doing that and they spent all their time studying all the info hoping theyll remember the right stuff my brain is terrible at homework though good at tests bad at homework some other people have it way easier than i do for that i know more than one person in a generation older than me who believe that it was their hard work that got them to where they are well it was had they not worked and slacked off they wouldnt have made it but they also have no idea how much the larger forces and luck played in their success bill gates would not have started microsoft in because computer didnt exist take a bill gates clone and send him forward years and he also would have failed because bill gates already saturated the market with windows meaning bill gates would have no chance of getting into it people being in your face with the attitude are usually seflish and obnoxious but theres no doubt that my uncle who worked hard to make a lot of money benefitted from entering the job market at a time when companies were growing and there was a lot more opportunity for him theres no doubt that my friends dad got rich from smarts hard work and also starting a software company at the right time when there were openings in the market for it and he would not have been able to do that today in the same market regardless of how smart or hard working he was theres no doubt that my dad had an easier time with money because he went to college in an age where he would take a summer job and pay his entire college bill each year theres no doubt that while i had it harder than him that i benefitted from graduating when i could consolidate my student loans near the inflation rate and pay them off slowly rather than being faced with high rates and an even bigger mountain of debt that a lot of people i know who graduated just a few years later had to face theres no doubt that someone graduating today gets paid around the same as i did but has to face much larger rent payments than i did ive seen people who are far lazier than i am coast through because their dad was rich and they could get a job at his company ive seen people who are smarter and harder working than i am fail over and over again while i succeeded just because my brain is better at filtering out the irrelevant information and realizing what bs i needed to say to get by was ive seen others who are less smart and definitely less skilled than i am pass me by and screw over others because theyre better at the corporate politics game of being a two faced passive aggressive douche people are rarely aware of the circumstances that accompany their success even when they do work hard and are smart that without those circumstances they never would have gotten to where they did
GetMotivated,removed,this comic was clearly written by some neckbeard who plays too many video games its also too longwinded
GetMotivated,removed,obviously youre not sorry youre an ignorant asshole im not weakminded im a human being what reassurance doesnt make you feel better give me a break have a nice day
GetMotivated,removed,pff you ignorant figure if women would be equal they would get paid the same wouldnt get shamed if they had sex with more than one man while men get respect for fucking around wouldnt be constantly reduced on their appearance and made to sex objects in our patriarchal society and so on and this comes from a man regarding language of course language is changing how do think we got from indogermanic and latin to english spanish german etc and language is also changing right at this moment every meme every abreviation every acronym like lol contributes to the language and if enough individuals decide that a neologism is worth using someone puts it in a dictionary and it becomes a real word but just know that if you think that dictionaries are the only true and valid source of words you are just following the rules someone put up which had to be done in order to enable humanity to pass on knowledge more efficiently
GetMotivated,removed,shit shitpost every weeks this gets posted and upvoted to the front page its not even good its the equivalent of a hallmark movie just over the top sappy garbage with substance fuck you all
GetMotivated,removed,who said anything about giving up im carrying on and bitching after all whats the point of reddit if not to bitch my point is that for some it doesnt matter how many different ways you try there isnt a way out the idea that you just try hard and everything will be ok just doesnt wash and i think sometimes leads to people making unfair judgments of others i see it loads here in the uk people look at someone who is unemployed using a foodbank or on benefits and make assumptions about their attitude or their willingness to work etc i feel like at least some of that starts with this kind of anyone can make it if they try hard enoughamerican dream type stuff
GetMotivated,removed,the sjws would say stuff about privilege also
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you too mom
GetMotivated,removed,it was definitely rude you called me weakminded on a sub people go to to feel encouraged and motivated why wouldnt i take it to heart especially since this guy is mentioning suicide and using his words to encourage misfits to be themselves its clearly not just a meme with pictures please just take your condescending rude self and get out
GetMotivated,removed,sounds like a twat
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,pretty lame of you to use an image where the authors signature pedro arizpe has been cropped out source httpportsherrycomcomicsoriginstory fuck you op
GetMotivated,removed,i wonder what she was gonna say youre a piece of shit and i always resented you
GetMotivated,removed,as some one who is to lazy to read any thing but whats written in big letters fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,most car accidents happen in most known pathes so we can say that in this case we make mistakes doing absolutely not new things
GetMotivated,removed,this is everything 💜
GetMotivated,removed,she posts on rttotm
GetMotivated,removed,good try picture with text if that is your real name you wanna know what gets me motivated fuck you i wont do what you tell me
GetMotivated,removed,meanwhile the cars behind her are all honking because shes sitting at a green light
GetMotivated,removed,yeah i get you wish i could do something for herbut id keep her connected to the internet internet can interfere with you getting out there that guy made me feel so much betteri just recently went through a break up i havent done much with my life because of that i slowed down i decided i would not be a piece of shit anymore and actually do something so yeah three years stuck in a relationship of shit now i am turning in a week and im still here i am moving to another city where unemployment is not as bad as it is in this part of california which has the highest and try to pay for my own school and teach myself how to code we all just need to do something also if i were in her shoes id be like fuck her and her boyfriend with a pineapple im going to make me some awesome friends put some effort to get out of your little shell of comfort and really strive to put some heavy duty work to make yourself feel happy once again you will never be alone trust me its weird but that is how it works talk to someone you are just over thinking and everything is going to be ok
GetMotivated,removed,id give an arm and a leg to do a single arm pullup
GetMotivated,removed,ill clear up the confusion for her its called upper body strength
GetMotivated,removed,you gotta chicken wing it
GetMotivated,removed,niiiiggggaaaaa
GetMotivated,removed,male privilege
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,but
GetMotivated,removed,gendergapjpg
GetMotivated,removed,he could climb it because of his white male privilege
GetMotivated,removed,oh im sorry did you miss the part where we were talking about the girls reaction theres a girl who watches him so then the conversation devolved into the fact that maybe he has an advantage because he weighs less so then i brought up her stature and yeah that was the conversation glad i could bring you up to speed
GetMotivated,removed,its clearly a sexist wall
GetMotivated,removed,im sure hed appreciate any addition to arms
GetMotivated,removed,im gonna guess a metal leg is heavier than a normal one though
GetMotivated,removed,thats not necessarily true just because you say it for example
GetMotivated,removed,full disclosure i got the initial image from while i cannot confirm if the same puddle is shown in both views i think the temporary suspension of disbelief on perception of authenticity still makes for a nice metaphor
GetMotivated,removed,omg theyre joking you dumb fuck
GetMotivated,removed,there is no such thing as the friend zone but my heart goes out to young fellas who dont know any better ok im sorry but this is not only patently false its patronizing crap the friend zone is where you are if she rejects you but wants to stay friends with you this happens ergo the friend zone exists people using the phrase wrong often for people who havent explicitly rejected them does not negate the existence of the concept quit condescending to those of us who use it correctly
GetMotivated,removed,i think everyone wants some responsibility and some recognition for your work being a dad gives you that in abundance i think the majority of people will take more enjoyment out of that than partying into your some people will always be miserable so fuck them we have two grandmothers that will take her anytime we want a night out you have more to lose as well so you arent going to fuck off at work the stability will surely lead to higher pay in the long run even if i dont want to work hours a week like a single guy might and ya i miss doing coke till am and then waking up to play beer pong the next day but it becomes less and less fun as you get older haha try to get a couple nights a month where i go out with the guys usually play poker sports at a pub build a deck ect best friends parents just offered him to not drink for a year so thats even further dropped my drinking down had a stag last weekend and we just cant party like we used to haha
GetMotivated,removed,no nice behavior is just that nice where things like friendzone enter the equation comes from something anything but nice break it down what is the friendzone as defined by its victims it is the status of relationship critical here where the female enjoys all the benefits of a boyfriend emotionalfinancialsocial support but does not reciprocate emotionally lovefascinationsexy times the very word implies raw deal you put out for her would gladly give her the d but she uses you and doesnt give back the degree of involvement you are contributing so what well for one it demeans the nature of relationship into transaction sex becomes an obligation a debt willingly shouldered by the friendzonee its the new neighbor who always notices odds and ends need doing around your house then one day does the siding lawn and replaces your doormat oh howthoughtful then he hangs around you every time you come home or go outside and though he never says it he doesnt quite let go the idea that you owe him for what he volunteered and gets pissy when you paid the locksmith to change all your locks you know completely unrelated the second and this is where we get into sinister as opposed to lets call it obliging behavior is the passive part nice guys arent nice because they like someone they are nice because it is in service of their desires they dont see you as a person per se but as an object they can either own or not own but they wont admit that and will get pretty pissy if you suggest otherwise because they are nice about it but they are only smiling because in their logic being nice obligates the other person to be nice back and since theyd willingly gladly pork the other party well one good turn deserves another in our friendly neighbor example its finding out he didnt give a fuck about your lawn he really needed the money and so did it without you asking so youd be obliged to throw him a few bucks he was never your neighbor he was looking for a way into your pocketbook generally if someone wants something theyll ask for it some people enjoy the attention of volunteers some people feel pretty worthless and dont ask or have hangups because their last neighbor tilled the garden in august heat unannounced and then passive aggressively slipped the receipt for the rototiller under their door but generally people ask for help and in some cases reciprocate i mean if theyre able and arent slime themselves but nobody anywhere ever wants free shit done that comes with an unspoken unacknowledged bill of sale but weve skipped probably the most important part in favor of snarky analogies its not about the lawn the pocketbook favors willing transactions its about caring about one another if we reduce all human interaction to obligation and prices weve lost something in our ability to view others as anything other than food or threats here is where we stop being people that want the connection with others that begets intimacy and start being creepy assholes that see others as walking sex organs that you have to pretend to like first tldr if someone is hurting and you give a fuck you dont lend a hand only in the hope theyll give a fuck back
GetMotivated,removed,haha piss off you shithead internet tough guy
GetMotivated,removed,i reckon the title of the post is lying the race was over just before the tape and thats just for the winner to celebrate runner in red just being an ass ran through the tape far right runner in light blue probably would have won if the tape was the finish line
GetMotivated,removed,larry is so dumb just take the pickle off its not even a part of who he is its a preserved cucumber fuck too larry
GetMotivated,removed,looks like the sjw movement has planted its flag in this sub
GetMotivated,removed,if you act helpless people are going to treat you like youre helpless if youre helpless youre useless
GetMotivated,removed,some of the motivation posted to this sub would really fuck up a persons life if they actually decided to follow it

GetMotivated,removed,asian racist filthymouthed mother on the right nice caring and pleasant caucasian mother on the left
GetMotivated,removed,wow so condescending and sexist horrible cartoon

GetMotivated,removed,came here to say fuck you to asshole cartoonist and asshole op but looks like yall got that covered ta
GetMotivated,removed,yeah this sub is for people to come make negative comments and bask in other peoples collective negativity misery loves company type of thing probably not good for anyones mental health but whatever i just try to come and offer some positive insight although im probably just stoking the fire
GetMotivated,removed,prestigious degree not much of a contribution to society yeah im pretty glad ignorant asses like you dont get to decide whats important or not the irony of belittling a chosen degreecareer in a thread thats literally about not doing that
GetMotivated,removed,or if you get a better education you wont be as racist as the author in this cartoon
GetMotivated,removed,awww what a lovely racist cartoon
GetMotivated,removed,alright lets rewind this a tad guy and guy start with equal opportunity one becomes a millionaire the other has no savings now they each have a kid did kid do anything to deserve being spoiled by guy riches nope but guy did earn the resources to spoil his son and give him the best he could which includes a trust fund of million dollars yes the kid in the bronx should because the alternative is that parents arent allowed to pass on wealth to their children which is one of the primary drivers of progress and savings in this country how do you prevent kid and kid childhoods from being influenced by their parents wealth you cant unless you simply redistribute the parents wealth so both families have the same amount of money how do you prevent guy from passing his wealth he has authority over to his son a ban on financial gifts and a death tax great now guy is just going to burn all his money on useless stuff before he dies instead of savings it for say grandkid college fund youre still arguing about confiscating or dictating what people do with their wealth youve just jumped a generation to try and make it seem unfair
GetMotivated,removed,he doesnt need your elitist ass saving him
GetMotivated,removed,yeah those two jackasses preaching meanwhile the garbage man is probably wondering what steakhouse to go to or something not oh woe is me i suffer so in this municipal job with benefits
GetMotivated,removed,i dislike both since they both implicitly teach to look down upon that guy just from different perspectives but the mom on the left is so patronizing at least the one on the right makes a plausible argument that the job may not be that fun although i am not sure doing say colonoscopies all day long is any better and how is studying going to make a better place for a trash picker maybe she will invent a robot cheap enough to replace the guy and make him unemployed
GetMotivated,removed,translation the garbage man is incapable of improving his own situation his life can only be made better by our good graces the garbage man is inferior to us one on the right is a jerk one on the left is patronizing
GetMotivated,removed,if you study well youll be able to lead him on and then just fucking throw him away like the piece of shit he is after he gets this close to getting into your pants jesus fuck
GetMotivated,removed,or you know a reverse image lookup the korean language comic predates the english one by a lot also the format of the comic artistic choices etc are all very korean and i think you are at the point of either trolling willful ignorance or just peak irony
GetMotivated,removed,ftfy and who the fuck upvoted this unmotivating piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,if youre so autistic that you dont have the social skills to land a decent job with a college degree thats pathetic
GetMotivated,removed,the compound effect jumpstart your income your life your success hardy darren
GetMotivated,removed,um not to be a buzz kill or anything but even though this might be a good outlook to have at times it doesnt really make much sense even in this context i mean yeah maybe its just as hard for him to do minutes as it is for you to do but its impossible for you to do and really easy for him to do saying that both of you are working hard is a false equivilancy lets say you had to run the mile in at least minutes in order to pass a test he would have an extremely easy time while you would have a very hard time and probably fail
GetMotivated,removed,why good for you getting stoned is so much better than dying of liver cancer

GetMotivated,removed,kinda agree theres some people who are loaded with bills kids to feed other responsibilities and only dream of leaving everything behind dont get me wrong this sub is great for getting some motivation to get realistic tasks done but these posts are just typically rpics material with some nice pictures and a story to tell
GetMotivated,removed,its motivational crap like this that makes idiots think they are more than they really are
GetMotivated,removed,this post is sexist racist patriarchal and misoginistic because it assumes only white males in suits can ever be considered successful

GetMotivated,removed,reference to
GetMotivated,removed,a lot of people in this place come here for motivation however they are so unmotivated or used to being unmotivated that they cannot actually find motivation just from a quote instead they just try to deconstruct quotes and how they dont work in order to justify staying unmotivated atleast this is my speculation and i suffer from the same problem that said you should just look at the quote and take what you can and just move on instead of coming to the comments section to look for circle jerk
GetMotivated,removed,i did once but then it just turned out to be diarrhea that smelled worse than boiled death big splash big smell
GetMotivated,removed,yes its his channel hes been posing as this other account because his main account is banned from getmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,as vomit on their neckbeard already
GetMotivated,removed,oh no my friend you are not alone and you havent gone insane either ive seen it far too much everyone knows youre trying to lose and yet they keep the place stocked with every single thing you dont want to put into your body the snack cakes loads of bread and cheese potato chipsetc the more you want to lose it the more junk food comes up people dont get intimidated when someone tries something new people get intimidated when that new thing starts to show results everyone starts at zero and most people dont get too far past that but when it does start working when you do start to see results and be patient with seeing results youll find people get very very jealous people dont want you to be better than they are they will try all the passive aggressive stuff like making your favorite dishes just jam packed with cheese and sour cream instead of making something healthier that they know you would want to eat to keep some form or not buying as much healthy stuff my only advice is you gotta move out from those people if possible but heres the good newsyoure obviously doing something right youre obviously striking a nerve even if you potentially cant see it yet they already know what will happen if you continue down your path to sexy heres what you do get yourself over to the grocery store and buy your own food you dont have to buy everything under the sun but get yourself some stuff that you can eat when you have one of those cravings you know those cravings where an apple would do just fine but since there arent any apples in the house you settle for potato chips and soda yea take the apple instead you dont need to give yourself a complete new pantry just give yourself somethings you can eat that are healthy when all hell breaks loose dont let em break you you know whats going on now you know the game thats being played time for you to go out and beat them at their own game they bring in hohos and dingdongs you bring apples and oranges they drink soda and beer you stick with unsweetened iced tea and water just remember every good choice you make especially infront of other people will payoff big and they know it sweets man sweets are hard heres what i learned theres basically types of sugar the natural stuff thats found in fruits and stuff and the processed shit we find in candy and soda etc you should try to buy more fruit get some strawberries some bananas raspberries then when you have a hunkering for something sweet pick up a strawberry youll still get some nice sweetness and itll be healthier for you if you continue to do this youll find that you actually lose your taste for processed sugar it becomes weird tasting and you only start to crave the natural sugars found in fruit its the only thing that tastes right same way with fast food the longer you lay off the fast food the more gross it starts to taste and you only want the fresh stuff good luck keep grinding birdies are on the way
GetMotivated,removed,wow this post really motivated me to unsub that is
GetMotivated,removed,unsubscribe

GetMotivated,removed,i know i think i should unsubscribe from this sub the whole thing is just stressful
GetMotivated,removed,i think this sub tends to be populated by a lot of really young people teens and college kids who havent actually experienced any really consequential setbacks failures or disappointments in life when i was younger this sort of fuck it im not going to waste my life mentality was motivating but now after several years of both successes and many failures and disappointments that have had lasting consequences in my life this sort of thing is the very opposite of motivating for me after a certain age and accumulating a certain inevitable amount of disappointment in life what you need to do is to take life less serious and make taking risks and learning new behaviors less of a life or death game its no longer constructive or workable to try and scare yourself into action because youll likely just end up in analysis paralysis anxiety or depression memes like this just serve to fixate your mind on whats gone wrong but the fact is if you live long enough youll always have something to be disappointed about just dont focus on that so much and move on to what you can do from this point in your life onwards
GetMotivated,removed,taking risks and failing is always better than staying stagnant and being safe typical stupid le le le le le redditor enjoy your failure of a life

GetMotivated,removed,yeah they have muscle implants for people with disorders

GetMotivated,removed,this is not wisdom
GetMotivated,removed,no they were definitely rightwing it isnt confusing but the political spectrum we define leftwing rightwing and center is a bit more nuanced than that german facism uses a bit of socialism in its rhetorics and policies but because its an ideology of order and racism it is rightwing that must be pretty confusing because order and racism doesnt define the right much but it does define the extreme right nationalsocialism doesnt really denounce capitalism or tries to change it for the working masses but what do you mean with very left in social policies economically they use a bit of the left indeed but i cant really see leftwing policies could you explain please
GetMotivated,removed,hitler did nothing wrong
GetMotivated,removed,how many fedoras do you own
GetMotivated,removed,how can there be any doubt about the sheer insane pants on head level stupidity of the types of discussions we see going on here the entire thread is devoted to an excerpt from a childrens book whose fundamental goal is so crystal clearly meant to be read as laziness is bad you should be active and set goals for yourself turning into people decrying the sentiment as subtly hidden wagecucking people who on one hand grow indignant at any notion of millennial laziness then swing about and declare that any suggestion to get off your ass once in a while represents wagecuck ist propaganda you have to be a severe fucking moron that shouldnt be allowed to operate any kind of machinery if you cant get the message of the passage and you have to be a special kind of special k cereal if you think that its hiding secret pro or antilabor messages

GetMotivated,removed,i am 😃 to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation five 🎼 years ago a 👍 american in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the emancipation proclamation this momentous decree came as a 👍 beacon light of hope to millions of 👨🏿 slaves who had been seared in the 🔥 of withering injustice it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity but 💯 years later the 👨🏿 still is not free 💯 years later the life of the 👨🏿 is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination 💯 years later the 👨🏿 lives on a 😩 🌴 of poverty in the midst of a vast 🌊 of material prosperity 💯 years later the 👨🏿 is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition in a sense we have come to our nations capital to 💰 a check when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence they were signing a promissory 📝 to which every american was to fall heir this 📝 was a promise that all men yes 👨🏿 men as well as white men would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory 📝 insofar as her citizens of color are 😳 instead of honoring this sacred obligation america has given the 👨🏿 people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the 👍 vaults of opportunity of this nation so we have come to 💰 this check — a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the 🚨 of justice we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism now is the time to make real the promises of democracy now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood now is the time to make justice a reality for all of gods 👶 it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment this sweltering summer of the 👨🏿s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating 🍂 of freedom and equality nineteen sixtythree is not an end but a beginning those who hope that the 👨🏿 needed to blow off steam and will now be 😌 will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the 👨🏿 is granted his citizenship rights the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges but there is something that i must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the ☕️ of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high ✈️ of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the 👨🏿 community must not lead us to distrust of all white people for many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny and their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom we cannot walk alone as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead we cannot turn back there are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights when will you be satisfied we can never be satisfied as long as the 👨🏿 is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of 👮‍♀️ brutality we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies heavy with the fatigue of travel cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities we can never be satisfied as long as a 👨🏿 in mississippi cannot vote and a 👨🏿 in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote no no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of 👍 trials and tribulations some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of 👮‍♀️ brutality you have been the veterans of creative suffering continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive go back to mississippi go back to alabama go back to south carolina go back to 🇬🇪 go back to louisiana go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed let us not wallow in the valley of 😩 i say to you today my friends so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream i have a dream that ☝️ day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equal i have a dream that ☝️ day on the red hills of 🇬🇪 the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream that ☝️ day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice i have a dream that my four little 👶 will ☝️ day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the 😌 of their character i have a dream today i have a dream that ☝️ day down in alabama with its vicious racists with its governor having his 👄 dripping with the words of interposition and nullification ☝️ day right there in alabama little 👨🏿 boys and 👨🏿 girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers i have a dream today i have a dream that ☝️ day every valley shall be exalted every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together this is our hope this is the faith that i go back to the south with with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of 😩 a 💎 of hope with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood with this faith we will be able to work together to pray together to struggle together to go to jail together to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free ☝️ day this will be the day when all of gods 👶 will be able to 🎶 with a new meaning my country tis of thee sweet land of liberty of thee i 🎶 land where my fathers died land of the pilgrims pride from every mountainside let freedom 💍 and if america is to be a 👍 nation this must become true so let freedom 💍 from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshire let freedom 💍 from the mighty mountains of new york let freedom 💍 from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania let freedom 💍 from the snowcapped rockies of colorado let freedom 💍 from the curvaceous slopes of california but not only that let freedom 💍 from 💎 mountain of 🇬🇪 let freedom 💍 from lookout mountain of tennessee let freedom 💍 from every hill and molehill of mississippi from every mountainside let freedom 💍 and when this happens when we allow freedom to 💍 when we let it 💍 from every village and every hamlet from every state and every 🌃 we will be able to speed up that day when all of gods 👶 👨🏿 men and white men jews and gentiles protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and 🎶 in the words of the old 👨🏿 spiritual free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at last

GetMotivated,removed,fat cow alert
GetMotivated,removed,lol im so glad the economy has improved so coffee stand girls are hot again and are no longer fat middle aged women
GetMotivated,removed,lack of care is empathetic emptiness which has a tendency to affect the happiness of others around you which has a tendency to come back around to you if you cared about others already the choice would be obvious if you cared about yourself you might be satisfied to learn that in helping the group you also help yourself as part of the group it seems that no matter how you cut it empathy is worth the time to learn and maintain for the sake of yourself others and posterity
GetMotivated,removed,thats honestly what this sub has turned into people trying to give themselves an ego boost by nitpicking at these quotes
GetMotivated,removed,the rest of us who have to clean up after you thats who bunch of damn babyboomers up in this thread istg
GetMotivated,removed,you guys are all missing the point it says how to win at life and has the condition that you must let people do what makes them happy as well so if you enjoy taking happiness away from others than you didnt follow the rule and you lose at life as it says
GetMotivated,removed,so dont be a sjw
GetMotivated,removed,not sustainable high maintenance even if it were legal and available everywhere youd need to keep taking it all the time or youd feel like shit if supply were suddenly interrupted youd be dealing with the shits cold sweats feeling like dying miserable i wouldnt touch that shit if i was paid to even if i could have a lifetime supply it might surprise you but i hate what opiates do to my brain they make me complacent they make me not care about anything and turn me into a blissfully ignorant twat they also make me arrogant and can trigger a pretty nasty rage oxycodone can do that especially if alcohol is consumed afterwards much worse than nicotine in my eyes and i vape and know the difference also opiates destroy my sex drive almost completely i would literally have to force an orgasm and its not even enjoyable i dont know why anyone would bother with them they arent that effective for chronic pain either as evidenced by recent research cannabis is much better for chronic pain and nausea opiates tend to make chronic pain and nausea worse ive seen it many times in my nearly years of living
GetMotivated,removed,be a middle or upper class white male the end

GetMotivated,removed,yes parking my car on my lawn makes me happy why cant my fucking neighbors fuck off and stop calling the city to send bylaw officers over to my door
GetMotivated,removed,this assumes that other people arent complete shitheads
GetMotivated,removed,i do this with romantic relationships and the hypocritical assholes sure do get butthurt
GetMotivated,removed,i understand you have told yourself it is just as effective but that is likely something you say compensate for your weakness and inability to be genuine rather than it objectively being just as effective which it very likely is not however fake it till you make it may be a beneficial route for you and similar people but the goal is still to make it in this sense to learn empathy
GetMotivated,removed,it being intentional or not doesnt change anything imo the road to hell and all that

GetMotivated,removed,just make a little search and quickly youll find shit that debunks your thesis honestly you should take your own advice most of what you said here was second hand at best and guessing and is refuted by simply looking at the song credits people who write songs with other wellknown stars are almost always going to be very gracious about them why would they not so just because they said some kind words like wow theyre so great such a great writer doesnt mean much especially considering the platitudes of other garbage that is out currently and that some of them wrote sorry your diatribe here proves little

GetMotivated,removed,perhaps but you also have to try to understand the issue from a nuanced perspective it gave some insights into the perspectives of a rapist and showed just how mundane the justifications are but at the same time all of those rapists were getting positive validation for their awful actions they were being told they were completely in the right yes that girl did owe them sex because they bought her dinner yes that girl shouldnt have flirted with you if she didnt want it yes shes dating you so you are entitled to force her or yes men cant control themselves yes men are rabid animals who will fuck you at the slightest provocation so its not your fault thats just the way guys are there are a few studies that show that rapists believe that all men are secretly rapists and that theyre just submitting to what all men feel this sort of thread that gives them the proof that this is true that they are in fact justified that gives people who are reading the thread the feeling that this is true that if a girl went with them for a date she owes them a fuck and theyre not wrong if they take forcefully

GetMotivated,removed,its difficult that your campus is known for being depressing but that doesnt mean that is the reality for all people and it certainly doesnt need to be for you figure out a routine where you get your classesclass work done on campus and then leave living at home to go do more fulfilling things afterwards or if youre living there just realize its going to be bleak and work towards your transfer stop comparing yourself to everyone whos ahead of you it offers no value given the way youre looking at it and if youre doing that then to be fair you need to consider all of the people behind you as wellyour problems are nothing to scoff at but dude its going to be fine if you keep pushing away your shit and never tackle it itsnot going ot be okay youre going to be very very unhappy and stressed and cycle further into a shitty state just start growing up and get your shit done regarding your majorfocus i can speak to finance it would provide you with a strong analytical background and is definitely a valuable degree if youre interested in it accounting is important to get exposure to if you plan on pursuing a career in finance do research dude go online and read about various job paths within each of those areas and think about what seems enjoyable go on linkedin and read analyst job descriptions until you find one that sparks your interest stop making excuses and get shit done trust me i get it im about to move cross country have a racist family asian girlfriend taking an exam in june uncertain job future with current employereveryone has their fair share but your problems arent going anywhere and no one is going to solve them for you so i suggest you figure out how to start tackling them or at least wearing them down its your life and you need to figure out what you want it to be one way or another

GetMotivated,removed,why are people so biased against shen its a hilarious and ridiculous circlejerk the idea of an artist exploring an idea with several works in succession is basically the goddamn definition of classical art the speed and ease at which the majority of the comics community rose against shen for exploring this fun trope was amazing and very sad maybe if they spent even a tiny fraction of their lives working towards something like mastering an art then they would be able to understand and appreciate a small scale study of a particular idea style or trope

GetMotivated,removed,point and counter point perhaps it was the exact wording that brought you to this post try kind of racist shit roald dahl said back in the day

GetMotivated,removed,noone said that the texts by roald dahl were any less good because of his believes uqocop implied it with and a noted antisemite the question is was he i dont know maybe maybe the whole world was more racist during his lifetime the things people have pointed out as proof simply sound like observations that jews had an ingroup preference and were less generous in some way to outgroup people that is true of most groups and implies no malice imo

GetMotivated,removed,he was also quite racist and hated jews there is a trait in the jewish character that does provoke animosity maybe its a kind of lack of generosity towards nonjews he told the new statesman i mean theres always a reason why antianything crops up anywhere even a stinker like hitler didnt just pick on them for no reason
GetMotivated,removed,httpwwwtrollmeimagessaltyspitoonidrinkorangejuiceafteribrushmyteethjpg
GetMotivated,removed,i guess if you want to isolate a part of that statement that is irrelvant to the intent to make the tautalogical point that things happen for reasons its his perogative but i dont see why you need to be searching for that kind of thing in racist statements instead of just saying hey that is wrong and its racist its like saying hey he was right about hitler being a stinker though yes of course why are you changing the subject to that and trying to put slivers of legitimacy to this comment

GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,i think this is more rfunny than this sub
GetMotivated,removed,you stupid fucking bitch
GetMotivated,removed,you know what you summed up exactly how i feel about this sub every front page post is either a picture of text or something not motivational if i want to get motivated i go on rwatchpeopledie nsfl and realize how much of a gift human life is
GetMotivated,removed,niqqa you thought that was a wilderbesst haha
GetMotivated,removed,but if you are not finding the perfect match than you are in advance setting yourself up to a ticking time bomb until those imperfections will start grinding you after years till you break up wasted time and regret other alternative for weak people is compromise when both are mostly unhappy and accustomed with one another that you transform into each others bad habit you cant give up and instead spend all your time bitching about your relationship
GetMotivated,removed,suck it up harambes christ
GetMotivated,removed,thank you for making the post that was so stupid i finally got motivated to unsubscribe from this shitty sub sorry your mom got fucked by so many people
GetMotivated,removed,i hate this sub with a burning passion
GetMotivated,removed,this motivates me to unsubscribe to this shitty sub
GetMotivated,removed,i have to prove that one douchebag wrong from that one website a few years back okay a lot of years back one day and hopefully theyre not dead from old agebut one day theyll seetheyll see they were wrong joking aside i do hope to have a book and put in the acknowledgements passive aggressiveness about certain people word it just right so that if ever and they probably never will read it theyll know its about them
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think people think about me only want the best for me to unsubscribe from this shitty sub unsubscribed
GetMotivated,removed,dperession isnt feeling sad or demotivated its a mental illness that is unlikely to go away without therapy andor medication it incenses me when people act like depression is just sadness and that support from some altruistic samaritan is the cure no fuck you thats christian science bullshit and you need your mouth sewn shut and your fingers cut off so you dont harm anyone with your made up pseudoscience
GetMotivated,removed,oh fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,damnit this sub is shit
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you this isnt how it works at all
GetMotivated,removed,im from rall and not subscribed here but i subscribed just so i could unsubscribe
GetMotivated,removed,it isnt supposed to this jackass came across the gif and posted it in the sub he thought would give him the most karma
GetMotivated,removed,always wondered why this sub never worked for me i do know now
GetMotivated,removed,says a terrorist who killed innocent people
GetMotivated,removed,its probably just that im a massive twat and tell people too much
GetMotivated,removed,he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was one of the activists unsuccessfully prosecuted in the treason trial influenced by marxism he secretly joined the south african communist party sacp although initially committed to nonviolent protest in association with the sacp he cofounded the militant umkhonto we sizwe in and lead a sabotage campaign against the government httpsenwikipediaorgwikinelsonmandela umkhonto we sizwe abbreviated as mk zulu for spear of the nation was the armed wing of the african national congress anc cofounded by nelson mandela in the wake of the sharpeville massacre httpsenwikipediaorgwikiumkhontowesizwe nelson mandela was a terrorist who ordered terrorist acts which killed hundreds of innocent people and government officials he is also wrongly remembered for making south africa a better place to live and although he ended apartheid his organizations attempt at warding off colonialismimperialism has resulted in a much worse society than before unemployment violent crime and rape have all skyrocketed after apartheid along with many other statistics that have caused south africas incompetency on the world stage you should learn history before you put up a quote from a wellknown terrorist on rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,what a shitpost
GetMotivated,removed,thats basically every post in this sub
GetMotivated,removed,maybe httpswwwredditcomrfitness
GetMotivated,removed,it is all about perspective like how the media portrays him as some great civil rights leader but in truth he was an ignorant terrorist that blamed white people for his problems and in the end reduced south africa to an african run shit hole
GetMotivated,removed,this quote is a lot darker if you look at him as the terrorist he used to be
GetMotivated,removed,motto for all trolls
GetMotivated,removed,i had it saved got you fam
GetMotivated,removed,terrorist racist obamas hero
GetMotivated,removed,putting tires around black peoples necks and setting them on fire was resistance i guess black lives really dont matter
GetMotivated,removed,itt a load of people who have come literally only to shit on mandelas legacy of a nonapartheid south africa what a fucking shit show to some extent i would be open to discussing ambivalence in the character and legacy of mandela the thing is i know that the majority of the people who come here do not want that discussion what makes me wonder is this if your wish was to promote a more balanced debate about the end of apartheid you wouldnt come to this thread and post says the terorrist if you come here and do that its either one of two reasons or both you just want to be edgy and thats a good enough reason for you to call mandela nothing but a terrorist or whatever you have a larger revisionist agenda that gives you an interest to depict antiapartheid activism in a negative light
GetMotivated,removed,be careful thats racist
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you and your gameplan nelson mandela
GetMotivated,removed,i never lose i either terrorize or youre a racist
GetMotivated,removed,how is ending a racist murdering regime a negative thing he saw the error of his ways and ended using fear tactics decades ago
GetMotivated,removed,because he helped end a racist system of law
GetMotivated,removed,our local hs football team learned about losing to our rivals
GetMotivated,removed,the safety law and order and utilities of south africa for black people were lightyears behind the conditions for white people in sa the argument that people of the same skin colour in other countries live worse applies no more in south africa than it does in the united states it is bleak racism equal citizenship means equal citizenship not european standards of living for white people and african standards of living for black people in reality the biggest problem was that the ideological promise of keeping ethnic groups separate wasnt sustainable you cant both keep bantu people in their homelands and require their labour near the white urban centres the wealth of south africa was being produced black people as much as white but it was decided over and consumed by whites this is the part that eventually blew up now we could discuss some of the effects of immigration but not if youre using it as a smokescreen for apartheid apologism the main problem in apartheid south africa was the destructive and in practical terms untenable ideology of apartheid
GetMotivated,removed,by butchering black people and lighting them on fire but at least we got to start genociding whitey afterwards so thats kinda cool
GetMotivated,removed,love getting motivated by a racist terrorist fuck i hope ill have a chance to piss on his grave in my life
GetMotivated,removed,dae think butchering black people isnt that big of a deal blm
GetMotivated,removed,some proper fucking idiots in this thread
GetMotivated,removed,i wish they would the gunless lefties would be busy dealing with real oppression instead of talking about my people like theyre dogs on the internet
GetMotivated,removed,your people deserve to be blown up
GetMotivated,removed,kill yourself cracker
GetMotivated,removed,he never said this god this sub is full of shit
GetMotivated,removed,then again those that come here are probably looking for motivation and are already highly unmotivated angry bitter or many other things already so their negativity is voiced theres a lot of good stuff on reddit too rbodyweightfitness are two subs where i can say the comments are actually all pretty great either informative or encouraging or critical of the content because they disagree with the advice given and such it is a pity how negative most of the comments in this sub are mostly in the vein of why this doesnt apply to my specific case entirely and you suck for putting this up like if it doesnt apply to you then it doesnt nothing applies to everyone
GetMotivated,removed,absolutely not there are so many things particular to the entertainment industry that their advice is meaningless especially ones that have been acting since they were a child and are now middle aged the right look the right sound connections etc im sure they work hard in their own way but still
GetMotivated,removed,its a little rambling it skips from worries to failures to relationships without giving any real advice
GetMotivated,removed,anyone find this video hard to watch and read the words and graphics are too quick
GetMotivated,removed,bullshit i trolled you didnt i
GetMotivated,removed,rmelanietrumpnudes nsfw
GetMotivated,removed,stay ignorant in order to live happily
GetMotivated,removed,wtf is going on with this sub this isnt motivational at all and extremely edgy
GetMotivated,removed,i dont understand this sub some one posts something to get ppl motivated then people post comments trying to bash the post i guess the best way to get motivated is to not read the comments
GetMotivated,removed,i feel like this sub is for depressed people with money not real people with real problems
GetMotivated,removed,thank you this sub is so trite
GetMotivated,removed,i can see some dumb teenager reading this and thinking guess im ready to drive on the freeway by myself hugh laurie is a great multitalented man but this advice sounds like it was written by bazooka joe
GetMotivated,removed,there are days i wish i could go back to being the ignorant happy guy on the left
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,or starting a family in middle school
GetMotivated,removed,after thinking about this a bit i have concluded that there are many more scenarios where this is awful advice than scenarios where it is good advice
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is literaly worse than facebook
GetMotivated,removed,dont forget to also have wealthy parents and go to eton and then cambridge and while at cambridge make sure you join an elite drama group where most british theatre and movie stars began their careers hugh
GetMotivated,removed,rredpill
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is more philosophy than motivation
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is trash
GetMotivated,removed,you mean play video games
GetMotivated,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
GetMotivated,removed,what this sub wont tell you is that if you are incurably ugly you will not find love
GetMotivated,removed,i really hate this know yourself business not because its not good advice but because people take it the wrong way they take that as accepting their fixable flaws and for god knows why only keeping to a simple cycle of activies that wont change never trying or expanding their view oh herr durr leon whos to say whats the wrong way me its fucking wrong and disgusting to just sit there on your fat ass thinking your hot shit and the rest of the world is shit when youre part of the problem you mother fucker
GetMotivated,removed,i thought positive comments were not what we do here in this sub
GetMotivated,removed,why didnt you stand up for me and tell that waiter they got my order wrong why would you say anything i dont wanna cause a fuss either way
GetMotivated,removed,wow you sound like a piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,nice try not falling for your weak trolls
GetMotivated,removed,i want to share some helpful information to consumers that has help me re establish my credit and improve my credit scores i had a low credit score until i got professional help
GetMotivated,removed,yea understood all that again great story but doesnt really translate to everyday life and the idea of selfmotivation
GetMotivated,removed,unless you are in a situation that requires you to read
GetMotivated,removed,we all know why its gone downhill since apartheid nobody has the courage to acknowledge the reason in this day and age plus itll get you banned
GetMotivated,removed,take your racism back to r thedonald kid
GetMotivated,removed,the problem is if i believe in this ill start falling down just to get back up
GetMotivated,removed,but live in a way that begs the least criticism to your character fuck that piss off as many people as you can
GetMotivated,removed,mandela is definitely not the person to look up to a racist terrorist who fucked up his country
GetMotivated,removed,did you just read that in the voice of morgan freeman racist
GetMotivated,removed,white people out black people cant run the country voila modern day africa
GetMotivated,removed,he is a fucking terrorist
GetMotivated,removed,you said modern day africa as in the whole continent are you saying that subsaharan african people cant run the country or that just these specific black persons cant do it
GetMotivated,removed,its been hours did you kill yourself yet
GetMotivated,removed,therapistcom
GetMotivated,removed,but this sub is filled with inspiration written by others to incorporate into your story
GetMotivated,removed,httpwwwtrollmeimageschrishansenwhydontyouhaveaseatrightovertherethumbjpg
GetMotivated,removed,i always looked up to my father when i was growing up last week he turned and i beat the shit out of him
GetMotivated,removed,you just copy and pasted one of the top answers from rfitness about how professionals find time to work out go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,thanks obama
GetMotivated,removed,i agree with and your post is selfdefeating i used to stay up past sometimes just skipping sleeping all together it builds up in your body and you become depressed you also miss out on the entire morning when the rest of the world is awake and sendinganswering your emails when you wake up at its not like you snap into work mode you have to get dressed eat breakfast and do whatever else you do so you probably dont even get going until noon and thats hours after people started to work plus those people after lunch are now looking forward to going home and putting off anything you need from them until the next day in their mind attitudes like yours are what makes people that come to this sub to become inspired fall off the wagon you dont need to be disciplined to be successful idiots win the lottery every day but it helps a hell of a lot to train yourself to be responsible for your own actions instead of staying up and sleeping in
GetMotivated,removed,not rkeming they explicitly ban photoshopped content
GetMotivated,removed,youre not bursting my bubble so dont worry about that youre just being an asshole to someone who wrote something motivational and im calling you out and youre on reddit in this sub writing condescending comments hahaha ok
GetMotivated,removed,just another reason to unsub from rgetmotivated its clickbait
GetMotivated,removed,i can see michael phelps on the tippy top of the glacier acting like a douche bag
GetMotivated,removed,its doesnt matter what he looks like he still loves you non of our generation has seen him
GetMotivated,removed,lets try this
GetMotivated,removed,hi getmotivated this is more of a question of motivation of another tonight a friend of mine posted a status asking for reasons not to commit suicide ive never been super close with this person but i know theyve had it rough and i do care about them so whats the best response to that sort of question is there any popular post from this board that would help in this situation
GetMotivated,removed,nothing in this sub has ever given me the slightest motivation
GetMotivated,removed,god the reposts are getting much more frequent for this sub
GetMotivated,removed,instructions on how to be a selfish prick
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is fucking weird
GetMotivated,removed,the issue is many ignorant people seem to believe that minor and moderate anxiety exist and being confident can help it but somehow crippling exhaustive anxiety is just an exaggeration and can be dealt with the same way i wonder if these people would tell a cancer patient to just snap out of it
GetMotivated,removed,i posted this yesterday in rdrugs and thought it was also appropriate for this sub these were realizations that i felt i had made after my first mushroom trip i myself wanted to write them down to keep in my wallet as a reminder for myself of things i should be constantly doing and i hope it may be of some value to some people in here rgetmotivated has been such an awesome resource for me and i thank this community for being what it is and displaying the positivity and motivation we all need wishing you all the best have a kick ass weekend feel free to read onto to extended versions of these points my trip made me think about the countless people in my life that have helped make me the person i am today i spend so much time trying to make everyone in my life happy and many are not deserving of my time and they take me away from giving that time to those that matter it made me reflect on and realize that i need to be more aware about the people in my life and freakin appreciate those that are important to me this one probably hit me the most and i realized how lucky i am lucky just to breath and have life on this incredible place lucky for all of the friends and family that have helped make me who i am lucky to have been raised in a positive nurturing household and all the values and beliefs i have received lucky for the education i have received and the perspective this education and my life has given me i could go on forever but this trip made me more appreciative for my life than ive ever been for those who are depressed or upset at their life i encourage them to take some of the magic fungi and go hangout near a creek for a while will do more for you than any therapist or so i believe a waste to be constantly concerned with others opinions trusting in yourself isnt easy but its necessary we cant spend our time constantly trying to make others happy before ourselves be selfish in the sense that you are the most important part of your life we cant do anything if we dont believe in who we are and what we stand for believe in who you are and trust in your intuition i believe there is a part of us that tries to guide us to betterment when we ignore that we are ignoring ourselves i had recently decided to not pursue grad school because my heart wasnt in it and a part of me was telling me to devote that time to something i am more passionate about this experience certainly reaffirmed the decision i had made choose where you spend your time and attention wisely people spend so much time distracted by nonsense whether it be politics sports television etc what if they spent that time into bettering themselves and the world around them dont get me wrong distractions can be great but dont let them define your life and what you think about huge takeaway from this trip for me i have had and will continue to have many things in my life that hold me back from fulfilling my full potential i have lied to myself countless times saying these things are not bad just like i am sure many people have and i have to stop doing that being consciously aware of the things you shouldnt be doing will hopefully influence you to stop doing them itll be a tragedy if i let all the potential i have be held back by stupid bad habits and i look forward to constantly reflecting and bettering myself holy shit something i imagine shrooms do for a lot of people i was in the most incredible freakin place for this trip and this experience gave me the most appreciation for the world around me i have ever have there is so much beauty in everything around us and though we do a shitty job at doing it its our responsibility to take care of this paradise what if every person had the goal to leave this place better than when they arrived while its easy to be pessimistic about how we as humans have ruined the world around us this place is still magnificent get out enjoy connect with the world and maybe try to influence someone else to do the same also put a smiley face here because a fucken frog sat in front of me and smiled at me for a good minutes our bodys are incredible in all that they enable us to do and its our responsibility to respect them i mean respect our bodies in every sense brushing our teeth putting the right nutrients this into our body staying active etc more importantly i have wrote this as a reminder to not become complacent once we start to go through the motions and those motions dont consist of taking care of ourselves we are doing ourselves a huge injustice be aware and stay aware of your everyday life and the small things you can do to stay energetic to stay active and to stay confident in who you are wont ever be able to be happy or free if we are constantly scared or afraid of life around us take that risk to be better even if it has a possible negative consequence fly in that plane even if of people die from flying in a plane go up to that girl and introduce yourself even if oh no she might not be into you relate this to number i believe being constantly scared of things around us is the biggest detriment to many peoples lives and it undoubtedly holds them back be courageous be tough and go for whatever it is you want to go for hoorah so many of us spend our lives being prisoners to ourselves when we dont have to be we should do everything we can to live the life we want even if its a tough road or it seems impossible whats worse than trying to live your life how you want and failing is being trapped in a life you dont want we have been blessed with the opportunity to live so why do so many not take advantage of that i encourage you to make the most out of your life positively influence those around you be passionateengaged in whatever you do and enjoy yourself along the way do shrooms
GetMotivated,removed,and then you cant take it anymore and kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,i can say i havent been woken by a cock before maybe if i get a boyfriend p
GetMotivated,removed,you guys in this sub arent depressed enough to understand the comic
GetMotivated,removed,damn this makes me want to be the next moonkeh
GetMotivated,removed,i met simone a couple years ago super nice girl we got breakfast and then that girl sucked my dick and then started blowing balloons up with her farts actually pretty cool to see in person shes very talented
GetMotivated,removed,your an elf
GetMotivated,removed,i think its kinda funny that we would be applauding her if the narrative were different like if she were looking up to those athletes aka wanting to be like them instead of someone like kim kardashian or some other useless twat
GetMotivated,removed,you know i read a lot of cheesy shit on this sub and this is one that really actually gets me motivated
GetMotivated,removed,in the fictional world it is a flaw
GetMotivated,removed,who is she fastest tree climber
GetMotivated,removed,its not it portrays childish arrogance instead
GetMotivated,removed,she still aint no kanye doe
GetMotivated,removed,yes they can ive accepted that i have a small dick but that doesnt mean women are going to like it theyll still reject you and tell all their friends that youre worthless
GetMotivated,removed,i like to fuck kids
GetMotivated,removed,this should be on rshort as well
GetMotivated,removed,it doesnt matter if im okay with my dick being okay with a small dick isnt going to make women like it its not going to hit deep stretch her out or allow for positions that are physically impossible with a small dick but fine with a normal dick other peoples reactions have everything to do with it almost no one is going to be happy being alone thinking theyre great when no one else thinks so its complete bull shit that people dont care about what others think of them
GetMotivated,removed,jesus this sub has gotten bad
GetMotivated,removed,dicks out for harambe
GetMotivated,removed,ibanezmelon
GetMotivated,removed,your mom deserves to be shit on
GetMotivated,removed,so whenever someone tells me like youre ugly i immediately respond so did you like the deadpool movie am i doing it right
GetMotivated,removed,i prefer the version my mother told me when i was a kid once youve accepted your flaws killing yourself will be much easier
GetMotivated,removed,this doesnt work so well for video games
GetMotivated,removed,blaze it faggot edward stark
GetMotivated,removed,except you know if said weakness is physical
GetMotivated,removed,michael scott
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,yeah well you know what fuckoff you win the quote is dumb i dont care im still gonna use end and ending to mean different things
GetMotivated,removed,rough guess that for one good motivational post you have to endure four cheesy posts that intend to appeal to the average facebook user one down three to come it seems stay strong people just like everyday efforts this sub fails and fails just to occasionally strike gold
GetMotivated,removed,if this shakes you to your core then good luck living
GetMotivated,removed,my dog died today its the end its not ok fuck you john
GetMotivated,removed,john lennon is a twat and a hypocrite

GetMotivated,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of when a performer or speaker intentionally dropsthrows the microphone on the floor after an awesome performance president obama this past weekend addressed the congressional black caucus and told them to stop complaining stop grumbling stop crying and help him fix the economy and get reelected though im not sure if the mic drop was necessary httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something
GetMotivated,removed,so corny so it corny it makes me want to die

GetMotivated,removed,yeah ill be sure to tell my friend with treatmentresistant depression to get over it with their own willpower its not like its a chemical imbalance in the brain or anything this sub is garbage
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,this post is downright terrifying ableist the whole deal i am writing the mods and would suggest everyone else to do the same depression is a serious disability which untreated can lead to death it is not the blues this sub should not be giving medical device
GetMotivated,removed,an oxymoron even
GetMotivated,removed,dude fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,oh no you had to pay for college yourself stupid reddit baby
GetMotivated,removed,people dont like it when youre different and as a result i was picked on and people actually fought with me even though i never initiated anything correction americans usually white or black americans dont like asians because asians work harder than everyone else and as a result asians are picked on and people actually believe asians are pushovers and weaklings thanks to racist stereotypes asians are bullied the most in school already proven multiple times
GetMotivated,removed,not gonna lie i thought the troll post was pretty funny tbh
GetMotivated,removed,i think it just means that if there is a barrier in your way you now have to work towards getting past that barrier if there is a barrier in your way go through that barrier
GetMotivated,removed,please suicide
GetMotivated,removed,agreed most of these comments are just a big circle jerk nobody paid for your college oh my sweet feathery jesus the cruelty

GetMotivated,removed,i just call it as i see it and youre it
GetMotivated,removed,and im pointing out that it takes a weak mind to be seduced by hatred for other people but quelle surprise a weak mind didnt understand my statement
GetMotivated,removed,well i identify more with neotraditionalist ethnostatism
GetMotivated,removed,what percentage of your local community eg town is white
GetMotivated,removed,tell them they should stop lying to your face noone feels like listening to someone who accuses them of lying we must make some accusations but that kind of verbal aggression will alienate potential allies be very careful about who you say that to ignorant but nonmalicious people should get a thats not right as opposed to a stop lying to my face save that shit for the incorrigibles
GetMotivated,removed,i doubt that any city in the west is black unless you mean somewhere in africa what do you mean by white flight suburbia i havent heard that term before did you have any nonwhite friends growing up
GetMotivated,removed,segregated communities are the perfect breeding ground for racism as it allows people to assume that other races are lesser without getting to know them i wonder what your best friend thinks about your views and if you think they are lesser for not being white
GetMotivated,removed,my mom has cancer and is about to die my father already died from cancer recently i was caught possessing drugs and i was fined a lot though iwas free of jail time my mother has not heard of my wrongdoing and i dont want her last memory of me to be corrupt she would blame herself and feel extremely sad although our relationship has always been secret less im very confused now should i or should i not tell her

GetMotivated,removed,well not having pity i would say is a good thing i wouldnt advise to pity anyone but if a good friend came to you and said that they messed up doing something and they are a bad person for doing it would you say yeah your pretty much a piece of shit or would you say well we all make mistakes etc and have compassion for them
GetMotivated,removed,yea another muslim no doubt
GetMotivated,removed,you can be the bravest man in the world what was that story about that military man who stood up in a firefight claiming the enemy could not hit him a few seconds later he gets shot in the mouth karma or irony just because your brave does not give you to excuse to be a damned jackass think before you act general grant was a notorious alcoholic who would command while stinking drunk he may have become president but how many men had to die without the benefit of good strategy under his watch i believe he had the highest causality rating in the war
GetMotivated,removed,call this guy he will tell you a joke and you will laugh for days unless you want really brutal insults too you wont regret it let loose my friends hes lonely

GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,thats a broad brush youre using to tar and feather me since youre the one who apparently has no reading comprehension skills id say its you that has the mediocre life and shitty attitude
GetMotivated,removed,they should have pokemon everywhere not just in heavily populated areas i cant believe idiots pay a day for this shit either its pixels
GetMotivated,removed,i gotta agree this success story pisses me off a little because people dont need to be motivated by stories of incremental success they need to be motivated by stories of perseverance through lots of failure failing is what will break motivation and will to continue not having small or in this case pretty enormous successes piling up along the way i think the most motivating thing about this was actually the last paragraph about not knowingworrying about what final form your success will actually take but just focusing on the next level up and incrementally gaining skills knowledge and partners along the way
GetMotivated,removed,itt easily butthurt ingress players
GetMotivated,removed,ladies love his john hanke cock
GetMotivated,removed,ok now please improve scalability so i can actually log into the game
GetMotivated,removed,you are just not as in the loop as you think more like an echo chamber of stagnant gaming industry bs congratz on being ignorant ingress was a world wide hit played by millions and it is still played today every pogo stop was an ingress portal submitted by people playing ingress notice all the pogo stops and thats only a portion of the ingress portals your statement is illogical and wrong you are not as smart as you think you are
GetMotivated,removed,the consensus on this sub seems to be that if you dont find a particular post motivational its because youre a sad loser wholl never amount to anything i think some users tend to project their insecurities on anyone who criticises a piece of poor quality content
GetMotivated,removed,stolen from rentrepreneur
GetMotivated,removed,while still impressive the original game was much like many of the time meridian took clear inspiration from other videogames visually and mechanically this not including the rpg elements taken from table top games that are exclusively played with others the developer probably just wanted to be able to play games like dnd over the net with far away real life or internet friends then he realized the lucrative opportunity he was in with the success of other recent nonrpg online games here is the original trailer troll rageaccurately disclaimer the second paragraph is merely speculation and i have not significantly research this developers motives if others have successfully i would love to here what his interest or motives behind the game were since he is bound to be doing interviews soon we will probably figure out what they were this is considering that he will likely be a popular public figure in the gaming industry
GetMotivated,removed,rhowtonotgiveafuck
GetMotivated,removed,pokemon go semicolon the game everyone loves but no ones plays coma two ms keep going its gine those mistakes get blushed out enter now say if you truly loved pokemon you would play the game but the way i see it you never loved the pokemon you only loved killing your friends guess you wont get how about get rid of get and just say well woops end it here before it gets worse period
GetMotivated,removed,finally omg ive been waiting so long for this message finallyyy i can go outside and excercise man why did it take so long to realize that i just never cared woops did i just tell you the secret to getting better eh probably
GetMotivated,removed,basically he made ingress not that many people interested basically same game but now all portals are poke stops and random wepons are now pokemon omg best game ever massive success i agree this game was not years in the making he just happened to be in the right place at the right time in the right jobs lots of people make amazing cool things few are lucky enough to be brought up by google and developed into google maps resulting in such an incredible career makes his dream geo games and tbh whilst not a total flop as it was kinda popular it was nothing amazing in terms of popularity it is literally a story of some hard work shittons of luck and then piggybacking off one of the most popular franchises in history to the top i dont find this motivating at all this story would be incredibly different if google hadnt brought up keyhole and he would end up like millions of others out there im not saying people shouldnt try but this sub trys to give unrealistic expectations of things like this look this guy went from nothing to most popular game in the world with just hard work you can too this is an extreme case of right place right thought right time very close to the start of his story
GetMotivated,removed,lol took jesus say yars oh well maybe it wasnt such a success afterall when his minion rape the childen of teh earth and plant seeds o its nice to think that america has grown into such a nice country with the strong base or maybe it was just the constituin all along and all the new laws are the reason for degradation add a period here and then say dance mutherfuqqers
GetMotivated,removed,we shouldve noticed earlier that this guy is clearly a troll
GetMotivated,removed,no i wouldnt if youre a pogo player you can flip between the two fairly easily lots of new peeps are being exposed and started playing the community is still plenty active but i will admit its a huge commitment and fairly easy to get burned out on give it a try but it may not be for you
GetMotivated,removed,serious question what kind of people are you hanging out with if you are constantly told you cant do something why would you surround yourself with people who put you down all the time what if i have no one to prove wrong because i dont hang out with pricks ive yet to meet a person shitty enough to tell someone they cant do something or theyll never be good enough where are all these assholes people are talking about
GetMotivated,removed,first step lean english

GetMotivated,removed,black people have the stupidest sayings
GetMotivated,removed,i dont know what you just said but also fuck you for saying it
GetMotivated,removed,suck my duck
GetMotivated,removed,no offense but this is the most ridiculous thing ive red on this sub mother told him when he was that the most important thing is to be shredded
GetMotivated,removed,i emailed bills podcast like the day after my wife left me and i felt like my world was falling apart i didnt expect him to read my question but he answered it with a lot of the same stuff here he just included and dont do some stupid shit like get another girlfriend right away you need to work on you and that should be your priority for awhile it was typical bill burr stuff because it was everything i didnt really want to hear but it was the truth and he helped me laugh through some really crappy times even if this is buried i appreciated it
GetMotivated,removed,fucking man childs grow up
GetMotivated,removed,just turned last week quit my fulltime employment in tv to start a business in video production gave up regular pay a crappy pension scheme but a pension scheme nonetheless made a horrible loss last year equipment this year will break even but next year projecting a profit and a very exciting year futon at my parents all my friends and peers have their own place and they talk about how much they hate their jobs i remind myself how much worse it could be and that although it might suck now it could and should and will get better i found this about a year or so ago its been my favourite and my desktop background ever since in fact
GetMotivated,removed,working hard sucks fuck you icp rulz whoooop whoooooop
GetMotivated,removed,turning in feb same just moved into a studio by myself after having a terrible roommate experience who had a livein girlfriend who was a total bitch hated seeing their relationship and having a third roommate who didnt pay i even reported them to the landlord and nothing was done now i live on my own in an awesome little studio in the middle of town minutes from work make my own rules no neighbors or anyone who shares any walls with me so no worrying about noise or keeping it down no one under or above me either i am the king and i have absolutely no desire to get married or even seek out another serious relationship after year or more relationships went down the drain since i was i am single live alone have disposable income and fucking love it fuck marriedliving with your gf life
GetMotivated,removed,well here comes a fuck ton of people covering up all their shitty tattoos with hate so they can get it all removed for free
GetMotivated,removed,at least you know where to aim
GetMotivated,removed,lol fuck off humor is subjective so you dont like it good for you others do move on with your day
GetMotivated,removed,my god even getmotivated is turning to political shitposts
GetMotivated,removed,windows sucks
GetMotivated,removed,the racial genocide part i think
GetMotivated,removed,big difference between a tattoo showing ones allegiance to a murderous fascist and genocidal ideology and ones race you can choose your political beliefs but you cant choose your race
GetMotivated,removed,yes surely this will make all the nazis change their mind about racist nationalism
GetMotivated,removed,so if someone i know has a racist tattoo and i want it removed you will remove it for free
GetMotivated,removed,thanks for destroying my iq im going to fail my semester exams now
GetMotivated,removed,if you or someone you know has a tattoo that is gang or racist related and you want it covered we will cover it for free no questions asked is it the wording or are they insinuating they will forcefully remove tattoos so lets say i find lil waynes face tattoos to look gang related they will cover them for free no questions asked
GetMotivated,removed,and if you dont want our tattoocovering service eg you like your racisthateful tattoo check out our isp involuntary scalping program well cut that shit right off wont that kill me you ask well technically yes but so what its free winwin
GetMotivated,removed,mayb not stuff like that but i totally believe that we as the people should be able to hold politicians accountable for their actions no matter how many years ago if you as a politician stands drunk at party yelling sig heil with your fellow party members that shit needs to be punishable just because the guy says today that he is no longer racist he still implemented a hell of a lot of intolerant laws and if you live in a socialist democratic country and decide to sell big parts of the government owned electricity providercompany to goldman sachs in return for say a great job once your time as politician is done that shit needs to be punishable
GetMotivated,removed,a penis is neither gang related nor racist
GetMotivated,removed,you shoot someone in the back of the head regardless of what racist tattoo you hit itll be pretty difficult to make a self defense plea look at officer michael slager

GetMotivated,removed,women see men like tools resource bags atms once they have what they want they ditch them looking else where for whatever grants them comfort shouldnt be this way
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is ironically extremely negative i think a lot of is expectations people with clinical depression come on here expecting more than a nice motivational message and get pod that theyre not cured
GetMotivated,removed,i read cock
GetMotivated,removed,misread it as cock
GetMotivated,removed,replace clock with cock and this becomes much better
GetMotivated,removed,i read it as everyone have got their own cock and wondered how that was motivational facepalm
GetMotivated,removed,this is fucking stupid and demotivational you dont have a fate if you want something stop waiting for it and make it happen fuck the clock
GetMotivated,removed,more like tedxrdepression d

GetMotivated,removed,heres a sneak peek of rwwoof using the httpsnpredditcomrwwooftopsorttoptall of all time httpimgurcomagwcvh im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
GetMotivated,removed,wow this has to be the worst post ive seen top this sub yes people achieve things at different rates that doesnt mean you shouldnt compare yourself to those on your level who are outpacing you looking at the outliers the best and the worst sure they arent indicative or comparable to your success the whole bit on normalizing infidelity has nothing to do with anything and just looks trashy
GetMotivated,removed,httpswwwredditcomrtitlegore
GetMotivated,removed,i read it as cock not as in adult male chicken and expected sick facts about clitori and stuff kind of disappointed actually
GetMotivated,removed,i read that as cock
GetMotivated,removed,what a load of shit this suggests that the future is set or that there is some sort of fate go ahead believe this tripe and may aswell believe in mythical beings while youre at it
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you ryan for making me feel bad i didnt have my future planned at still kinda dont but fuck you ryan
GetMotivated,removed,i didnt kill myself and i got famous if you dont kill yourself youll get famous too promise totally not empty platitudes
GetMotivated,removed,this sounds like neckbeard
GetMotivated,removed,i also went to college and i did not know many people that think the way you described most had respect for noncollege people i think you are perpetuating a false stereotype of college elitist or need to expand your circle
GetMotivated,removed,holy shit i read that as my professor who selfidentifies as a furry anthro thank goodness i figured that out before i published my bought on it
GetMotivated,removed,why not just rename this sub softlibertarianism and get it over with
GetMotivated,removed,next minute fuck i cant afford it

GetMotivated,removed,i though this was rthathappened for a minute
GetMotivated,removed,if you voted for mr trump you saved the nation
GetMotivated,removed,yes and the safe space thing is completely necessary in early treatment also unless someone is in a lock down in house treatment facility in no way are the people they see in steps their only associates they dont live their rest if their lives in meetings addicts in recovery have families go to work join things etc just like anyone else in no way are you choosing only to associate with a certain kind of person like the statement about choosing company with the same political views might be a good idea for an alcoholic not to hang out in a bar but its a big world people do a lot with their time besides drink and use drugs you can hang with them when they arent doing those things a safe space is not the same as a cocoon
GetMotivated,removed,so almost kill yourself every day but then dont be your own hero
GetMotivated,removed,your comment about perfection being the enemy rings home to me i have always been a perfectionist used to think it was a good thing but over time my obsession with making sure everything was perfect ruined my career and some friendships the constant judgement on friends and co workers to achieve the level of perfection i felt needed to be met daily is what burns me out of jobs and relationships i cant help but accuse others of being ignorant lazy selfish ect i hold others to a high standard that they could not or dont want to achieve i am getting better it took losing a very great job to help me realize this i now try to focus more on letting others just do what they want and just pick up what i feel is the slack
GetMotivated,removed,i am in the same place as yourself but i am trying to dig myself out of where my mind has burried me and im certainly feeling getting there slowly but surely i started by getting rid of unnecessary noise out of my life specifically news news dont help you in any shape or form its just negativity of matters that dont even relate to us turn them all off all of them unsub from all news type and political type discussions here dont get into arguments and dont think about them now i am trying to indulge myself into positive motivational podcasts there are plenty to choose from it doesnt really matter which one you choose just try and listen to them on a daily basis meditation is amazing dont understimate the power of motivation it was really hard on the first day but one week in and im already starting to really feel its effects i made a big list of things i need to do but i havent due to my immense power of procastination i look at the list every day and try and at least do one each day if i cant do it i dont blame myself but keep in mind that i need to do it tomorrow and for a introvert such as myself i made a deal with myself that i have to get out of the house at least once per day for whatever reason its not important what started going to the gym also because physical activity helps alot with keeping your mind sharp start somewhere anywhere and your journey begins good luck
GetMotivated,removed,so does everything else on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,or get robbed
GetMotivated,removed,i dont want to retype what i said just look at my other comments on this thread if you want an idea
GetMotivated,removed,shes black and runs not a very unrealistic goal
GetMotivated,removed,whiny little bitch
GetMotivated,removed,old enough giggity
GetMotivated,removed,just a heads up but high school kids know if theyll be in the olympics tbh i was being scouted by colleges specifically to then go into the olympics for rowing when i was in high school i didnt go down that route for a multitude of reasons but by high school you already know youre in the top like of athletes at your sport in the country

GetMotivated,removed,lets say you give units of willpower towards a goal if you gave of that you would give units of willpower towards that goal
GetMotivated,removed,the worst post ive ever seen here and there are no good posts here so congrats
GetMotivated,removed,thanks but i cant eat that much so ill probably end up throwing away at least kg of it do i have to pay for the extra even though its your mistake
GetMotivated,removed,this is fucking idiotic
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,i want the whatever that is the other one sounds like a lot of work
GetMotivated,removed,motivated me to unsubscribe thanks
GetMotivated,removed,usually i see a post or two from here and am like huh that is pretty motivational this however is the stupidest shit ive ever seen
GetMotivated,removed,this thread just proves that any statement or dubious metaphor can be twisted to mean whatever you want it to mean if youre willing to ignore common meanings and strict definitions to suit your needs this sub
GetMotivated,removed,excellent post its obviously about the compounded benefit of persistently moving forward as apposed to constantly regressing if you posted smugly posted you cant give or this is lame youre a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,youre welcome to your own interpretation but i am too is someone who improves their life each day literally orders of magnitude better than someone whose life degrades by an equal amount each day no im not a moron however it is equally foolish to think there is no merit in the supposition that progress is multiplicative at minimum its encouraging which this sub is supposed to be dedicated to
GetMotivated,removed,its a metaphor you autist its showing you what there is to gain and lose in life by giving more that you think you can or less you can keep your status quo and be the same a year later not try and get worse or become more than you ever thought you could be a year is a long time and you arent going to improve or regress every day out of the year but it shows what dedication and discipline can amount to over time
GetMotivated,removed,this is without a doubt the dumbest post ive ever seen i cannot stand this sub and i just dont get why its a default when you multiply any number a that is less than one by itself your result is going to be less than a was originally also if we had anything resembling exponentiation progress wed all be gods by now i understand what op was trying to say but this is intellectually dishonest if op wanted to make the point about compounding effort then youd want to have something like and because in a formula like this if youre trying to talk about growth of this nature your starting point is typically going to be
GetMotivated,removed,i did the same math a little differently
GetMotivated,removed,the comments in the sub are a graveyard
GetMotivated,removed,you should because its fucking stupid if you have everyday youd still get pretty fucking far in life its not like if you give two days in a two you multiply your effort each day if you really think about this the poster is arguing if you only give a day you might as well kill yourself because eventually youll be worth
GetMotivated,removed,no i meant what i said
GetMotivated,removed,fucking bill when will he start putting his two onehundredths in
GetMotivated,removed,now how can i intentionally interpret this message the wrong way then bitch about how stupid it is based on my own wrong understanding thats how this sub works apparently
GetMotivated,removed,what motivational about people who dont understand how math works
GetMotivated,removed,i originally read that as trolling hard instead of toiling hard then i realized my misreading was correct

GetMotivated,removed,does this work the opposite way as commanding people via mind control
GetMotivated,removed,whoosh
GetMotivated,removed,you must be fun at partiesor youre the guy that comments loudly when things in a movie dont make scientific sense i understand that in real life the above scenario ie being anywhere that close to lava is beyond physically impossible i get that but thats not the point of switching out diamonds for lava its more figurative than literal instead of a hefty reward the guy on the bottom walked away from a potentially fatal situation and the guy on top has no idea what hes digging towards
GetMotivated,removed,i recommend you look up willing suspension of disbelief or imagination i think theyd be really helpful concepts to you other than that bye its been fun talking to you
GetMotivated,removed,can someone tell me how to get my multiple sclerosis to fuck off so my body can do what my mind tells it to if anyone can give me an answer youll be a hero in my eyes

GetMotivated,removed,i see a lot of nice things on this sub but this is the first thing i found to genuinely motivate me
GetMotivated,removed,seriously this sub is so full of shit most of the time
GetMotivated,removed,theyre a complete fabrication like most of the stuff in this sub maybe this place was good before it became a default subreddit but ill be damned if it isnt full of trite bologna now
GetMotivated,removed,the downvotes were for the namecalling you absolute fool and you complete dingus and the complete disregard for the analogy op was trying to convey
GetMotivated,removed,not a motivation hipster i was never a member of this sub and im only commenting because i clicked this link before i logged in ive done this a handful of times before and everything ive seen on this sub is just the kind of crap they put on posters in school guidance counselor offices and hr departments maybe it was always this way and im just a cynical grump
GetMotivated,removed,i remember and i dont forget
GetMotivated,removed,how do you unsubscribe from a subreddit
GetMotivated,removed,keep in mind her main focus now and for a few years will be paying off her debt she is as happy as she has ever been
GetMotivated,removed,pullups in a skirt if you want to be taken seriously pull the sexism out of it i appreciate all youve done and what you do to help your mother otherwise
GetMotivated,removed,you know what motivates me when people dont get uptight and offended when people make jokes thats why im rnevermotivated
GetMotivated,removed,it never does unless you put in that little bit of extra effort i didnt realize that my quote was from anything honestly i never read the rgetmotivated posts because i think theyre silly
GetMotivated,removed,utrumpleps begs to differ

GetMotivated,removed,cool philosophy historic bro now fck off and see who is right you or the king whos followers you persecuted you better hope the logic of your justifications are right considering you fcked with the earliest of us when we did nothing as the other foundation of the west christians never started the bloodsport that hallmarked the thirst of hate and violence maybe our later thirst for hate and violence came from ancient roman influence
GetMotivated,removed,yeah because doing whatever the fuck you want and be then forgiven is justice

GetMotivated,removed,i actually wrote about this amazing book on my website such a great book heres the main part of it i have been reading a lot about being successful financially free and overall self improvement i would never be here if it wouldnt of been for a life changing book called the slight edge by jeff olson i highly recommend it and its the book that craved my hunger for books i never had i hated reading when i was younger and in school but it was because i was reading about things i could care less about being successful and happy is something i care a lot about jeff olson jeff olson reading is so crucial i cant believe i was so ignorant to think that i didnt need to read or thought that all reading was boring and unnecessary i had to find my area of interest so that i didnt see it as a chore but as an opportunity to dive into someones mind who is more wise intelligent and successful qualities i find very important i am so happy and fortunate i started to read again the large majority dont read another book after college instead of watching a movie tonight start reading a book if you havent read one in a while the moral of the slight edge is to do the little things every day day in and day out being consistent with the little things over time will turn into results that will have a snow ball effect just how i am writing this today i would never have started this if it wouldnt be because i am on a consistent search for learning on how i can improve learn and take action face my fears get out of my comfort zone again and again lose the fear of failure every time i get uncomfortable now i push a little harder because i know i am going to learn something learning is part of life and now i love learning and growing i turned this past week and this past year i have learned more about myself this past year than i have in the past decade i encourage everyone take a step towards greatness leave this world a little better when youre gone i dont know everything but i will continue to learn and share i love to share and to teach join me on this journey and maybe you will learn a thing or two as well along the way bare with me and my writing im still learning how to write well one way to learn is to continuously practice and practice some more i would appreciate any feedback on my writing and subjects i am open to anything 🙂 feel free to leave a comment and i welcome you httpjessimendozacomstartingthejourney

GetMotivated,removed,i hate this kind of dismissiveness and excuse making im not speaking for depressionbut anxiety is not a chemical imbalance you can help yourself with this one if you try over years ago i was in a living nightmare cuz of anxiety probably panic attacks a daya constant barrage of anxious thoughts that were so bad i dreaded going to sleep cuz it would mean id have to be alone with them there was one point i broke both legs in a bad accident snd wound up in the hospital the anxietyanxious thoughts were still worse than the pain i was in i couldnt believe it i wouldnt have wished that shit on my worst enemy like i said it was an absolute nightmare i was convinced i was losing my mind and the only thing that i held onto was that crazy people dont realize theyre crazy or some shit like that i thought i had heard once i tried going to a psychiatrist and taking zoloft it made me feel like i wasnt myself at all even moreso than i was already living with just a zombie stopped it almost immediately thats when i found this dudes website httpcharleslindencom reading through it i felt some sort of relief and i actually ended up tracking this guy down in london im in america and calling him up he was gracious as hell speaking to a year old kid calling him out of the blue he could relate to all of what i told him i was going through the day i called himi had tried going to the movies i couldnt sit through the whole thing my thoughts were too much and i had to leave i was devastated that it had gotten this bad when i spoke with him he told me he had a similar experience while watching the beach in theatres i ended up reading this guys book and his program and lo and behold it fucking worked after several monthsa year my anxiety and the thoughts lessened until they were goneor even better i could eventually think about things that would cause a panic attack and it would have no effect on me at all in a nutshell this is basis of the program anxiety is caused by the amygdala flight or fight part of the brain being revved up as fuck like an engine in a parked car and you beep pressing the pedal down so the entire goal is to chill that part of your brain out you do it by relaxing yourself and distracting yourself eventually you get out of the habit of being anxious you get out of this mode where youre revved up all the time my main point is if this is something youre seriously struggling with i would go check out that guys site and do his program asap i imagine i had this shit as bad as it can get and i took my life back from it and for you cynical redditors no one is paying me to write this i just know how fucking miserable anxiety can be and how much it can dominate your life and every time i see this brought up i try to tell my story just incase someone reads it and decides to do what i did good luck to all

GetMotivated,removed,direct democracydo you realize what that means let me explain it because only a fucking moron wants to live in an actual democracy it means that every citizen million people would present legislation and vote on other peoples legislation it would be complete chaos after the first hours of a true democracy the united states is not now and never has been a democracy for the reason i just statedit wouldnt work for such a large population and geographical area hence it was designed as a representative form of government a republic under a specific set of rules constitution a constitutional republic

GetMotivated,removed,reddits opinion on elon musk usually falls into catagories those who admire him as an extraordinary guy and a role model and those who feel that admiring him smacks of hero worship and circlejerking i believe elon musk is unlike other people in his ability to accept risk his willingness to sacrifice as well as his drive to realize his visions whether that makes me a proponent of great man theory or not doesnt matter he is a great man after paypal he could have become a cookiecutter startup investor and lived off of the interest instead he went on to build great companies employing thousands and changing industries how can you dismiss a guy like that

GetMotivated,removed,people drastically overestimate what they can achieve in a year and drastically underestimste what they can do in a decade i applaud those who burn brightly but those people are the reason why the term burnt out evolved slow and steady wins the race as life is a marathon instead of a sprint but you do you homie
GetMotivated,removed,

GetMotivated,removed,swallow those pills laqeueefa
GetMotivated,removed,

GetMotivated,removed,we are not supposed to please you this sub is like completely different place when i head into the comments what a mistake this sub is great as long as you dont go into comments which are all just neckbeards picking on every quote proving how wrong it is and perhaps feeling less insecure for a second
GetMotivated,removed,im quitting my job a statute with a beard told me to do it
GetMotivated,removed,paperhelporg is the only site i can trust because the quality is still reliable
GetMotivated,removed,well this sub is called get motivated i guess it doesnt necessarily mean get motivated to keep living
GetMotivated,removed,this is a really cute and ignorant quote helps if you detach from reality though
GetMotivated,removed,this sub man ive been subbed for awhile now and every post is just comments on why the post is stupid you cant win
GetMotivated,removed,normally i find this sub a little preachy and a little wishy washy but this is genuinely great advice
GetMotivated,removed,i hope you dont listen to these people not shocking medical advice from reddit is shit you likely have metabolic syndrome and youre likely insulin resistant its bad news but you shouldnt feel bad about yourself obesity is generally a symptom not a first cause two book recommendations im not affiliated with these in any way they just helped me the obesity code and fat chance once you understand the biochemistry all of this is curable
GetMotivated,removed,nice flipperoni hazy ninjerooski why do i feel racist all of a sudden
GetMotivated,removed,before it was not a priority but now it is im going to filter out this sub from rall
GetMotivated,removed,time is a flat circle

GetMotivated,removed,if you are not gaining weight but rather are at a continuous weight then yes literally all it takes to lose weight is to eat less or move more
GetMotivated,removed,aint nobody got that for that
GetMotivated,removed,upvotes in hours i wouldnt call that succeeding
GetMotivated,removed,dunno about middle names but streetlamp is known to be a pretty solid choice for a first name
GetMotivated,removed,seriously fuck the haters family and friends are the worst critics fuck them all and create something great
GetMotivated,removed,this is the worst subreddit on the entire site
GetMotivated,removed,something this sub doesnt say is most things are going to be failure and knowing when to quit is better than being positive and persevering when its obvious success will never come the wisdom to know the difference between futility and gritty perseverance is probably the most important thing
GetMotivated,removed,rshittygetmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,so racially hes pretty cool
GetMotivated,removed,so racially hes pretty cool
GetMotivated,removed,yunno just when i was about to unsub this one it shows me something i can relate to
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,knowing this sub all the comments will actually be positive this time
GetMotivated,removed,the hive mind it cares not which subreddit as long as there is karma to be had also this is a failure of the mods on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,sounds like you should give the great dismal swamp a try a few writers have succeeded and a couple have attempted and failed to commit suicide there there is a deal for a hour swamp ride going on right now
GetMotivated,removed,share it and suck it the most successful people are the people who know how to take criticism from the people that matter without breaking in two dont worry i say that knowing i struggle with this too
GetMotivated,removed,only crybabies who have had luxury of being raised in somewhat normal circumstances you know motherfathersiblings first years foodclothingshelter at least basic schooling friends etc dont get this supposed watermark you really dont know how it is when youve litterally got no one no one
GetMotivated,removed,ending up as a totally wasted piece of shit smoking pot with random people im gonna chat up on new years eve is not a priority xd

GetMotivated,removed,a friend of mine suggested that i start listening to podcasts and i did reluctantly he predicted that i would stop listening to music but miss cleo has nothing on him i have added podcasts to my entertainment and educational content mix you can tell a lot about a person by the books that they read and the same can be said about the podcasts they enjoy here are my favourite podcasts please check out my blog post podcasts that you should subscribe to in
GetMotivated,removed,in what kind of shithole of a country you live that you end up being homeless if you quit your job
GetMotivated,removed,then youre dumb why would you need to be motivated to take a financial gamble why do you guys even come to this sub do you just not understand what its for
GetMotivated,removed,you tell me it seems a lot of people dont understand that the advice in this sub is for people who have actual personal goals if you dont care about what happens to you then you quit or stay with anything whenever you want and it wont matter everyone thinks this stuff is life advice its not if you want to go be a buddhist monk or something then this stuff probably doesnt apply to you
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is just feel good catch phrases not real world practical advice lol its your fault your life sucks be a wolf stupid shit like that
GetMotivated,removed,meet me at a bar and ill tell you to get over your problems and provide someone to drink with ill get the first game of pool or darts and tell you that ill sing take on me at karaoke if you promise to sing something too but im going to sing the song whether you promise to sing or not about an your or two into the night ill talk to random people and work in the fact that you rescued a kitten from a sewer earlier and deserve to have a mouth on your genitalsive assumed your gender but im not going stay gender neutral until you confirm fair warning in a month i might ask to sleep on your couch and not leave for a month straight i wont offer any money but ill make dinner do dishes and generally keep things clean youll get into a new relationshipafter i leave you alone at a bar to meet some girl whos first name ends in an i youll talk to some wholesome person and hit it off and that person will slowly take over the cooking and cleaning and youll tell me that since im no longer contributing i have one week to find a new place nto live ill remind you of tenants rightssince im a landlord but leave that night and come back days later to pick up my stuff youll get married and have a kid with the wholesome person from the bar on christmas youll invite me over because we had some good times and you feel bad for me because my family lives across the country and i refuse to travel in december well get drunk like old times and youll ask me to be your childs godfather unfortunately your spouse will dislike the way you act around me and find me a total douchebag so you wont invite me over again ill hear about you from the barber shop that we now share but well only run into eachother every months at best by now youve deleted your facebook for some reason and never bothered to give me your new number one day ill swing by your place to surprise you out of the blue and somebody will answer the door saying they moved in months ago ill realize our years of friendship ended the night you met your spouse youll be over your problems but ill miss the fuck out of you
GetMotivated,removed,lol dumb
GetMotivated,removed,eat my butthole
GetMotivated,removed,and that was reason enough to share something that flies directly in the face of everything this sub is meant to accomplish
GetMotivated,removed,if you give as much effort as the artist your isnt going to change
GetMotivated,removed,yeah he should have thrown in the caveat unless if youre being stupid dont be a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,this sub needs to learn economics and something called reality
GetMotivated,removed,but what if i want to do this
GetMotivated,removed,ok it was your idea excuse me for being positive and creative despite your negativity my criticism of this lame adage is based on reality not everything that glitters is gold i know this thread likes to jerk themselves off to anything that rings of positivity but sometimes words that sounds prolificare just dumb but the selfhelp crowd that frequents this sub eats them up like a cult member embraces cult nonsense because they want to feel good
GetMotivated,removed,am i the only one that sees the cock and balls in the clouds
GetMotivated,removed,youre an idiot
GetMotivated,removed,this sub confirmed unwavy
GetMotivated,removed,pathetic
GetMotivated,removed,most ignorant and wildly incorrect thing ive ever heard
GetMotivated,removed,i didnt kick him out i gave him plenty of time to find a new place to live he chose to ignore everything and continue drinking he was affecting my relationship with my fiance and mother i didnt want to do it but its the only thing i could do to get my life back he completely burned every bridge he had with a nice fuck you in everyones face he took money from my retired mother with no problem lying to her as to why he needed it lied to everyone about drinking when he was visibly drunk there were so many people that wanted to help him but he didnt want help because to him he didnt have a problem
GetMotivated,removed,yes because people are ignorant and would rather sign online petitions and share news articles than get off their ass and actually do something about it
GetMotivated,removed,honestly this seems a bit pretentious and selfimportant
GetMotivated,removed,i got into an argument with a nice fuck you in everyones face
GetMotivated,removed,kinda just excusing yourself from acting like an idiot i think a lot of times people do overthink all the little things that no one really noticed but if you were being a jackass all night people are going to remember it if you find yourself waking up every weekend feeling that way maybe you should put the bottle down a little earlier
GetMotivated,removed,this only motivates me to procrastinate more i can just wait until i hit rock bottom
GetMotivated,removed,this is for all the lgbt people who have experienced hate crimes violence against them for there sexuality and those who lost family and friends after coming out all we have is eachother support your lgbt brothers and sisters if you cant donate then please share gofundmecomlgbtrightsfundraiser
GetMotivated,removed,so glad that a man of my color is finally in office change is for the better folks why cant the left understand
GetMotivated,removed,this man is a weird balance of oblivious and aware of just how much of an ass he really is
GetMotivated,removed,it only matters to people who wishes the uneducated stay ignorant so they appear even better by comparison
GetMotivated,removed,i constantly judge people so you can live in your fantasy world where people dont do that

GetMotivated,removed,i was thinking the same thing i hope he no english major
GetMotivated,removed,yesterday was a mystery tomorrow is history today is a gift thats why the called the present
GetMotivated,removed,not much in this sub is if you think logically its very hard to be motivated to do anything our lives are meaningless were all going to die in a minuscule amount of time no one will remember us or thing we did in years eventually the sun will die and our earth will too the universe will end in complete entropy and finally heat death but ehgo to the gym and lift stuff up guyz
GetMotivated,removed,congrats for reaching rallhot with your post nbsp i am a bot probably quite annoying i mean no harm though
GetMotivated,removed,being aware without improving is even worse than being ignorant of your past it will take its toll on you
GetMotivated,removed,this sub would upvote a picture of a turd if it said u can do it at the top
GetMotivated,removed,you must have an odd sense of humour if you laughed at that whats funny about that statement its firstly wrong and secondly doesnt even point anything out
GetMotivated,removed,i didnt hear about this

GetMotivated,removed,yea i didnt catch that at all from you someone is trolling or sjw
GetMotivated,removed,he is not an important or smart enough person yet to be quoted like that ignore quotes from famous people common douche bag
GetMotivated,removed,when you look back on life you wont have any regrets i guess ultimately we all end up dead at some point and its all meaningless as long as you can die peacefully then youve succeeded

GetMotivated,removed,youve only proved two things you are extremely ignorant and contradict yourself and it took you years to figure out what you need to do in life done at this point not going to sit here and listen to something year probably in his talking about literally nothing but i know something you dont
GetMotivated,removed,not really hank only reason your dad fought in the war is because the japanese bombed pearl harbor if fdr had his way the us would have been neutral even today many americans at the time agree with the nazis racist views and not that stressed at all
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think you know hwhat racism is
GetMotivated,removed,shut the fuck up
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,the fact that i can look at caricatures of my culture and laugh shows how comfortable i an as an american and its why i love this show againyou are taking this way too personally itsnot even about the charicatures the characters arteintentionally depictedas selfish foolish and backwards thats where the comedy comes from connie is the only straight man on that show not anybody even in the core family i am totally comfortable laughing at koth what are you talking about its a comedy first and foremost and what the fuck do you have lead poisoning or something this is the most idiotic drivel i have read in a while i want to be able to laugh at something what are you talkingabout i was talking about how the characters are written not your personal emotions and how you feel when you watch the show that still doesnt mean that the writers cant put in a few nuggets of truth in the script along with the jokes its like talking to a brickwall at this point have fun with your crippling victim complex
GetMotivated,removed,lots of butthurt nonamericans parading their inferiority complexes in this submission regurgitating historical revisionism as an instinctive response to something positive being said about the us its silly that people act like the us joined wwii at the last minute not realizing that it was the us joining that caused the war to end when it did and how it did the allies were losing across the board before the us entered the war look at a map of axisheld territory up until the very moment the us joined youll notice the axis territory was expanding until the us entered with troops and then began to recede and collapse immediately afterward the allies would have lost if the us didnt do anything only liars or idiots will deny that also the us was the only country to fight significantly in every theater of war the us did the most in n africa the med italy and then western europe post dday while simultaneously fighting japan on the other side of the world will very little help the us did a whole hell of a lot more to help the allies against germany than the help the us received against japan and the us did this while supplying not only its own military but all of the allies with literally the majority of their war material lets quote stalin himself who is just about the last person who would benefit from admitting the importance of the us people always say the soviets won wwii but the they only began to make offensive progress after usprovided war aid began flooding in and after the us opened the second front in europe something canadians and brits failed to do on their own without the us in the disaster later euphemistically called the dieppe raid a liberation of western europe would not have occurred without the us and the us constituted the bulk of forces look at simpson army usa dempsey army usa hodges army usa patton army usa patch army usa bradley army usa montgomery army uk crerar army canada and again the us did this while fighting another regional war on the other side of the planet no other country fought a truly world war in the manner that the us did
GetMotivated,removed,usa stressing about the nazis taking over europe every country in the world was trading openly with germany pick one
GetMotivated,removed,i like how the one dude at about minutes looks genuinely bored and is wearing his headphones on his cheekbones what a cock
GetMotivated,removed,i agree with unwmarlow and im not even going to disagree with you i cant do shit about world problems nor do i care call me anything you want this place is burning up
GetMotivated,removed,have a shitty day troll
GetMotivated,removed,oh yeah i still do minute things like take a garbage bag out and pick up trash i see on the street its just that i cant make a whole crowd of people do the same so i just generally stopped caring about spreading the word
GetMotivated,removed,your ignorance is truly astounding i cannot see why you selectively choose scientific evidence i mean you kind of can right youve already been granted insight into their closedmindednesspisspoor troll attempt
GetMotivated,removed,please eat plants consuming animals is the most environmentally destructive thing humans do you would have a much greater impact and still use all the paper plates you want if you trade your destructive carnivorous diet for a plantbased one want to talk about water every quarterpounder you buy is a waste of at least gallons you cant eat that and then turn around to tell me i brush my teeth wrong its literally a drop in the gigantic bucket please stop eating my planet
GetMotivated,removed,nope thats why i dont care ive done my fair share and ive gained nothing from it
GetMotivated,removed,if consumption is x in the equation of life then population is the integer in front of it which multiplies you would have to lower consumption to zero for population not to have an effect on waste theres a healthy equilibrium between consumption and population its obvious to me that population will become a concern to all countries in the not too distant future china already had a reproduction ban india isnt far behind them in population
GetMotivated,removed,there seems to be httpswwwscientificamericancomarticleusbanscommonchemicalsinantibacterialsoaps possibly to avoid it
GetMotivated,removed,wanna know what correlates extremely well with less war globally agricultural abundance btw plants actually love warmer temperatures and high levels freaking the fuck out is not really justified at this point we still have plenty of time to fix it unless you live in florida but if thats the case fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,as someone who lives under an area where the ozone layer is severely depleted your so called alarmist trope actually makes a difference as the sun burns skin far worse and people get skin cancers even smaller moles a lot more its not some sort of joke but a real issue that affects real people through cases of skin cancer it is better now but thats only because the world took some action by banning cfls
GetMotivated,removed,not gonna read no one has ever silenced the world this sub is pretty terrible for quality
GetMotivated,removed,america will implode before the pompous greedy backwards senile bastards in charge give two shits about future generations wasnt it the american people who voted a climate change denier into the presidency
GetMotivated,removed,and calling someone a hypocrite is the definition of ad hominem if a crack addict tells school kids they shouldnt smoke crack that is a good message to spread and a good deed regardless of what the fuck he does in his spare time
GetMotivated,removed,seriously kill yourself do everyone a favor

GetMotivated,removed,hey fellow redditor are you so deep in shit that you envy this guys problems then head on down to and start rebuilding yourself today still deep in shit been called worthless by your parents andor grandpa so long that you dont know how to not beat the crap out of yourself we got a twoforone special on rwholesomememesa please and a thank you now gets you two memes instead of one positive memes may result in basking for long periods of time in warm fuzziness or the cuteness of doggos as well as increased compassion towards self and others positive meme doses work best when followed by a nonzero day minimum and when accompanied by healthy assertiveness take only as many as you need to make your day as good as it can be dosage may vary depending on day
GetMotivated,removed,unless its a race dumb fucks
GetMotivated,removed,keep thinking youre not an absolute moron if it helps your sleep at night i had people call me doctor by and no not the phd kind dumb fuck

GetMotivated,removed,shes an actress that was in a trilogy of films then waited years for the same franchise to make more films whats so inspiring about her shes dead that sucks but just because someone dies doesnt make them anymore wise or inspiring than they were before they died

GetMotivated,removed,sometimes you have to take risks being a smartass and saying stuff like that doesnt help anyone sorry my friends do this same shit all the time and complain they have everything in front of them they just dont see it ive profited off a few of their ideas because they kept bitching instead of spending nights or weekends working on them idiots
GetMotivated,removed,ssshhh no no no travel is only for the rich dont you know its impossible for everyone else so just let them sit and waste their money while bitching about how they cant do anything cause they never got lucky in life

GetMotivated,removed,only occurs when my hafiz muhammad ali and we can talk about my balls being quiet
GetMotivated,removed,they motivate me to touch myself which isnt particularly useful at getting anything else done

GetMotivated,removed,riamverysmart
GetMotivated,removed,pretty sure this is just a story he tells to little kids and careful engineers to punk them into thinking hes a pompous dick
GetMotivated,removed,this is nearly riamverysmart style cringe
GetMotivated,removed,you accused me of trolling earlier look in the mirror i proved with facts that your hero is a dangerous fraud who has recklessly ended the lives of people with his radical beliefs why dont you try find the data that supports your fiction yourself ive already debunked your fictional account of dr ben carson youre trolling nothing more
GetMotivated,removed,its really crazy if you think about it one minute you are here and the next one no more we wake all stressed out for what
GetMotivated,removed,this comment must be a joke that or youre an enormously ignorant stupid person
GetMotivated,removed,intelligent conversation doesnt happen in characters sorry to inconvenience you to read for an extra seconds musk has a degree in physics he has no training in engineering at all engineering is not simply numbers it is highly applied science beyond what a physicist chemist or biologist would study or understand there are mathematicians and computer scientists working for him too and he can work on some of the code but if you think hes doing a majority of the work then youre simply an ignorant fool of epic proportions and you prove my point your ego is too dense for any intelligent thought to marinate in conversation look at your reply youre a total asshole how does anyone say yes id like to convince this jerk instead of fuck this guy im just going to ignore him
GetMotivated,removed,this belongs in rimverysmart

GetMotivated,removed,bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,the only embarrassing thing about this pic is the justified type
GetMotivated,removed,are we intelligent enough here to rationally discriminate between some and common because ive already clarified that please dont tell me youre playing some childish pedantic game in a desperate attempt to make me wrong because youre emotionally butthurt about something i said that happens to be unpleasant but true thats not how to deal with real issues in adult society op made it sound common specifically he likened it to asking someone out thats ridiculous never mind that some people have an issue with many situations like that we all know that hes making it sound common if it is then thats really a problem
GetMotivated,removed,so go ask that girl on headphones with a fatass booty on the eliptical for her number
GetMotivated,removed,like that time i shat so hard that i torn an ass muscle sure it was in front of the womens auxiliary sure my girlfriends mom was holding my hand sure i had to limp across the packed fairgrounds with no pants but i found that gold filling i swallowed
GetMotivated,removed,hi my name is roomnoxii and this is jackass
GetMotivated,removed,i think we had two very different lives growing up and view two very different versions of the internet now
GetMotivated,removed,yes we should all start our own businesses regardless of assets or education everyone should be a business owner with many employees and nobody should be an employee for anyone this is a sound plan and im not being completely sarcastic at this naive view of how poor hardworking people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps like luck and environment dont play an enormous role in success
GetMotivated,removed,does this sub really actually motivate anyone has anyone ever read one of these idiotic fucking pictures and thought ill stop being a piece of shit like i do everyday and do something important why is this stupid fucking sub defaulted i couldnt tell the difference between this sub and if you put rshittyadvice on stupid fucking pictures
GetMotivated,removed,my reaction too how does such trash get upvoted
GetMotivated,removed,you are naive in the extreme try just try to grow eventually when everything everything is only expandable in quanta what really happens is your dayjob performance suffers you lose your reputation in your current companyindustry you find yourself in limbo where jumping is necessary to keep growing but impossible due to lack of capital and knowledge
GetMotivated,removed,now go say the same in this thread in the same fp
GetMotivated,removed,great idea most if not all small businesses are wildly successful im quitting my job today idiot
GetMotivated,removed,lol
GetMotivated,removed,i saw the bo burnham interview on conan too
GetMotivated,removed,warning warning warning trigger alert that picture and those rules are racist bigoted name your ism to the farleft snowflakes on college campuses fairness for everyone is the underlying principle to one of our two political parties consequences be damned
GetMotivated,removed,i dont know i feel this one is kind of bs life is unfair this only applies to certain people how can you say life is fair for someone whos just walking home from school with their brother and they are caught in the middle of a fire fight how can you say life is fair when people who did nothing are born into royalty like in india while theres literally a megaslum of poverty struck people who were born into it and their parents born into it living a life of recycling used garbage of those luxurious people its more fair to say people have a sense of entitlement and need to get that kind of mentality out of their head if your ambitions are based on short term rewards like a dog receives treats for doing tricks then you arent going to get very far in accomplishing your longterm goals
GetMotivated,removed,this offends me i down voted this why wont the mods delete it its not fair s
GetMotivated,removed,i was surprised to see this article in this sub reality isnt motivational at all in fact seeking motivation is synonymous to escaping reality
GetMotivated,removed,this motivated me to be depressed
GetMotivated,removed,this is just a shittier version of that cracked article from a few years back
GetMotivated,removed,did you happen to read the article or just the headline its a painful thing to believe of course which is why were constantly assuring each other the opposite just do your best we hear youre only in competition with yourself the funny thing about platitudes like that is theyre designed to make you try harder anyway if competition really didnt matter wed tell struggling children to just give up
GetMotivated,removed,read actually philosophy this shit made me vomit
GetMotivated,removed,im not sure why but i have the feeling this is a profoundly stupid oversimplification and based upon a lot of preconceived assumptions
GetMotivated,removed,get fucked your suffering is pleasurable and its because you make it that way i would pay to watch you suffer it would be hilarious thats fair
GetMotivated,removed,there is truth to the phrase life is not fair its not there is illness accidents mistakes all sorts of ways life itself can really fuck you things like that are no more unfair than flipping a coin and losing everybody flips that coin by virtue of being born some will land on no cancer while others land on cancer would you throw your cards down at a poker tournament and complain to the officials that the tournament is not fair because you keep getting dealt a junk hand
GetMotivated,removed,i mean its impossible to deny that those people exist but its basically a waste of time to worry about them one of the really unfortunate things about the human experience is that our worldview is based on personal experience which is really an incredibly small sample size to work off of so yeah it sounds like youve been exposed to some assholery the important thing to focus on is that these people are really a tiny minority of the population they just have a massively disproportionate amount of ability to affect how we view life because theyre so toxic thats really the danger of assholes worst thing they can do to you is convince you the whole world is like that unless youre directly in their power and then you need to get out whatever shit theyre doing to you is likely temporary but the feeling that the world is just out to fuck you can be lifelong
GetMotivated,removed,this was easily the most demotivational thing ive seen on this sub thank you for inspiring me never to try anything ever again
GetMotivated,removed,quick summary of the article moral ideals are dumb because real life isnt morally perfect i wonder if the author of this article also things that there is nothing wrong with racism and that our broken idea of equality is the real problem
GetMotivated,removed,how did this make it to the front
GetMotivated,removed,nothing like telling people to emulate some impossible standard theyll never achieve this post has motivated me to finally block this sub
GetMotivated,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
GetMotivated,removed,so does a serial killer count
GetMotivated,removed,hah over one year of life try you amateur then well talk life sucks and is not worth living you can try to reprogram yourself but youll be back we always come back
GetMotivated,removed,reading this is the cause of my major depression cocks gun

GetMotivated,removed,right one yearthats like an introductory course in being sad try being bipolar and having everyone tell you to just put on a smile and think happy thoughts and youll get over it ignorant asses

GetMotivated,removed,rats i wanted to like nelson mandela
GetMotivated,removed,who decides what the greater good is for some isis is fighting for the greater good
GetMotivated,removed,go back to apologizing for isis murderers its slightly more believable
GetMotivated,removed,lol quality trolling there guy
GetMotivated,removed,youre right mandelas terrorist past didnt invalidate his views its the fact that he ran south africa into the ground when he came to power that proves his views were invalid black africans who live in south africa are by majority saying they things were better under apartheid when polled like you have to fuck up pretty bad for people to want that again
GetMotivated,removed,they certainly never lived considering you just made that up
GetMotivated,removed,calling bullshit while he did create the mk armed wing of the anc under his lead they mainly concentrated on sabotage other rival groups like the pac were much more proliferate in indiscriminate killing there were many instances as anc president while leading nationwide strikes he would advocate against armed resistance against the police even when this resulted in the slaughter of protesters the national party of south africa at that time were the real culprits they enacted apartheid which resulted in policies like restricting the ability for blacks indians and coloureds from obtaining real estate even kicking people out of homes marrying other races completely dominating and controlling education banning people etc if you classify someone who blew up a powerline or railroad track resulting in no loss of human life a terrorist then what do you call the np government who killed protestors in the thousands
GetMotivated,removed,newton didnt murder people

GetMotivated,removed,i really like his rant on live at the comedy store where he compares america to a woman

GetMotivated,removed,hookers expect you right now
GetMotivated,removed,well memed
GetMotivated,removed,rtitlegore
GetMotivated,removed,how is that motivational again
GetMotivated,removed,what purpose does the anger serve when expressed theres a difference between telling somebody you are angry and actually expressing anger if you are dealing with an irrational shithead expressing your anger isnt going to calm them down or make them see things your way if you are dealing with a rational person they will be willing to listen to you even if you dont emphasize your point of view with angry words in neither case does it make sense to express anger and its funny that you say we must not live in the real world because its only by living in the real world for quite a long time that i have finally come to realize these things
GetMotivated,removed,well we are on reddit
GetMotivated,removed,yeah i agree i dont really see how this is supposed to be motivating anyways i guess if your goal is peace maybe thats motivating personally having a fiery comeback and hearing everyone go ooooooh is incredibly satisfying to me
GetMotivated,removed,no it isnt fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,thats how you infuriate an angry person even more seeing someone remain calm yet poking you with a passive aggressive stick at the same time is a sure fire way to get me really pissed off something quick even if you arent being passive aggressive remaining calm can seem like holier than thou attitude once again having the potential to be quite infuriating the best way to deal with aggression is with aggression but tempered with empathy
GetMotivated,removed,i just spent a lot of time on the internet trolling and getting trolled personal attacks used to really get to me but now i can just shrug them off

GetMotivated,removed,yeah you absolutely can be too intelligent for your own good also teen as formative years can be pretty tough you are being bombarded with all these new thoughts and are starting to notice all the little white lies parents other adults fed you with to keep you in line i also dunno whether youll read this or not since you made throwaway account but tldr is dont be too hard on yourself life by definition is whatever you make of it can you think of it as a routine yes is life in itself pointless absolutely but that shouldnt make you depressed you should rather be proud of yourself that you are no longer a kid that needs externally induced higher purpose to go through life but are free to start choosing your purpose ive talked last week about same problem from slightly different angle here is the link if you want to go deeper into the topic
GetMotivated,removed,he needs to go back to middle school

GetMotivated,removed,oh come on man is his ass soft like a baby what does it taste like
GetMotivated,removed,i think thats foolish you listened to mark manson right his article on the secret is a good article are you gonna write it off because hes also peddled crap of course not shit watch this is the kind of candid advice that is extremely hard to find what he says is true and its good advice are you gonna write it off because its martin shkreli who said it clearly you shouldnt take advice from someone sketchy if there is a risk it will leave you with permanent illeffects riskreward still applies if youre getting surgery you should be cautious as hell i am also disabled though probably less severely i have significantly improved my situation by taking lowrisk advice from people who are otherwise unreliable you have to differentiate
GetMotivated,removed,so i became a pompous sarcastic dickhead
GetMotivated,removed,its smart people syndrome
GetMotivated,removed,the vast majority of depression is bull shit i dont know why youre getting so butt hurt about it
GetMotivated,removed,relevant post from months ago
GetMotivated,removed,ngt is a douchebag
GetMotivated,removed,my life is just so monotonous my girl best friend just left me because of well reasons fuck you bitch oh and coming to me 😂 im a pathetic loser im a teenager im so fat and yeah ive started losing weight but lol who cares when nobody else around you gives enough of a crap my counselor is aiming me for ivy league im aiming myself for death i dont speak with a lot of people anymore i dont know why or how people keep leaving me people keep backstabbing me ive always done the right thing in my life but now ive got nothing left no one gives a shit if i did something good or bad people only care about me if they have some personal benefit from it i have nightmares so i dont like to sleep all i do is study or go to the gym ive come to this point thinking that if i work hard today maybe just maybe tomorrow wont be as bad but each day is worse everyday is a war and i always lose no matter what decisions i make i am a loser a few days ago my best friend was chilling me down all i could do was laugh i laughed like a deranged maniac in my life im such a loser that people leave me hahahahahaha i dont need motivation i just want money so i can run away and just chill
GetMotivated,removed,it sounds like your only experience with depression is emo teenagers and your father grumbling about kids today needing to stop whining and pull themselves up by their bootstraps honestly at this point youre either being wilfully stupid or youre being a troll listen to what people are telling you you can kick and scream all you like but ive given you hard proof that it doesnt steam from bullshit depression is often hereditary theyre born with an imbalance in the brain mcdonalds doesnt cause deviations in brain chemicals like that are you thick you sound like a teenager whos going through their im smarter than everyone else phase especially when you insist that those suffering from depression dont engage their minds some of the greatest minds in history suffered from depression leo tolstoy and charles dickens prolific writers had depression sylvia plath suffered from depression alexander mcqueen one of the greatest fashion designers of our time depression kurt cobain depression robin williams depression john nash nobel prize winner depression tell me again how depression is caused by people not engaging their minds enough you little smart arse you are not more informed on the subject than me nor are you cleverer than the doctors who dedicate their lives to studying this your ideas are meaningless you dont have a degree you dont suffer from depression you dont actually know anything so listen to what people are telling you and actually learn something jesus christ if you wont let hard scientific evidence inform your views of how the world works youre going to have a very hard very confusing life
GetMotivated,removed,a shame you became an obnoxious asshole then neil
GetMotivated,removed,cliche circlejerk
GetMotivated,removed,well too bad he kind of grew up to be a dick hes entitled to his lack of belief in god but he makes no friends with people because of the dickish remarks he makes about people of faith many people tend to believe in the way that sagan himself appears to there is no proof of god but no proof against either i believe that the flaws of man are apparent in religion but there is too much we dont understand to rule out a higher power of some sort whether that is a deity and creation in some fashion the old nothing existed then it blew up argument or the computer simulation argument something is out there tyson being a dick about it doesnt even help his own arguments
GetMotivated,removed,being a cocky bastard doesnt take away from someones competency wanting someone to be wrong because you got your ego bruised only goes to show your own insecurities most extremists have a ton of flaws too but at the same time theyre still brilliant people that you can learn from instead of getting butthurt
GetMotivated,removed,youre so full of shit youre just regurgitating what somebody else said no wonder you try to fish for comments like these youre not smart enough to get upvoted on a single post it looks like
GetMotivated,removed,jared leto is not someone who motivates what a fucking shit head
GetMotivated,removed,conservatives always accuse him of lying or teaching a false narrative because he talks about the truth of the matter that conservative ideology and christianity have been trying to destroy since even before science as we know it existed plus global warming he talks about racism in the science community etc just typical shit heads
GetMotivated,removed,this neil guy isnt a scientist though hes a reality show star whose understanding of science is incredibly shallow and political hes the twitter scientist i hate to be so negative but all this talk about who neil is misses the point of science the nerds in the labs who arent running for every camera and spending all their time on social media discovering things questioning things and not simply making politically popular statements for yet more fame deserve our praise not the guy who sucks up all the oxygen
GetMotivated,removed,httpswwwredditcomriamverysmartsearchqneiltysonsorttoprestrictsrontall
GetMotivated,removed,i get this is inspiring and all that but isnt neil tyson infamous for being a huge dick at events
GetMotivated,removed,the ones at the top arent even that bad – i mean yeah okay fuck borders youd almost get the impression he has some well thought out anarchist views or something but nope its mostly repeatedly hes also had some extremely condescending clueless political ramblings
GetMotivated,removed,mmmm no youre a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,what lol it makes no sense why i would google that i dont care what he has done in the past it has nothing to do with what were originally talking about im not saying he isnt arrogant im not even saying he cant be wrong i understand he is a human being and makes mistakes but for what we were originally talking about this is completely irrelevant youre just grasping at straws at this point i thought at first you were a rational person but i see now youre a thirsty fellow looking to put others down in a typical passive aggressive millenial way
GetMotivated,removed,youre a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,wait reddit i thought were supposed to hate black science man because hes pompous and a knowitall now we like him again

GetMotivated,removed,wwwredditcomutheegoraptor
GetMotivated,removed,him being a knowitall killjoy is the bulk of what came up when he tweeted about gravity and other similar movies its disingenuous to claim that no one cared when theres evidence online that everyone cared far too much for weeks afterward to me hes always had the tone of a famous lecturer who unfortunately has access to twitter if thats pompous to some i get it but im honestly hoping for a link to a video or quote where he comes off as an overtly pedantic dick
GetMotivated,removed,im gonna call you in the next time some dumbfuck uses the mother jones data on mass shootings in america or any of their gun control shit mother jones is one of the most popular sources for antigun redditors

GetMotivated,removed,free and easy money
GetMotivated,removed,kill myself
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you op you remind me of my parents i will get that dog its just that now isnt a good time and in a few months i will be very busy
GetMotivated,removed,the step right after that is the realization you can do and be whatever the fuck you want because nobody cares
GetMotivated,removed,really this is just sappy sentimental bullshit theres nothing remotely motivating about any of this some guy apparently sent this completely at random he has no idea who its actually addressed to he could be sending it to a child rapist for all he knows actually whats more likely is that the op made the whole thing up he sent this postcard to himself took a photo of it and uploaded it knowing that the sheep on reddit would lap this shit up and allow him to farm karma in any case its earned a downvote from me
GetMotivated,removed,critical thinking is a useful skill to have provided you use it wisely considering this is a sub for motivation i dont see how your critical analysis albeit true from a logical standpoint was useful for motivation you said that it seemed poetic is it not yet analyzed its literal meaning instead of i dont see how it is logical to parse a message in a different language than was it was written
GetMotivated,removed,plot twist op is the neighborhood pedo
GetMotivated,removed,you dont believe that everyone is equally worthy of unconditional love if you do believe it then the message is genuine and very personal i think the writer probably believes it doesnt make them naive or pretentious just a little like mr rogers
GetMotivated,removed,you sent this to yourself because nobody loves you
GetMotivated,removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicspng title titletext brains aside i wonder how many poorlywritten xkcdcomparsing scripts will break on this title or stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics

GetMotivated,removed,okay
GetMotivated,removed,gay everything on this sub is gay
GetMotivated,removed,you cant think of anything substantial to say
GetMotivated,removed,ha that surely doesnt sound like carlin i had a van experience with carlin a few years before he died he had a show in denver and started off ok but then he went on a ten minute diatribe about feminism that wasnt even remotely funny some people started groaning and he said what a lousy crowd must be some aspen pricks that stumbled in he babbled on and got a few forced chuckles but it was really bad it seemed he had lost his humorous edge and just wanted to bitch i think he died a miserable lonely life but a lot of artists have also i guess
GetMotivated,removed,what do you want to achieve in i started my changes in december and i plan to continue with these habits so i can reach my goals for this year this year i would like to get fit i have been hitting the gym almost times a week for the past couple months and i will continue to do so the goal is timeswk meal prepping and drinking more water are also focuses of mine to achieve this goal code outside of work i would like to become a better developer in order to do so i plan to code outside of work on a regular basis by working on my own projects read everyday it could be a couple of pages or a few chapters but the goal is to read everyday i definitely enjoy spending time at the library during lunch or just grabbing the kindle and reading before bedtime pay off debt stick to my monthly budget do something new everyday activities the goal is to get out of my comfort zone face my fears andor do things i wouldnt normally do on a daily basis a few things ive done so far are gone zip lining held a python and worn a onesie out in public these activities that i have done so far have helped me keep my thoughts positive
GetMotivated,removed,it also touched me pretty hard i remember sitting there watching the last episode and it felt like a fire sparked somehwere i had been numb for a long time it felt like epiphany sadly bojack is one of the few shows i can deeply relate to i started jogging right after i remmebered there was nothing more to wathc so i went out for a jog in the middle of the night which i had neglected the last couple of months i realise jogging was meant to be symbolic but it meant something to me at that moment its a shame i can never hold on to these feelings for longer than a couple hoursdaysweeks ve had plenty over the years i guess thats what this sub is for
GetMotivated,removed,its depressing as fuck but also hilarious and hopeful i recommend this show to everyone on this sub or just anyone whos looking for a great show
GetMotivated,removed,the only thing carlin said that was remotely similar was fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity this shit is misquoted and fuck you for posting it moron

GetMotivated,removed,i was exactly like you growing up i was quiet had no hobbies no real friends struggled to have a simple conversation never put an ounce of effort into school my junior year in high school i was sitting at a lunch table with some people i barley knew and hated just because i didnt have anyone to sit with one day as i was walking to the cafeteria dreading another thirty minutes with these people i had nothing in common with i realized i didnt have to struggle to fit in i said screw it and went into the library to read at a table alone i kept going back to the library day after day sitting by myself just catching up on homework or reading or just sitting and relaxing i started to really enjoy that time alone rather than having awkward uncomfortable conversations with people i didnt even like i started doing better in school because i spent that time working on class work which i actually started to enjoy i read a book about running there and i decided that might be fun and i got really into running i stopped caring so much about what people thought of me then one day i noticed you other kid who sat at a table alone every day at lunch he did the same thing i did avoided everyone and spent the entire lunch hour hanging out in there to avoid the other people then one day he came and sat down next to me and introduced himself he said he didnt have any friends either and that he saw me there every day and finally built up the courage to come say hi i started sitting with him every day at lunch and we eventually started venturing outside talking reading not talking we just sort of clicked me and that boy have been married for years now and have helped each other become more outgoing and over time we developed new interests and hobbies i dont consider myself shy anymore i have no problem talking to people or making friends the point is that you need to fcous on you just try one thing different try everything you will find something you love and the friends will follow sometimes you just need to change one part of your life and it will have a snowball effect and create a whole new world

GetMotivated,removed,the threads in this sub is always such a shit show
GetMotivated,removed,youre right the guy above you can fuck off dopamine is probably the most misunderstood neurotransmitter there is people spread these stupid ideas about its function based on a sophomoric understanding of how the human brain works
GetMotivated,removed,not that you are wrong but to further sonnequiturs argument change the way you look at things and the things you look at change here is my proof i posted on this sub but will repost here for your sake a great koan in zen buddhism who is the great master the magician that makes the grass green who creates reality and our experience the word yoga means union yoga comes from the same english root as the word yoke or to bring two things hitched together you need a human brain and the grass hitched together to make the yoga the greenness of the grass many believe it is very hard to be a mystic that you have to go through a lot of effort to realize your union with everything but actually you are experience your union with everything all the time otherwise you would not be experiencing anything at all a group of photons leave the sun travel just short of a million meters to reach earth where they fall onto a blade of grass the grass absorbs some wavelengths and reflects others some of the reflected ones travel in your direction and enter the tiny hole that is your iris which acts as a filter only allowing some wavelengths you can see in the photons finally end their epic journey as they are absorbed by your retina your retina gathers these signals not unlike a digital camera chip and converts them into an electric signal that travels to the vision center of your brain your brain then interprets the upsidedown image and ads your own judgement as a final last step and then magically you see the green grass insects and other animals dont have the same shape and size iris so they can see different colors or wavelengths of light we cant and visaversa the greenness of the grass is more to do with how our eyes work our nervous system than the grass alone you make the grass green you make your highs and you make your lows but you dont do it alone you are making it out of the union with the universe so everything is a conscience of contraries a conscience of you being there and the universe being there and everything is one at the same moment because there is no green without the grass and there is no green without you the greenness is a transaction that ties you and the grass together the world in a way is touching you by your eyes and retina but what we see is as good as our equipment if there are wavelengths of light we cant perceive because of the shape of our eyes are we seeing real reality because of this every perception is a gamble there is an infinite expanse of signals that are coming into our nervous system and being processed by our higher neuronal centers in the brain we are all organizing and orchestrating this information according to our own particular life history our genetic background our early imprints conditioning and learning so we are all living in different worlds and on a fundamental level it is amazing we can communicate at all you are the cocreator of the sights you see the sounds you hear with your own impression of the universe our experiences are generated by us we are not generating it out of nothing who we are generates it we are creating a reality tunnel we are experiencing from moment to moment so there is a total unity between you and the universe whether you are aware of it or not the universe you live in is your creationbut we are not doing it consciously when you have seen the one that who makes the grass green it is like meeting your own father in a crowd you have no doubt whatsoever everything that gets into your brain affects your reality tunnel your world view or your belief system bs three major things never believe fully in anyones belief system dont accept all dont believe in your own bs the universe consists of a series of nonsimultaneously apprehended events buky fulli any belif system or reality tunnel you have right is going to have to be revised and updated as you continue to apprehend new events later in time not simultaneously you cant apprehend you cant comprehend you cant perceive you cant understand the whole universe at once the universe is nonsimultaneously apprehended we go through life minute by minute second by second day by day we are never perceiving the same universe if we are it is because we stopped paying attention thats why you get bored youre not paying attention we cant apprehend the whole universe right now past present future all spacetime it takes nine years for signals to get here from sirus even think how long it would take to get here from the other end of the universe from the farthest galaxy so in terms of the theory of special relativity it is not the same time everywhere so the universe is nonsimultaneously apprehended that means our knowledge at any particular time is part of the universe and tomorrow we will know more maybe not much more maybe a lot more who knows man on donkey searching all over a town north south east and west someone cries out what are you looking for the man replies my donkey the donkey represents what everyone is looking for when they enter a mystic school it is the answer to all the riddles of the universe and you hunt for it north south east and west and all the time it is carrying you around it is the human nervous system which takes out of the infinities of the universe a reality tunnel that you create that you consider reality which is your own creation that you think is the whole of the universe unless you went to a sufi school or studied zen meditation or even dropped lsd then you may realize the universe is more complicated than any map we can make of it put the donkey on your back so you never forget that the master the great magician that makes the grass green he who creates the whole of the universe you live in further reading robert anton wilson

GetMotivated,removed,if you saw the top comment in that thread when it was on the front page it was basically explaining how that comic is terrible because it implies that you should only focus on the end result rather than the journey when the journey is of life
GetMotivated,removed,id be more motivated if tony bourdain didnt have the most chilllax lifestyle of going wherever in the world and getting as drunk as he possibly can when dealing with the most annoying of people and bitching freely about it on public television id be motivated under those circumstances too
GetMotivated,removed,it is an okay way to spend your life do whatever you want but kill yourself and youll eventually become desensitized to what that guy wants and he will become your friend not your enemy
GetMotivated,removed,with a cigarette in hand lol

GetMotivated,removed,dont settle read about it and be persuaded by memes i love this sub
GetMotivated,removed,this is bullshit now i get the idea is to motivate people to make a change if theyre not happy with their direction in life but at the same time way too many people in life lack psychological resilience they think everything needs to be just right for them fuck you need to read books you dont like sometimes maybe a teacher assigned it maybe youre in a book club and someone else got to choose this one and the restaurant thing stupid maybe someone invited you out maybe a favorite of someone else in your group and what about ordering pizza its an exercise in finding the least common denominator i dont like mushrooms yeah but i dont eat onions green peppers or black olives okay well i dont like sausage how about just pepperoni ugh i hate pepperoni goddamnit you fuckers i guess were eating cheese and marinara on white bread crust okay this one wasnt in the quote but it runs on the same principle you should never settle for anything you dont love heres the real motivation learn to deal bitch some goddamn resilience will do you wonders in life not only will you be happier if youre better able to adapt to your given circumstances and environment but youll be less of a pain in the ass to everyone around you winwin

GetMotivated,removed,tired of reading shit posts just stop
GetMotivated,removed,id just like to interject for moment what youre refering to as linux is in fact gnulinux or as ive recently taken to calling it gnu plus linux linux is not an operating system unto itself but rather another free component of a fully functioning gnu system made useful by the gnu corelibs shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full os as defined by posix many computer users run a modified version of the gnu system every day without realizing it through a peculiar turn of events the version of gnu which is widely used today is often called linux and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the gnu system developed by the gnu project there really is a linux and these people are using it but it is just a part of the system they use linux is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run the kernel is an essential part of an operating system but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system linux is normally used in combination with the gnu operating system the whole system is basically gnu with linux added or gnulinux all the socalled linux distributions are really distributions of gnulinux olo
GetMotivated,removed,yeah most of what is submitted to rgetmotivated doesnt seem to have been thought through doesnt stop it from getting to the front page though could be worse it could be as stupid as which somehow made it to the front page too

GetMotivated,removed,im sorry but as someone who has been a member of an organisation practising the art of coherently using words to form narratives and communicate messages would you please stop using the word introvert outside of its actual meaning propagating the misuse of the word is most frustrating as it makes communication about its actual meaning more troublesome for the rest of us
GetMotivated,removed,riddle and hes like shut up while i fuck this guy up and shes like no please dont hes only a child and then you beat the baby and raped her and you are only beginning to realize the gravity of your evil and satans greatest trick and almost all world leaders are secretly atheist because its a conceptual phase we go through whenever we begin to lose the thread and break the beautiful plot and reach a superior level of understanding we won the race congratulations lets clean up after ourselves and accept that the thing is also many diverse things because thats what bifurcation is but we dont mind being the fallguy for a bit because one begins to see the bigger picture gradually as it happens because im an atheist and the only logical conclusion of that is i dont exist so i must be a zombie or a robot or something because dead things dont exist so i guess i need to make some kind of global temple and call it earth and find myself there with science and other types of science until life is a scientific artform with grouptripping while we do scienceart because its time to take the wheel man and steer yourself out of the dogs bollocks and into thyself

GetMotivated,removed,keep them sec of negativity to yourself or i will spend my life fucking up yours welcome to internet
GetMotivated,removed,and to find himher quickly you would need to be going at it which would require investments in stimulants like cocaine maybe some weaponry for safety definitely a rental car like a maybach so as not to be recognized and at least one or two hookers so you dont look like a lonely creep
GetMotivated,removed,but money is a scarce resource we spend our lives acquiring and we need to have in order to keep living and having time is just the mere state of existing this is one of the stupider things i have seen on this sub and thats saying something

GetMotivated,removed,he made a generalization that is not enough to show weather he is intolerant towards all liberals however that missing the painting by focusing be on the brush strokes thing that is quite good and i think i might borrow that someday
GetMotivated,removed,i am as well more liberal than conservative at least
GetMotivated,removed,i hate having to spoon my poop out of my ass because of chronic constipation
GetMotivated,removed,these shit posts are insufferable
GetMotivated,removed,moral unsubscribe
GetMotivated,removed,cause hes gotta jack off to his parents
GetMotivated,removed,you should not take my word for gold but you could at least come with arguments to why im wrong yes im negative about this motivational quote but i am so with reasons if you become happy from working hard be my guest you may work for me hehe success is very possible without working hard if you do it smart i dont see working hard as a great thing i think it is a very sad thing being dependent on other people for your happiness by getting satisfaction from other peoples admiration it will likely set you up for great disappointment down the road when you realize no one really gives a shit in a profound way then you are empty working in silence may sound cool but has no real value this quote basically says that you must suffer so you can show other people how grate you are after you had success so after the success you are allowed to share your pride but before then you should stfu
GetMotivated,removed,this could be construed as a sexual comment thin people feel better on my body than pizza does through my butthole
GetMotivated,removed,being overweight kills you maybe while you were crossing the street and then you got run over
GetMotivated,removed,but the fact that being fat a lifestyle which impacts your life exactly fuck and all is widely ridiculed in western society which is wrong why do you think fat acceptance is a thing
GetMotivated,removed,this is false most people are overweight
GetMotivated,removed,or not eating like an asshole
GetMotivated,removed,rcringe
GetMotivated,removed,complains about fatphobia
GetMotivated,removed,if you are just trying to lose weight by working out its going to be painfully slow process and if you fall from the wagon you are likely to gain weight back fast
GetMotivated,removed,this image is far from the truth there is a reason obese people are and remain obese damn reddit just keeps getting dumber and dumber
GetMotivated,removed,this is very misleading it doesnt depend on how hard you actually work out every day it depends on your hormone levels someone with good hormone levels can trigger their metabolism in the gym someone with poor hormone levels cannot do that doesnt matter how hard they actually work out every day in fact if their hormone levels are low and they work out harder they will over train and experience muscle waste terrible advice this is an excellent example of why the internet sucks for this stuff also its highly likely that phelps was dropping steroids up to a certain point before the olympics steroids and other types of extreme supplementing are bigger than youd think and even if he doesnt juice up hes still going to be an extreme on the spectrum just because youre part of the of people who can live like youre saying eat whatever and hit the gym hard and be in great shape doesnt mean your experience is universal overweight people have crappy hormone balance they dont respond to lifting the same way you do some of the balance is thrown off by genetics lack of sleep or sedientary lifestyle body composition or stress or bad insulin sensitivity think about it from an evolutionary standpoint we have evolved to be very efficient at burning calories meaning the more fat we can store the better the majority of people are fighting their biology which has evolved to help them get fatter in other words a normal person cant expect the results you have gotten without steroids its ignorant to think so
GetMotivated,removed,false being fat takes no effort
GetMotivated,removed,bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,yes you never stated that exercise works better than exercise and i didnt say that you did but you implied that hypertrophy training and increasing demand are universally effective i simply pointed out that they are nonuniversal methods of success while diet is universal all of the people you train have lost fat how much you havent trained anyone who ate enough to offset their workouts youve never had a client with chronically low t chronic meaning it doesnt respond to exercise or other means of naturally raising it how long are the workouts how frequent first you say diet is essential then you say some people didnt diet and lost weight are your clients starting from morbidly obese or obese or just overweight as for me i only know what my doctors have told me and some light research here and there i normally i dont bring up my personal experiences as proof but since you did i work out with a team of guys we all do the same work out and some get ripped and some see little to no results we all do hypertrophy training and we all work out pretty hard and very consistently but you can see the difference in the guys who have better hormone levels they just get better results from the same work outs sometimes ill out rep them on every lift and then a few weeks later they shoot past me theres a reason people shoot up on roids hormones matter one of my buddies got tested and his hormones were out of wack his are easy because i can copy them out of my email low t low e horrible insulin sensitivity high cortisol low tsh high epo levels were low trh gnrh ghrh crh all low normal and leptin was high gastrin normal secretin normal cck normal normal glucagon normal adiponectin high he had me go in i had low t high cortisol and my thyroid was off indicating hypothyroidism but my doctor didnt run as much tests because my insurance doesnt cover as much my doctor is my buddys dad who has an mdphd in endocrinology he also runs an obesity clinic in my city that clinic is the root of my work out team how we all came together if youre a trainer and you havent worked with someone who sees little to no results from hypertrophy training then i would say youre really lucky and defying the odds or are you have trained very few people but since people who dont build muscle quickly are less likely to get a trainer then its actually not too surprising or maybe you train with roids and take hormones out of the equation
GetMotivated,removed,this sign is literally bullshit what it should say is the pain of doing things while over weight is far worse than the pain of someone in shape because in reality when youre out of shape and you need to go from point a to point b depending on how far it is and how fat you are its going to suck more than someone that is in shape
GetMotivated,removed,not really no
GetMotivated,removed,upvotes i thought this sub was about motivation but apparently you guys are all just fat
GetMotivated,removed,the only post on this sub ive upvoted
GetMotivated,removed,lets just get the typical rgetmotivated comments out of the way hork bork you cant do literally anything i could never be a dog living in space some people are more talented than others no matter how hard you try youll be worthless life sucks and then you die and what if i dont want to practice anything in life im perfectly content to sit on my ass all day why are you telling me what to do bob ross is a talentless hack this picture is shitty fuck everything
GetMotivated,removed,out of that means i win right this was the top by httpnpredditcomugiantflightlessbird another time this link was
GetMotivated,removed,hate speech discriminatory remarks or personal attacks none of these are you an sjw then
GetMotivated,removed,like when youre going to commit suicide
GetMotivated,removed,he wasnt even slightly talented as a painter
GetMotivated,removed,get fit with it works wwwbrittanywrapsmoremyitworkscom
GetMotivated,removed,because these morons dont understand i think the point to that rhetorical question was that it is backlash from a society which actively demonizes a society while not only abjectly marginalizing it but also enabling it that there is literally no reason for them to stay fat fuck you i do what i want seems like a good enough reason to me hell that should be the cornerstone of a freesociety live your life free from the incursions of others provided you offer the same courtesy take out their frustration on people who are trying to better themselves again as opposed to the inverse
GetMotivated,removed,saying being overweight doesnt impact your life at all is completely ignorant the impacts your life bit wasnt directed at the individual that would be retarded ofcourse it impacts your life any lifestyle impacts your life for better or worse i was referring to your life as an individual looking at someone who is obese from outside of their worldview
GetMotivated,removed,literally a life changer for me definite best thing thats happened to my mental for sure sorry for wall of texttheres a tldr at the bottom if you dont want to read a story i struggled a ton with anxiety and depression through high school life felt dull i hated myself and everyone else you know the usual i eventually got a girlfriend and life was better for a while knowing that someone cared but when we broke up after a while i got lonely lost all my self confidence and went into a mental slump every winter i got depressed and stopped leaving my room i got inspired to start lifting from a well known league of legends player because he shared my name we studied the same thing and he showed me that it was possible to be big without giving up your self gonna be honest it sucked at first doms soreness felt like shit everything hurt but i forced myself to keep at it because i heard exercise being touted as this effective treatment for depression and low self confidence after weeks i noticed i had delts in the mirror and thats when i fell in love with it seeing progress and doms goes away after a few weeks and it just becomes the best thing ever its been months now and ive put on almost pounds ive gotten tons of compliments from people i feel way stronger and the workouts and rock climbing are the highlight of my day lifting changes after a few weeks it goes from feeling like a sore piece of shit after a workout to feeling like a sore but hot person with a sick pump and you look forward to the gains youll get its now mid january and i feel amazing am doing lots of exercise and climbing and for the first time i feel good during the winter life is great obviously your mileage may vary but if you stick with it it could be a life changer at the very least youll feel stronger and look amazing at worst youll become a bit of a narcissist like me but that beats depression at least narcissists have the self confidence to get laid sometimes tldr im sure youve heard all these things from other comments i just wanted to share my story definitely get into exercise if youre heavy diet and do cardio if youre light eat more and lift harder to maximize appearance gains its easier if you have a gym buddy but not necessary check out rfitness and good luck my friend
GetMotivated,removed,my brain stopped working when i read rich dad poor dad it was like someone opened a bunch of fortune cookies found near wall streeta bunch of sayings but absolutely nothing that could be practically implemented a no respect for a guy who trashes is real father like this piece of shit did so he could make a buck
GetMotivated,removed,more patronizing bullshit obviously i know youre depressed besides the fact that you already explicitly stated it its obvious from what youve said about your life i told you ive been througham going through everything youve listed but youre missing the point entirely all you can think about is poor you i have a mental illness and thats to blame for everything and theres no way i can overcome it to make my life better end of story thats you do you think that thinking will help anything maybe youre right but the fact of the matter is if you dont believe in yourself if you dont believe in your future nothing is going to change and you might as well save yourself some trouble and just kill yourself now taking responsibility for your past and future is the only thing you can do what other options are there obviously you cant just believe your way out of depression that is not what im saying but if thats what you choose to hear thats your prerogative
GetMotivated,removed,have any of you had to deal with herpes how have you coped with it

GetMotivated,removed,oh pleeeeaaazzeee do you know how many beautiful people with top notch acting skills scrounge in los angeles to never find anything in the industry beyond being an extra scoring an acting gig is based on who you know and what you are willing to do for them for women especially who you know might want sexual favors for access to hollywood parties where they can rub elbows and do lines of blow with directors producers casting agents etc lets not forget the hollywood pedo ring where childrens movies are really just a ploy created by wealthy men who seek access to children i wouldnt be surprised if chris pratt has even had to suck a couple of old wrinkly dicks to a part
GetMotivated,removed,rthathappened
GetMotivated,removed,god forbid they stick with the actual characters ethnicity from the comic introducing fat chubby overweight tubby short tiny vertically challenged retarded superman

GetMotivated,removed,what a wastethere is plenty of tread left on those tires
GetMotivated,removed,when all else fails go for the race card no one will trump you on that im guessing youre the fatchubby i assume thats one in the same short asian in this story moron obviously pratt is phenomenally talented but all im saying is that it wouldnt be possible with his looks his biggest role was starlord it broke him out go look into asian prejudice in hollywood remember how chris rock got those little asian kids in the oscars yea go fuck yourself so yes lets get the race card im playing it you cliche turd and im guessing since you like being cliche i would assume you to be that pasty acne ridden basement dweller but well if youre not close to looking like one better work on it

GetMotivated,removed,because of the shit upvoted on this sub is garbage and is so vague or only works from a very particular point of viewcontext its easy to poke fun at shitty motivational memes like this this sub used to be more than shitty quotes on pictures
GetMotivated,removed,thats how you commit suicide dipshit
GetMotivated,removed,you would be wrong i did read them and ive even replied to them that doesnt answer my question though what makes this particular thing inherently dark is it the word jump thats making you think dark what if you just substituted the word jump for some other metaphor i mean thats all it is a metaphor this motivational quote has nothing to do with suicide in any shape or form i have a hard time believing you dont understand that
GetMotivated,removed,basically this sub is stupid
GetMotivated,removed,oh so now minorities cant get help when they feel like hurting themselves racist
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is just laughable
GetMotivated,removed,screw your blog thats just another lazy attempt at doing something worthwhile with your life without leaving the couch you lazy pile im an unmotivated piece of shit too ive spent more time fantasizing about when the mcrib returns back to the mcdonalds menu than what i want my lifes legacy to be so lets go halves on a bus and start our own internet road tripping show or not it doesnt really matter ill still be laying here on my bean bag chair eating cold spaghettios
GetMotivated,removed,you havent lived life until youve eaten a raccoon meat and rubber sandwich aka the mcrib everyone is writing blogs thinking complete strangers value their lame thoughts few are telling their bosses to choke on their nuts and video blogging a never ending antisheep road trip that may or may not encounter their own kidnapping and wild voodoo torture in south america along the way

GetMotivated,removed,sorry thought i was on rcirclejerk
GetMotivated,removed,lol spoken like a true ignoramus who never studied and chose to be a sycophant instead stealing ideas be like water uttered to pierre burton in an interview he was basicaly trying to present himself as a philosopher but really was lifting simple taoist concepts wing chun lies he met ip man but didnt study with him so much as he learned a little of the system from wong shun leung he barely made it through teh studies when he went to america to be a cha cha dancing champion he didnt learn any traditional kung fu really and was more interested in being a movie star he never once had a sanctioned fight against anyone everything was always a demo he would bad mouth many maybe hes your god but to many hes just one more bmovie actor trying to get to the alist an never succeeding
GetMotivated,removed,dude its about black people youre not admitting it but theres no other reason to get salty about the stereotype that white men cant jump honest question why else would it rankle your fur that people are lightheartedly joshing white people unless youre bitter that your own opinions about black people are socially unacceptable follow up question would you identify someone who does believe in socially unacceptable stereotypes as a racist

GetMotivated,removed,bullshit try having some friends who live far away when you have enough such people its hard to keep talking to each one on one in a meaningful way fb provides a less obtrusive method for that events are the real big one of course if most of your friends are at work or something its easy to invite them in person but if theyre scattered inviting people to some event is easiest done online you could use emails or such but its messy fb makes it pretty optimal to keep track of who is going whos a maybe and who isnt while also allowing comments and all the necessary information to be there you can make events private or maybe semiprivate or even public if you know what youre doing further fb doesnt have to be used for friends you say some of these people are not your friends anyway i say so what you can have people in your life that you want to get more involved with local pages can be useful for finding people to hang out with or make new friends theyre so useful for small groups pretty much all my local casual sporting groups have used them to keep track of whos going to games and all theyre also useful for communicating with local businesses you dont need an account to view the business page useful for viewing details about events hours etc but you do to ask them questions and lots of them are happy to answer questions on fb in a timely manner

GetMotivated,removed,your friend sounds like a bit of a prick assuming he exists
GetMotivated,removed,his name albert fucking einstein
GetMotivated,removed,this is so obtuse and stupid its obviously easier for the faster runner to run a greater distance in less time just as its easier for a stronger person to lift a heavier object
GetMotivated,removed,but it was relatively easy for him to run the mile in minutes
GetMotivated,removed,my cheeks hurt from reading the comments hahaha i would never trade reddit for facebook never
GetMotivated,removed,this sounds like one of those stories hipsters make up to get laid

GetMotivated,removed,liar
GetMotivated,removed,awww you selfless prick thanks for the story though
GetMotivated,removed,waiting for raging ratheist neckbeards to hate this guy to death
GetMotivated,removed,upvoted but sadly you wont see much traction for truth in this sub its not feel good enough when you realize that in order to be good at something you have to focus on the narrow window of things that you have natural talents for such as not playing for alabama if you are a short guy who cannot gain muscle mass
GetMotivated,removed,id let you eat my ass
GetMotivated,removed,oh just do the shit that used to make me happy why didnt i think of that honestly go fuck yourself

GetMotivated,removed,well then that proves it doesnt it
GetMotivated,removed,plus a video of him drunk where he actually says that he will always be faithful to his wife
GetMotivated,removed,there is no source hes showed up to press conferences acting tweaks and theres one video of him completely wasted being hit in by some hoes in which he denies he would ever be unfaithful to his wife conor has his faults but unfaithfulness isnt one of them
GetMotivated,removed,you realized you pulled this out of your ass right just because you have your own insecurities doesnt mean you get to slander whoever you want cunt
GetMotivated,removed,he didnt before he was famous he does because money also borderline pedo
GetMotivated,removed,look at you spreading lies to cover for your hero hahah theyre not hookers though theyre irish girls and while theres no coke in the pictures its a well known fact he enjoys it
GetMotivated,removed,damn people no one said that guy is a saint or that you should quit your job and hit the gym yeah most people trying that strategy wont reach his level of success this sub is not about finding the secret formula for success there isnt one its for browsing when you could a little bit of motivation for something this might not work for you but it works for others
GetMotivated,removed,i think its funny that people using this sub immediately shit on anything and everything posted i come here to get motivated and be positive and everyone in the comments just immediately tear into everything and fill it with negativity and poor me shit guess what its simple you work hard apply your skills and you either fail or succeed and then you try again stop making it seem hopeless for everyone else because its fucking not
GetMotivated,removed,patrick
GetMotivated,removed,i used to be i quit easily easier than cigarettes and way easier than opiates
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think so he said feminism is bad and has ruined the women of the west that and the asian thing is a pretty common neckbeardyredpillian thing to say i found plenty of women like that here in the us
GetMotivated,removed,hes not doing anything guilty in these pictures
GetMotivated,removed,its hilarious he had a few upvotes before the pendulum swung i really think a lot of the hate on feminism is a bunch of man children realzing they have to own their shit their moms wont be there to cook and clean for them and they wont have a housewife to cook and clean all the time for them because shes gonna be working too me and gf havent moved in yet but i know i will do half the chores and cook for her as often as she cooks for me shes lucky the one time i have cooked for her it was bomb
GetMotivated,removed,where do you feel him
GetMotivated,removed,too bad conor is actually a piece of shit doing coke and fucking stippers instead of being faithfull to this wonderful woman ¯ツ¯
GetMotivated,removed,its true that our perspectives are definitely different and what we see is completely different from the inside id consider myself and everyone i know alright but of course i do for the sexism limited choices thing id give a small summary of the mozart problem nannerl mozart was wolfgangs older sister considered his equal if not his superior in most aspects upon reaching maturity she was forced to stop performing and composing because of her gender this is not speculation this is known and openly stated fact i like this example because its about as close as we can get to controlling the starting inputs ond observing the effects have things changed for sure are there still intense undercurrents of this phenomenon also for sure its a complicated problem and its a disservice to pretend like we have a blank slate all of a sudden im not sure what the answer is but its not ignoring history and unfortunately the data can be tortured to say there is or isnt a wage gap depending on what you want to hear and who you seek out to tell you things i agree with you that this time would be better spent on gaming though hah hah
GetMotivated,removed,and then the man became a pretentious douchebag who got knocked the fuck out by a contender that doesnt have any belt way to go
GetMotivated,removed,lol shes waiting to get married and divorce him for half his money i guarantee it it would be foolish to leave him now that shes used to that lifestyle

GetMotivated,removed,characterized by assumption of dignity or importance especially when exaggerated or undeserved none of it was exaggerated or undeserved although unsuccessful his every word could be backed up by his performances dominating his opponents and being undefeated it was far from all mouth although a douchebag in his act he isnt pretentious
GetMotivated,removed,moral of the story be an unemployed guy that works out all the time and you can bang a who works to support you
GetMotivated,removed,the second you have to quit something its no longer super easy
GetMotivated,removed,behind every douchebag there is a woman who is afraid to get beat up
GetMotivated,removed,hey man he has over confirmed kills
GetMotivated,removed,this like a month ago there was a photo of him on the front page getting pissed at the photographer taking a snap of him while he was partying with coke and hookers
GetMotivated,removed,ya i was thinking about it this whole time one of the key parts of being ignorant as that you are you are not aware of the fact you are ignorant so its normal that you dont feel that you are dumb
GetMotivated,removed,cock and ball torture
GetMotivated,removed,me too nothing like a little fractal madness to reset the clock for the year

GetMotivated,removed,thats all this sub is full of bad advice and contradictions
GetMotivated,removed,can i get some examples
GetMotivated,removed,i kinda think hes an ass
GetMotivated,removed,why would anyone expect pewdiepie to actually do that its unreasonable
GetMotivated,removed,it included some of what was initially promised so many fans are saying the game is fixed
GetMotivated,removed,they betrayed the audiences expectations but it didnt grow their audience the expectations are what caused the audience to grow the betrayal happened after
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think that being combative will help the artist but they should ignore their audience for the most part if you have an audience then theyre there to see your work you should be true to your work and not change based on outside opinion
GetMotivated,removed,terry pratchetts trolls

GetMotivated,removed,i havent seen it hes a dummy
GetMotivated,removed,yea bro dont cry bro this is just usual testosterone bro typical bro science bro
GetMotivated,removed,starting from nothing has taught me to value what i gain it has also introduced me to the biggest insult i have experienced some stupid sjw at my college completely invalidated me by claiming i was the product of white privilege the only one between the two of us attending on a paycheck from mommy and daddy was the sjw
GetMotivated,removed,yet i bet you support clinton lol
GetMotivated,removed,i have cock big cocks
GetMotivated,removed,i didnt get any satisfaction from this whatsoever the last thing she said might as well have been fuck you son
GetMotivated,removed,what if her heart stops mid conversation
GetMotivated,removed,in the end it doesnt matter ill rather be free and actually get the benefits of my country rather than be oppressed and my country doing well without me getting a single benefit all you see is facts you have never lived there you probably havent been there and you havent felt the racism like the people who actually have facts wont tell you all the racial divides that people face and still face they havent mastered yet the art of equality as they still got their head stuck in the apartheid mindset were all whites are racist and blacks must be given everything on a silver platter i hope maybe people who think apartheid was better for south africa to one day face all the troubles facing nonwhites so they can understand the hurt of not been accepted by your own country next time think about been oppressed and a nonwhite point of view rather than facts on the internet
GetMotivated,removed,this is profoundly stupid stupid to the point where you have to wonder if this is trolling wannabes
GetMotivated,removed,this makes me want to die i dont think this sub is working

GetMotivated,removed,no shit thats completely irrelevant to the topic in question
GetMotivated,removed,yeah you are right the only correct way to wish someone well is to let them kill themselves because clearly everyone who has ever decided to commit suicide had perfect judgement and absolutely no other way out
GetMotivated,removed,where do i sign up for die
GetMotivated,removed,less of a roll more of a pistonlike maneuver
GetMotivated,removed,because id rather have the person who hit me pay for the dent than pay for it myself do you know what i mean by subrogation that means im not paying for it i cover the costs up to my deductible while my insurance company assumes their duty to defend and attempts to get the other insurance company to reimburse me im not using insurance to pay for a dent moron im using them to recover my costs from the person at fault in the accident congratulations youre just another ignorant person on the internet
GetMotivated,removed,you know damn well its not the smoky eye makeup thats an overused deflection that every woman uses when you point out the fact that they look like shit without makeup and they wouldnt have an ounce of their over inflated selfesteem and sassiness if it werent for the fact that theyre wearing a mask
GetMotivated,removed,i have no idea wtf youre talking about but your attitude is completely inappropriate for this sub
GetMotivated,removed,take the belligerent attitude and leave this sub is getmotivated not gethostile

GetMotivated,removed,she all be like how i gonna march over this
GetMotivated,removed,this guy has the best point the guy has way less potential strength as a result of losing pounds of limbs he technically has to hop legged to even reach the wall seeing as how he has less leg to jump with he actually has pounds back since he didnt lose his full arm and also hes wearing a prosthetic leg which last i checked isnt weightless
GetMotivated,removed,but there is less of him that he needs to pull up over
GetMotivated,removed,he would win an ass kicking contest with ease

GetMotivated,removed,todays media often portrays the love yourself everyone is beautiful agenda when there is an obesity epidemic in the us this is the kind of inspiring story people need to see being overweight is a problem and these are the kind of positive steps everyone needs to take well done
GetMotivated,removed,i care and im someone so go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,wow i cant even right now why is this gat shaming garbage on the front page women are healthy at any size

GetMotivated,removed,you know i used to hate this sub but now im working out and trying to get my life together i realize i just hated myself
GetMotivated,removed,obesity had many comorbidities such as hypertension diabetes and many others those disease right there are a huge burden on the economy as far as healthcare costs go what happens when people cant pay for their own care it essentially ends up coming out of taxes
GetMotivated,removed,ive seen the research on this smokers for instance cost less in the long run because they usually end up with fairly fatal problems obesity causes a lot of intensive care to be neeeded for the person
GetMotivated,removed,people come in all shapes and sizes naturally and no one can question that some models you see on fashion show catwalks have bodies that are much skinnier than is natural and even healthy there is however a significant amount of men and women who are way above what they naturally should be and this causes a huge amount of problems for themselves and society organizations such as the national association to advance fat acceptance lobby for different causes such as lowering the weight limit for obesity to be considered a disability and stopping airlines charging for two seats when required for a larger person this and articles such as and advocate the acceptance and even accommodation of being overweight and do you remember when oprah announced she was going to try and lose weight again and her social media was bombarded with people saying she was a disgrace and that she should accept her weight
GetMotivated,removed,people shouldnt be triggered by another persons obesity it seems like people cant get over others weight and lash out on them speaking sense in words that hurt and that doesnt work it agitates be niceits not too much and therell be less to be offended about some will be offended still but less so than now
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is so much fun every day someone attempts to brighten up your day only to be mercilessly picked apart by a bunch of people who are supposedly trying to motivate themselves but instead poke holes in any attempt to do so do we really have to be so condescending in a light hearted sub
GetMotivated,removed,well theyd have to be pretty sick you can be overweight and healthy but obesity is more than just being overweight blood pressure increases exponentially with overweight and id guess that is the case with cholesterol as well put those two together and youll get heart failure before youre forty its pretty daunting when you look at the data heart issues are the number one health risks in the us and tons of other countries so decreasing their numbers is absolutely essential
GetMotivated,removed,what youre trying to say is they need a lifestyle changing working out is a lifestyle change once you get into that lifestyle although extremely hard to keep doing it as humans like to take easy road instead it becomes your lifestyle instead of im trying to get to goal many people stop working out just bc they seem to stagnate or gain weight not knowing thats where you keep pushing it anytime you lose weight and then start gaining weight means youre gaining muscle most likely which is great for your health body mind soul and looks good youre filling in the skin and tightening it from what your fat ass push out for the last years remember working out is a lifestyle change its not ill fit working out in my schedule it becomes a way of life to those girls and guys who are afraid to pick up weights bc they dont want to look like the big strong veiny muscular women i say this you cant get to that level even if you tried a person does not just magically get jacked that is dozens of years of year and targeting muscle groups with increased weight on purpose and tons of chemicals many using steroids or a type of steroid so go run but for gods sake pick up some weights and train
GetMotivated,removed,she instantly came to mind shes a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,i gotta admit man i would trade all the extra iq points i hadhave for just ignorant happiness i would like to be surprised by those around me to appreciate and cherish moments in my life with my loved ones it seems to be a real struggle though when i look at my kids i just see all the failures the missed opportunities to better myself and their futures i see all the people i was a dick to because i thought i was so damned smart i have two autistic daughters and i used to make fun of the kids in special ed funny part about getting up on that high horse is that its stationary and doesnt allow you to move through life with the rest of the herd one day you notice from that intellectual tower that build up like a fortress that everyone else is moving forward with their light mobile caravans while you sit entrenched in the same spot for me personally it feels like the only opportunities ive afforded myself at this point are chances not to make things worse i have a dead end job i cant stand but i make enough to keep up with the bills i have to move out of my house because my self loathing has really stretched my family to limits i just got out of a short stay psychiatric facility for psychosis last tuesday and that almost cost me job child protective services are now involved in my life and i cant be around my kids unsupervised the irony is my oldest stepdaughter is weeks away from being old enough to be the adult supervision so my wife doesnt have to do it i have burned all professional and personal bridges over the past decade im stagnant in all avenues of my life except for depression which seems to coming in tsunami like waves almost daily at this point i have lost faith and hope for stability and happiness this is all done by my own hand i made this bed that i have to lie now i think you and i differ in one very key aspect which is momentum sounds like you still have it keep it run with it fuel that fucker and make the changes you need to dont stop moving for any reason i did and it just doesnt make things any better for you especially when youre smart enough to realize what a dumb ass mistake it was in the first place
GetMotivated,removed,most obese people live to be almost as old as the average healthy weight person for the most severe class of obesity the average lifespan reduction is at most about years however due to comorbidities like diabetes cardiovascular diseases joint problems and increased risk of several varieties of cancer obese people become unhealthy much sooner than healthy weight people and require treatment for a longer period medical intervention for the obese is also more expensive than for healthy weight people while also being less effective they require special more expensive equipmentoperating tables larger mri macines etc they cause lifting injuries for hospital staff and emergency medical personnel they are more likely to have unfavorable outcomes from treatment from wounds not healing to being unable to perticipate in physical therapy due to weight essentially it is expected that health care costs will go up for everyone as the age and most of their lifetime health care costs will come at the end of life that is the same for all weight classes however obese people will also have significantly higher health care costs over the rest of their lives as well their end of life care will also be more expensive due to required accomodations for their weight sources

GetMotivated,removed,why being a social outcast and not having a good thought process isnt suffering this is the original comment i responded to neither of those statements are necessarily true and even if they were this person absolutely was making a statement about how it would make someone feel im sure your life experiences whatever they may be are more useful than my special education experience though so go ahead and continue arguing your objective facts in circles youre being a troll and obviously have a lot to learn about disabilities autonomy and dignity
GetMotivated,removed,what a load of shit i require someone to keep me from being myself the more i grow as an individual the more evil and despicable i become
GetMotivated,removed,so youre telling me that if you watched your partner get second and third degree burns you wouldnt stay with them and make sure theyre okay and be there for support because theyre in excruciating pain youd just go to your friends house to play video games if so youre an uncaring prick and youre exactly the type of person im talking about

GetMotivated,removed,actually calling tons of people who were not racist racist and trying to police culture constantly is what led to where we are now this current state of culture in the us i believe is partly due to an overreach by progressive ideologues scaring people is actually what got us into this situation
GetMotivated,removed,ah but nihilism brought me to this sub

GetMotivated,removed,it means a play on words but it was a shitty one because the quote was from ustellacampus whose weakness was his faggotry
GetMotivated,removed,this sub pisses me off im out
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you mate im like what the fuck am i going to do bite his goddamn ankles

GetMotivated,removed,gods hate him mortals want to be him
GetMotivated,removed,thanks doctor but no ask anyone who has gone to war they all miss the feeling it becomes a rush
GetMotivated,removed,you are choosing to end your existence so what if you dont choose the exact time and place youre still making that choice lets say you didnt age and you couldnt die of accidents or diseases would you still choose mortality if you answer yes then you would literally have to commit suicide if you answer no then the issue isnt really about mortality at all you just dont want to get old and sick
GetMotivated,removed,nice repost
GetMotivated,removed,even rgetmotivated has trolls i wont be feeding you anymore

GetMotivated,removed,dont live in extremes find the middle way which is not going in between the extremes the middle way is the way which is embracing both of the extremes
GetMotivated,removed,comments section gave me aids bunch of degenerate liberals who think everyone should be equal to achieve fairness thats not how it works work hard get rewarded and increase fairness my advice quit being liberals whiners and grind
GetMotivated,removed,and obviously the point youre striving to make is that a capitalistic society is fair let me ask is the current economic climate in america fair
GetMotivated,removed,but greed is inherent to the financial sector is it not you must grow to survive else you will be obsolete yes
GetMotivated,removed,yea ill remember this the next time i have a nightmare about my rape about how its my broken idea of fairness this fucking sub is full of shit people we lock up in the usa people for smoking a fucking plant put them in a fucking cage we laugh about how people will be raped in there then we turn around and let the bankers steal our fucking money the politicians lie to get elected and poison us and our children ceos who would rather you pay for their business with your taxes than actually contribute to a damn thing yet its our broken idea of fairness how about you shit people stop victim blaming for fucks sake get motivated to be an asshole is what this sub really is im sorry life is fucking unfair and if you work to only make gains for yourself fuck everyone else then you are a a net negative to society and you deserve nothing i blame the system but i blame you lying thieving pieces of shit more you deserve nothing
GetMotivated,removed,in other words fuck you poor people
GetMotivated,removed,dude this guys a joke haha
GetMotivated,removed,true so if you want to succeed become an emotionless ruthless power tripping animal remember its your broken idea that all people are equal thats the real problem no one is equal or more important than yourself of course you cant openly admit or talk about all of that so keep it to yourself be good at appearing kind considerate and mindful about others be real good at it its important keep that good guygal facade going on publicly and walk away as soon as youre discovered
GetMotivated,removed,this is exactly my problem with feminists who get pissed off when someone says dont go to frat parties and get black out wasted yeah in a perfect world you wouldnt be afraid of random teenage strangers raping you in this world though maybe you shouldnt do things that significantly increase your chances of getting raped im not saying its your fault im just saying if your concern is results and not what should happen you have to make choices based on the real world
GetMotivated,removed,this post is stupid as shit if i make cheeseburgers im not in competition with the guy who made milkshakes rather i trade half of my cheeseburgers for half of his milkshakes saying life is all about competing is like saying the milkshake dude is trying to make more milkshakes than i can make cheeseburgers everybody has different talents and skills just use your talents and skills to help others and trade for the product of labor from those who are more talented and skilled in other areas fuck this stupid as piss article
GetMotivated,removed,this feels less like rgetmotivated and more like rbrutalrealism
GetMotivated,removed,this is the first comment of yours that ive upvoted does a good job of adding context to the others i think youre coming off as more aggressive and dickish than you intend to or are just one guys thoughts and perspective take it as you will
GetMotivated,removed,this is such utter bs i dont live this way at all i dont chase money or people im happy with what i have
GetMotivated,removed,httpsyoutubeftroahxwas
GetMotivated,removed,rlatestagecapitalism
GetMotivated,removed,nice guys finish last
GetMotivated,removed,well yeah obviously my idea of fairness isnt working because those on the top of the ladder wintrade and leave naught but scraps for everyone else the system is broken and the cheaters should be banned
GetMotivated,removed,yeah dude i think his father failed and gave up and that means i think people with cancer deserve to die no you fucking idiot all i said was its possible if you just keep working at it and keep learning youre the type to think your lack of success is equatable to a terminal illness youre the cancer
GetMotivated,removed,unions supporting laws to harm black people were not the source of apartheid they were caused by apartheid this isnt rocket science it kind of goes like this there is conflict between blacks whites whites create a a system of racial segregation segregation is apartheid a law that says you must pay all workers at a very high rate did not create segregation it created less employment for blacks causality flows in one direction
GetMotivated,removed,im going to assume that you are trolling me but in case you arent httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalpartysouthafrica
GetMotivated,removed,wow gold for complete and total bullshit thats pathetic even for worthless morons on reddit standards its not difficult to understand that life is incredibly unfair thats what wealth and power does it gives you the ability to acquire more wealth and power so obviously the effect is compounded only a serious traitor claims that your standards of fairness are wrong when looking at the world with capitalism literal treason

GetMotivated,removed,great quote that what i really need to do in these days
GetMotivated,removed,and dont post there if you care about being banned from a bunch of shitty subs
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,life happiness is about viewing the world objectively if you had a relatively stable upbringing and dont suffer from a personality disorder yourself this objectivity will likely come fairly naturally to you if you do have a personality disorder you will find it difficult if not impossible to view life objectively this is because personality disorders cause one have difficulty controlling their emotions and how those emotions affect their perception of reality in essence they are unable to regulate their feelings creating their reality which allows for the disregard of fact based objective based decision making and emotions if you grew up in an unstable or abusive environment you do have the ability to view the world objectively and just accept it but it is likely you will require some counselling and support to overcome the remnants of this abuse or to remove yourself from the abusive situation and view the world objectively if this topic is striking a chord with you i recommend you visit httpoutofthefogwebsite and learn about pd and what it looks like to be a sufferer or victim of pd
GetMotivated,removed,bro you might get far that way but you hinder the lives of a bunch of other people by stepping on them to get whatever you want you may not be as empathetic as i am or at all for that matter but someday youll finally realize that those people you walk over are more powerful as a unit than you are as an individual its not about me being better than you its about the well being of your neighbors who all have the common interest of making a greater future if we simply stop undermining each other no one cares what you think or what youve become they care about what you do
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,this is fucking stupid no one will ever completely figure life out doing so would be impossible life is constantly changing with one unexpected challenge after another you have to realize life works that way so that you really focus on always making the present moment the best that you can the mindset in the picture will just set you up for future disappointment
GetMotivated,removed,thats the irony of this sub in the end it changes nothing you have to change shit like this might be just right to get you to decide to make necessary changes or not if not typically it feels like mocking

GetMotivated,removed,i actually considered telling you nicely that its not entirely normal to call a girl from a video clip whom you never met the person i love and to come up with a convoluted lifechanging plan to get to meet her but it just didnt have the same amount of zing i thought you could use a bit of a shakeup
GetMotivated,removed,you should seriously seek professional help and also check out the christina grimmie case i get that you have a dream but seriously the way you are phrasing this it makes you sound mental anything that you do in life do it for yourself everything else will fall into place

GetMotivated,removed,because they have served our country how does that not make them more important than some random crackhead i find that douchebags like you appreciate all the freedoms that veterans fight for but forget how they came about i would imagine that if i were to beat the shit out of you the first thing youd wind up doing is call one of those thug cops to help you
GetMotivated,removed,heres a bitcoin address to donate to so as to facilitate the purchase of materials to help her out
GetMotivated,removed,they absolutely do not make anyone more free anywhere thats disgusting propaganda and you should drop it they give up their freedoms for an easy job with a pay check thats what they do they dont do it for any other reason the majority of men and women in the military come from impoverished backgrounds they arent gungho they are bleeding red white and blue thats just the dumb southern hicks that join up most join up because they have few options and the military is the single largest form of welfare in the country that said they absolutely deserve anything theyve contracted for and they sadly do not get anything like the services they are promised they are lied to nonstop abused and thrown away when all is said and done the va is garbage and i know intimately how bad the va is and its a testament to how lowly we really place military personnel we want to feel good at parades and watch brown people die on tv but we dont want to pay the money weve promised to take care of these people and no they dont deserve respect beyond what anyone else deserves they arent doing anything special its a job a bad job and they generally dont qualify for better ones the army sounds better than taco bell thats the calculus involved weve been dumping recent vets into the police force now with no legitimate transition training and now weve got a violent biased insane police system its not the vets fault its our fault weve created this shit storm by worshiping them as gods at the same time we place them in a corner with no where to turn to the us is a vile place are there worse places yes but the us is a vile racist violent place that destroys young people to kill brown people abroad

GetMotivated,removed,honestly this sub kinda blows on every post its just people whining and complaining about shit and how the quote is not accurate its ridiculous
GetMotivated,removed,guy i dont get the reason you feel the need to pretend to be someone else when posting to getmotivated just use the other account you have like you do for all the other submissions youre really an odd one
GetMotivated,removed,what about dylan roof the unabomber zodiac murderer the georgetown koolaid guy etc
GetMotivated,removed,also no one wants to hear your out of breath convoluted crap about new years habits and goals and resolutions and shit do you wonder why youre capping at views per vlog because theyre boring they have bad lighting bad audio and half of the video is usually a continuous shot of first person mountain biking theyre also entirely too long minutes are you joking also the thing youre going for the casey neistat vibe doesnt work when you dont do interesting shit like he does everyday all you do is hike and ride your bike also he doesnt beg for sponsors in his videos your vlogs feel like a year olds inane rambling from being too wrapped up in delusions of grandeur about his own life which as it happens is exactly what it is so i guess that makes sense
GetMotivated,removed,heyno virtual reality is based on physical reality video games can have a lot of inspiring moments and different ways of thinking and looking at things that could carry over into life mario helped free society from the mafia it showed everyone that italians were going around stomping on everyone and fucking their bitches that shit wont fly in man zelda helped with gay rights it showed people that men in tights fairies and princesses could all be cool gta gave rise to third wave feminists and special snowflakes because people realized that psychopaths were people too pacman helped end hunger but ironically created an obesity epidemic by teaching an entire generation of americans that eating until you die was hip and lets not forget space invaders it taught the world that foreigners should be eradicated before that can become part of your society you see all of the great things about our world today are all thanks to video games so before you go bully another kid timmy think about things from his perspective screen fades to end card as triumphant music plays
GetMotivated,removed,yup this sub is a bundle of irony but whatever xd
GetMotivated,removed,no its not thats the entire point you literally dont climb mountains to be seen so rather than be motivated to accomplish something in real life to be admired be like a mountainclimber and do it to see the world holy fuck this sub sometimes how did this comment get upvotes and its parents
GetMotivated,removed,alright im officially done with this sub it is stamped life hack like they even know what that means see you all over at rgetdisciplined discipline trumps motivation every day of the week
GetMotivated,removed,you misunderstand the point many of us had harsh childhoods no friends no supportive parents we didnt really excel at anything in particular etc how can a kid like that find any motivation in life whatsoever and to us the answer was videogames they taught as so much not to mention making as believe in ourselves i myself was in that exact situation the only reason why i wasnt depressed was because i was never happy to begin with so i thought it was normal to be considered a piece of shit i had no confidence playing videogames on their maximum difficulty made me believe ii can do it i takes effort and time but its possible it was the starting point for me changing my life around it made me believe in myself when nothing else did
GetMotivated,removed,just scrolled back up to see legs arent that bad i suppose
GetMotivated,removed,christ the comments in here are ridiculous if you dont like this sub ir the content that gets posted here stick to your gaming and anime subs instead

GetMotivated,removed,ech this sub makes me depressed far more frequently than it motivates me i should probably unsubscribe i didnt wake up for any reason other than my body wouldnt let me stay unconscious any longer believe me i tried and the only thing i ever dream about is how i would end things on my own terms i have no other interests to pursue than this all coming to a close life feels like i woke up at a party and am completely unhappy there and just want to go but despite that i had no say in being at the party everyone i care about will feel like i ruined the party for them if i leave im trapped because i dont want to fuck up the lives of those i care about because im sympathetic towards them and then in the back of my head im always thinking well if i just went through with killing myself theyre feelings wouldnt be my problem anymore anyway until then the only thing i want is money despite that i hate every way ive ever come across it that way im no burden on those i care about and can only be a burden to myself
GetMotivated,removed,i wrote up a really long thing and i think it might help you as well take a look if youre interested
GetMotivated,removed,yes i did fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,because i do believe that there is no reason i am an atheist i think like just is and i find more beauty in that than i would with in a religion religions are imperfect none of them really make sense i refuse to follow an unjust god on the principal that an unjust god does not deserve following i believe that a very long time ago then was a big bang and that caused everything that has ever happened i believe life evolved from nothing under the perfect conditions which exist elsewhere in the universe as well i believe that there is no reason because there is no purpose and the purpose of life is to find purpose i say this because there is no purpose but its human nature to need one human nature which evolved over billions of years from inanimate objects so perhaps no i believe the reason for life is the big bang random chance and time apart from that there is no purpose which is why i started everything by saying there is no preset purpose in life you have to make your own
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,yeah well im not a shark how is this supposed to motivate me

GetMotivated,removed,yeah fuck you trees
GetMotivated,removed,most people who have lamborghini anythings were handed something earlier in life this is not just a possesion people get by working hard some people yes they earned it but that number is miniscule
GetMotivated,removed,as someone who has had his drive ebb and flow ive found that there are sources of motivation internal and external right now youre at a location that attempts to motivate you externally you are trying to grab parcels and bits of wisdom that change your perspective in such a way as to get you moving if only for a short while people often say that motivation doesnt last well neither does bathing thats why we recommend it daily zig ziglar the other motivator is internal most high achievers at least the individuals who consistently do well at the tasks they are handed do so because of a strong drive to do well for themselves on their own scale in their own way the solution for you then is obvious find your own type of motivation and figure things out from there if you arent motivated still you might as well kill yourself billions of people in this world have come and gone making progress in one way or another all so you can bitch on your miracle of a computer if you cant stop complaining about not getting enough from the things that others are giving you ie crappy motivational memes maybe suicide is the best solution for you but do so in such a way as to martyr yourself for a cause you believe in or maybe just maybe stop being a twat and be thankful for the things you have
GetMotivated,removed,than you for disproving op i hate this subreddit

GetMotivated,removed,yes this culture of achievism is not healthy or conducive to happiness the thing that causes unhappiness in the first place is the belief that happiness will come later such as when youre productivity master or thinner or whatever its already here and people are missing it because they think its dependent on achieving something thank you also this comic blows be grateful to present self fuck you present self but forgive your present self like wtf comic writer
GetMotivated,removed,i havent seen bojack but that video was really good at describing the problem but really shitty at providing solutions it basically wrote out the options as distract yourself and try to forget a nonoption suicide seemingly the only option somehow accept it and distract yourself a nonoption so basically distract yourself or kill yourself the former doesnt work and the latter is continually discouraged on top of that suicide really isnt an answer anyway because once you figure things out you realize reincarnation is correct so you just have distract yourself and try to forget about the whole issue in the first place but really theres no way to forget the problem still exists regardless of whether you try to run away so i guess i have a lot in common with this bojack guy in that regard looking for a solution that doesnt exist and unhappy with the really options laid out for me
GetMotivated,removed,who is this supposed to motivate exactly maybe me kind of motivated to tell you to go fuck yourself go fuck yourself

GetMotivated,removed,how is this motivating the whole point of these posters is to advocate for not changing youre perfect right now no need to change its just telling me im sufficient so i dont need to strive so hard for improvement almost every post herei always get onto people for being overly pedantic about a short succinct statement meant to convey a much larger idea they treat it like its supposed to fully unpack the application and idea in a matter of wordsits unreasonable but this postthis is genuinely ridiculous this sub is about getting motivated to improve yourself and make progressnot settle with where you are exactly what this quote is encouraging doesnt even belong here

GetMotivated,removed,it was pretty wack he did some of the customary thank former coaches and teammates routine but he did a lot more i told you soing jordan called out by name the coach who didnt put him on the varsity roster in grade as well as the player who got that last spot on the team over him both of those guys were in attendance he basically said a huge fuck you to anybody who he had ever perceived as doubting slighting or saying something bad about him he took what would usually be a time for cheery reminiscing about a great career and made it pretty bitter and spiteful to see a year old man being so petty about things that happened years ago was just too wild
GetMotivated,removed,but in real life hes an ass to people makes total sense
GetMotivated,removed,why do you praise this asshole fuck this douchebag
GetMotivated,removed,sjws post this on their facebook timelines and then think now lets go find somebody thats wrong about things

GetMotivated,removed,damn it not again
GetMotivated,removed,i meant that more as commentary on the shitshow that is the current us presidential election race the sad state of affairs that reddit has become courtesy of the folks that frequent rthedonald and similar its to the point that i literally cannot tell if a person posting something like that genuinely likes trump or is a shitposting ironic troll
GetMotivated,removed,i dont believe going to class is suffering nor do i think most or even very many professors are pricks in years of undergrad and another years of grad school i think i maybe had teachers that i would really apply that label too out of the probably or professors i had i was merely qualifying my statement about attendance that while it will certainly raise the floor on your grades there will be classes that will certainly require more effort than that namely weeder classes particularly when the professor is a prick in that class managerial accounting and finance the ugrad prebusiness reqs that were the weeder classes at my school were like that and in particular the managerial accounting professor was a notorious prick dozens of complaints every semester but tenure bitches so to speak he was the only teacher that taught the class as well so the only way to avoid him was summer school though he taught that occasionally as well his class not only had a strict attendance policy but also had assigned seating in a person class beyond that he would routinely throw people out of class reassign seating the class had desksoutlets the rest were auditorium style and other quasipunitive punishment against students for things like browsing the internet on your laptop or if your cell phone beeped he directly threatened to send me to the dean for having solitaire open on my laptop once in writing so yea just showing up wasnt going to get it done in his class and him being a prick didnt make it any easier for what its worth despite the dust up i still pulled an a in that class one of the most proud of grades ive ever received meanwhile my roommate failed it three times and ended up having to switch his major out of the business school over it the overwhelming majority of my professors were excellent and generally had flexible enough attendance policies that few people ran a foul of them personally for all but or classes i had near perfect attendance i was cs before switching to mis and having already been programming and doing general it stuff since i was some of the low level courses didnt require a lot of my attention for as shocking as it was i could identify all the internal components of a computer and didnt really need to sit through that lecture im not categorically for or against attendance policies as long as its reasonable really the only time i even cared about the policy was in cases were the professors were really really bad not being a prick i mean their abilities as an educator or if the class was remedial in relation to my preexisting knowledge mis programs have a number of those due to the rather high number foreignborn professors no one like sitting there for an hour lecture and only understanding a handful of sentences and that they had to cover the spectrum of students some came in with very little computer knowledge some were already actively employed in the field
GetMotivated,removed,isnt the problem that you cant keep the same workout routine into your or and you just become really obese i know family members and celebrities that were super fit but in their older age are just pretty obeseand obesity heart disease is the reason for deathso i dunno

GetMotivated,removed,you can kill yourself and your family just so long as its very gradually
GetMotivated,removed,its interesting in this sub that theres always a chorus of people who readily offer up their contrarian musings or scenarios to diminish the message of the post and smugly declare this post is dumb because i cobbled a reason together where it doesnt applycant work maybe its not all that surprising in a sub where people come to getmotivated that there would be people who havent quite found the knack for it and still languish in how things cant work instead of how things can maybe i just dont get this sub i dunno
GetMotivated,removed,off the top of my head mayor bloomberg went on a crusade against large soft drinks and michelle obama has waged a campaign of dieting restrictions for cafeteria lunches one prominent mayor and the first ladys personal project is not exactly evidence of something being common in our political discussion what are the major presidential candidates stances on obesity this year in in what about at the state level what do your representatives think about your states obesity the rest of your comment is based on the fact that not everyone agrees on the source of the problem the impact of the problem and how to fix the problem and for the most part i agree with that statement but the statement is entirely irrelevant there does not need to be any consensus on any of those aspects for it to be talked about in the political realm a good portion of politicians do not believe guns are an issue or they global warming is an issue a good portion of our politicians do not believe illegal immigration is a large issue or that terrorism isnt as large of a problem as its made out to be some politicians believe globalism is awful while others believe its beneficial all of these are the most prominent issues in our political discussion and people dont agree on any of them they dont agree on them being problems they dont agree on where they come from or how to fix them all of the major candidates have had different ideas on all of these topics and yet the candidates are asked about this every week in interviews they make them the primary issues of their campaigns they are brought up in the debates etc the point being it doesnt stop them from talking about them you could make a similar comment regarding every other political issue there is im not going to argue the evidence of the obesity epidemic because i frankly dont care i was just playing devils advocate however i think most of your comment is fallacious if you want to argue that obesity isnt an issue thats cool but dont both try to push the idea that it is prominent in our political realm and that it shouldnt be for the aforementioned reasons
GetMotivated,removed,i feel were at a cultural divide and impass with this despite what tumblr thinks we all kinda know what healthy looks like we all want people to look like captain america or thor but most of us fall very very short the impass is that while working out and eating right is one of the most deterministic and selfcontrolcentered things a normal healthy adult can do the food industry and food culture make it very challenging to eat right cheap sugary foods are addictive and even doctors were wrong for decades and decades about saturated fat vs carbs misinformation is rampant often considered to be common knowledge and if youre busy going to work every day and shuttling kids everywhere protein macros are going to be the last thing on your mind a wellintentioned hardworking person will do the right things that his parents who were born in the food pyramid generation told him to do eat a lot of small meals of highenergy lowfat carbs to stoke the fires of metabolism and run on the treadmill for minutes a day three times a week most people cant even make themselves do that but those who do will see results that are only moderate at best so they dont end up looking like superman consider it impossible go full havenot and suddenly its considered douchey to talk about working out meanwhile workout people actually have a fairly good handle on this stuff they pass on the free donuts at work they bring in very strange things to eat at lunch and dont want to join you for a third beer they might even post workout pictures the same way you post pictures of your diy projects hard work turned into pride these peopletheyre not quite like you and me theyre kinda weird and if you talk to them they mention stuff i dont totally understand like ketosis and intermittent fasting they dont eat meals tea dessert like i did growing up these people are not like me but food food tastes good going out for pizza and beer two of the most unhealthy normal foods in a normal diet thats fun thats something i do with friends and we all love it right thats great dont rain on my parade with your kale salad dont tell me how many calories are in that pizza and dont tell me its almost impossible to jog it all off later i dont want to confront all of that because ive already decided that fitness is impossible for me its not because i dont know if i can do all those things but its because im afraid to fail ill deflect ill make jokes about how the last years of my life are the ones i dont want despite the impact its making on my children ill do anything to selfjustify my mediocrity suck my dick you fuckman i dont want to have to change
GetMotivated,removed,nope you just really arent funny or original there are plenty of shitheads like you in random threads you do it to be cool all the while looking like an asswipe take your shitty comments to the appropriate discussion sections and get a life while youre at it

GetMotivated,removed,why is it so difficult for you to understand youre sedentary you dont need the amount energy youre taking in lack of walking hasnt caused you to gain weight continuing to eat like how you did before having walking difficulties has caused the weight gain so adjust your caloric intake i highly doubt your consuming at your bmr or counting accurately otherwise you wouldnt gain weight particularly to the point of being overweight according to you its or nothing thats a ridiculous jump no middle number no r i never said that the weight has caused you pain and keeping you from walking i said that losing weight will ease some of the pain less weight to bear less pain its not brain science actually ive found a few articles that suggest obesity can increase the risk of ms theres also plenty of weight loss advice for people with ms not too different to standard weight loss advice you are indeed overweight by choice in other words your own actions but whatever make excuses convince yourself to give up and stay fat and in pain for all i care

GetMotivated,removed,its no surprise that someone i have tagged as a serial reposter is throwing up dog shit content its also no surprise it got upvoted because its reddit fuck you and fuck you reddit
GetMotivated,removed,youre a fucking idiot and no better than a christian saying if there werent laws in place and you couldnt get caught i bet most of you atheists would hair go around being greedy and killing whoever got in your way also you all murder baby fetuses youre ridiculous
GetMotivated,removed,philosophy is srs bussines guys omg
GetMotivated,removed,i dont see nazism there
GetMotivated,removed,i actually think they did a pretty good job on most of them in making them relateable and understandable to a lay personobviously if you try to summarize thousands of pages in a words you are going to be severely lacking this thread is full of pedantic neckbeards who love to prove their intelligence by pointing out others shortcomings i would love to see someone else provide more accurate yet similarly brief explanations of each philosophical school of thought as they relate to our daytoday motivations
GetMotivated,removed,schopenhauerism just fucking kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,no u
GetMotivated,removed,its not that theyre necessarily bad summaries it just seems idiotic to sum up entire fields of thought with a few words bits not very practical and seems a bit miss leading
GetMotivated,removed,the only asian one thats good is mohism what the fuck does ordinary mean the graphic has a family which is a little illuminating confucianism stresses filial piety respect for ones family but specifically it proposes i think relationships in society that should be treated in a specific way in short its completely ridiculous to try to summarize confucianism in a graphic like this confucianism has no thesis other than perhaps society has a certain structure to it respectfully adhere to this structure and the legalism one is just plain wrong it is a philosophy on human nature that was applied in government its premise is that humans are naturally amoral and self serving they want goods but they avoid bads so an effective government punishes crime heavily to incentivize its citizens to follow the law nowhere is there a notion of learning practical things if legalism had a message on how to live life itd be follow the law even if you dont want to because otherwise youll eat shit also its fucking preposterous to group those schools of thought off as asian they are major philosophical schools of thought that developed around the same time in china hilariously enough buddhism and daoism are much better suited at explaining how one should live life and theres myriad other asian philosophies that are looked over here tldr dis graphic dumb at yo
GetMotivated,removed,heres a better discussion

GetMotivated,removed,i dont have any summaries or shitty clipart representations of those summaries so id rather just not post ridiculous bullshit on the internet if youre interested in philosophy go study it and never ever try to summarize or diminish it
GetMotivated,removed,they missed nonesensism trumps school of thought
GetMotivated,removed,cynicism publicly urinate and search for honest men
GetMotivated,removed,does logical positivism even belong on this chart at all its a philosophical position about what it means for scientific statements to have meaning not for life to have meaning the closest thing i could imagine for a logical positivist position on the meaning of life would be something like no assertion about what the meaning of life might be should be taken seriously unless it could be meaningfully tested otherwise statements about what the meaning of life is are themselves meaningless also the summary you gave it i think would fit better with existentialism than the summary currently applied to existentialism
GetMotivated,removed,hours and no one has replied rip this thread
GetMotivated,removed,i dont see any philosophers here except plato what a shitty fucking image
GetMotivated,removed,nominee for passive aggressive awards
GetMotivated,removed,when i was it was easier to get my hands on pot than on booze as a finn i find this really really hard to believe is it true in australia or anywhere because in finland its literally more socially acceptable to drink vodka underage until you puke in the town square fountain and pass out than admit youve ever used any drugs all drugs are equally weird no matter if its weed morphine or lsd in many teenager groups
GetMotivated,removed,besides being a bunch of shittyinnaccurate summations why would this motivate anyone why does this have so many upvotes is this sub getting rfunny disease where it honestly doesnt matter what gets posted so long as it can be easily digested
GetMotivated,removed,fair enough i just dont feel like typing this convo on a trollinfested reddit drinking at a bar and discussing this im down for any day
GetMotivated,removed,no such thing as the friendzone what was this written by a feminist or some sjw
GetMotivated,removed,youre a real piece of shit dude
GetMotivated,removed,i mean life doesnt always resolve either
GetMotivated,removed,i mean some drugs are just to stabalise someone for long enough that they can try and get help before they kill themselves but i agree that in a lot of cases people use it as a crutch to avoid dealing with the actual issue i wouldnt ban them all though thats for sure
GetMotivated,removed,yeah but so do women and thats just called sexism or gender roles because describing it as toxic femininity would be putting an unnecessary negative connotation on all things feminine people would be outraged if a group got together and tried to argue that certain negative traits are intrinsically femalecertain female traits are intrinsically negative yet toxic masculinity is doing just that but with male traits that being said im not gonna be pedantic and slam the comic just because it used a phrase i dont like the author writer artist of this comic did a pretty good job of describing a lot of things that young people go through it was funny too my favourite part was the guy whos a fucking kangaroo for some reason if its an ongoing webcomic then this guy just got a new fan
GetMotivated,removed,just that certain elements of masculinity are harmful to the wellbeing of men and others i knew that thats why i said people would be outraged if a group got together and tried to argue that certain negative traits are intrinsically femalecertain female traits are intrinsically negative
GetMotivated,removed,the guys brother just died acting like its no big deal is indeed something a toxic person would do also he seems to be criticizing australian culture in general which takes this tough guy attitude and dials it up to

GetMotivated,removed,hate to stalk you there but you didnt respond to my other comment you just kinda downvoted it and ignored it which is a shame because you seem very interested in talking about toxic masculinity to people so i wanted to get your view on a few things main one being that if toxic masculinity is such a controversial term why do we have to use it when we could just say gender roles or sexism and put across the same point without causing a flame war
GetMotivated,removed,i dont like the idea of masculinity by itself as a concept either like a bunch of standards and benchmarks for whether i am a man fuck off sometimes i feel like wearing a dress for no reason other than to spite people who feel like i shouldnt because of my genitals anyway thx for sharing mate i recognize a lot of your issues i had as well i caught my lack of moderation in alcohol consumption relatively early after i started drinking and never did anything dumber than puke in inappropriate places and get a little aggressiverude with strangers just sharing your experiences is good for men and boys because we lack that culture of sharing and empathizing with each other
GetMotivated,removed,i agree with you and all that i hope thats what it sounds like im saying if someone didnt know they had to talk to people like theyre human beings and like they wanted to know them then they should keep it up because for them to not do that in the first place is rare it means thats just naturally who they are they should stick with it so that maybe they will get lucky and find someone theyre compatible with and for the majority of cases everyone attracted to someone attempts to treats them like human and acts interested in getting to know them its just a given and part of what naturally happens when you like someone which leads me to my conclusion that most guys really get their girlfriends just by being nice naturally showing their body language and being attractive its the same stuff the nice guys try to do and it only fails if the other girl isnt attracted to them not because theyve missed an important step dats my point
GetMotivated,removed,funny how pot is just a natural plant with no known harmful effects and yet most people couldnt have access to it forever alcohol is well known for many many harmful short and long term effects and its ingrained into our culture because its a process private companies can make a profit on where anyone can grow weed so ban it and keep the wealth flowing in specific patterns
GetMotivated,removed,the whole thing was about him being accountable and self aware he never blamed society for his problems youre full of shit
GetMotivated,removed,hi gruntpizzaparty theres some ongoing discussion below about what now so lets talk about it some of the commenter here dont seem to understand the correlation between using drinking as a social crutch and being a nice guy well in both circumstances youre using something outside yourself to gain self confidence and social armor so how do we solve that root problem how does mr gruntpizzaparty or any other nice guy stop needing social armor andor get social armor hobbies specifically hobbies that make you feel good possibly also hobbies that involve a mixed gender ratio realize women often dont participate in open gaminganimeboarg games groups because the prevalence of nice guys makes it unbearable i am one of those women we have a women and lgbt and poc and allyonly group because we all went to the main one and were harassed anyway go out of your comfort zone physically and join a preferably physical group hobby if you need to train first do it set a deadline just stop yourself from attempting to woo any woman for a while or getting angry if she engages with a more confident male try really really hard to imagine everyone has a penis just be a good friend but not a sycophantic nice guy friend an actual one dont buy gifts dont give compliments about appearance once you gain some confidence maybe consult a hair dresser or dept store about your appearance just make sure youre bring yoir best you then if you want to ask a girl out be direct and confident do you want to get dinner some time if she immediately tries to make it a group thing go along with it shes either letting you down easy or is also awkward and wants some help be prepared for rejection it happens to everyone im a lady and it happened to me last night just do not be nice and have an expectation that the other person owes you anything besides reciprocal niceness you open the door they say thank you not you compliment them constantly they fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,i agree
GetMotivated,removed,i can put up with bitching as long as she is hot and most men without options tend to do the same
GetMotivated,removed,its not about expectations its not that complex of a term but people are making it out to be in the past few years it seems like the idea of a friend zone became taboo when i first heard of the term it meant nothing more than a person who you would not have a physicalromantic relationship with you meet a girl you like her and yall get along and remain friends but shes not interested youre in the friend zone you cant date her because she has come to look at you as a friend and in most cases thats not going to change it seems like people just like to use this term these days as a way of shitting over guys who are often young socially inept to some degree and dont have it figured out yet that nice doesnt automatically equal attractive the friend zone doesnt exist youre not really a nice guy youre actually a piece of shit who thinks a girl owes you sex because you held the door open for her it should be more like hey buddy that girl youve been hanging out with for the past month hasnt even given you a hug yet youre probably in the friend zone time to look elsewhere
GetMotivated,removed,with all the neckbeards on reddit this probably hits close to home for pretty much all of them you could easily have a profitable audience for this comic on reddit and probably also on on though they might be a bit more cynical about it
GetMotivated,removed,it seems to me that your fucked up ex desired that whole life of independence and painting but really couldnt move past her insecurities and comfort zone to make it happen so when you decided you wanted to move forward with your life which would help her move forward with hers she decided to stay in her comfort zone and stay dependent on someone else to take care of her who happened to be your shithead of a friend that guy is just a grade a piece of garbage anyways just trying to figure out what was going through her mind its really shitty how that situation went i dont think theres anything you couldve done differently aside from throwing your life away it was never going to work in the end im sorry you had to go through that you have a beautiful way of portaying feelings and experiences in a deeply personal way through your comics thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,removed,or a circle jerk either way i get off
GetMotivated,removed,ummm that reality is missing some sharknados with lasers or at least a few trolls trying to pull you down along the way

GetMotivated,removed,sounds like im about to be sent to fucking narnia
GetMotivated,removed,i forget where i saw it probably on this sub but a quote said something along the lines of dont say you dont have time for something say its not part of your priorities by saying its not part of your priorities it puts the whole situation in a new light you can then appraise if you have your desired priorities in order i dont suggest losing sleep though because thats a slippery slope lol ive pulled way too many all nighters in my life and theyve cost me a lot more than i thought they would

GetMotivated,removed,oh my god am i tired of unsolicited advice you dont know anything about me you dont know what im doing about it i never said im depressed and theres nothing i can do about it but thanks for your unwanted input and terrible advice ill keep it in my back pocket for when i blow my brains out
GetMotivated,removed,whenever i need some good demotivation i read the comments in rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,theres a relevant ejaculation comment in here somewhere
GetMotivated,removed,then your hair gets tangled to shit
GetMotivated,removed,agree it is incredibly patronizing major depression does not work like this
GetMotivated,removed,actually they change to gotta be careful what hoods you walk around in wearing that yellow though dem be the banana boys colors
GetMotivated,removed,dont worry the comment section of getmotivated is full of crying people
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think you understand the definition of irony
GetMotivated,removed,they both look cold what is this shit
GetMotivated,removed,k guys lets pack it up we solved depression
GetMotivated,removed,thank you this is something i truly believe with all my heart but catch a lot of flak for saying ive battled with severe depression and anxiety my entire life and i came very close to losing that battle i eventually left high school to seek treatment and over the next two years i eventually saw how much powerful it is to change your mindset even a little when i was at my lowest point of depression trying to die and putting no effort into living i didnt think i had any power over what was happening to me it felt down right insulting when someone claimed that thoughts and feelings could do anything for this chemical imbalance that was killing me i obviously cant explain those years in just a reddit comment but my thinking did a complete no one makes me mad no one makes me sad no one annoys me and no one makes me happy i make myself mad i make myself sad and i make myself happy based on how i choose to react to my situation but is this belief of mine a universal truth of course not in fact its not even entirely true for me sometimes i really cant do anything about the chemical imbalance this permanent corruption that lives in the back on my head but having the attitude that i can is almost just as good and that is what has brought me as far as i am is my depression gone no and it never will be even now i have days where i just want to stop everything but happiness is a bit like glass it can be hard to see even if its in front of your face but if you change your perspective just a little it will shine brilliantly but depression is a fortress of solitude that blocks out all the light even still changing my perspective has been enough to crack the walls and let the sun shine through
GetMotivated,removed,when i stand into the wind i get dust in my eyes
GetMotivated,removed,the girl in yellow will soon have dust in her eyes
GetMotivated,removed,she looks like a snooty bitch
GetMotivated,removed,yes but there are people in situations they cant get out of the picture says the only difference is which way you look thats ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,please dont these stupid pictures do not help people with depression its more like a punch to the face when you see this i assume your just being a sarcastic troll tho
GetMotivated,removed,correct its from the most recent jackass movie
GetMotivated,removed,yeah a picture is going to correct her neurotransmitter imbalance i hope youre trolling
GetMotivated,removed,s to the p to the aghetti spaghetti
GetMotivated,removed,this is very patronizing
GetMotivated,removed,interesting points but ultimately incorrect you see this iama gave rapists a socially accepted place to boast about their achievements some of the posts were detailed enough that it was almost an instruction manual on how not to get caught and people were justifying their actions or saying it wasnt really rape or thanking them for sharing their stories you operate in the assumption that if someone wants to rape someone they will this is incorrect there are many people out there who want to rape someone want to molest children want to rape animals or other sexually deviant and abhorrent activities but the fear of getting caught and social unacceptance stops many of them from acting on it its shitty that thats all it is but it is this thread may very well have given people the methods and social justification and acceptance to act on desires they havent so while i agree that it provided an insight into a side of humanity i dont understand i also think it had the potential to be incredibly dangerous
GetMotivated,removed,if you ever find yourself somewhere in life that is so low deep dark and depressing that you look up and lose all hope of ever climbing out of your hole of sadness but you then find some semblance of solace in anything ever said or muttered by leslie jones you my friend are as desparate and deluded as a jewish man dieing in a desert from thirst willing to suck the dick of reincarnated hitler to find a moment of respite from the thirst hoping for nothing more than that sweet release into your mouth
GetMotivated,removed,which is too bad because it removes all the joy i got from seeing that douchebag get piss on himself always hated bam because he could dish it out but not take it hed do horrible pranks to people and theyd all laugh anyone does something to him and he turns into year old throwing a tantrum dico all the way
GetMotivated,removed,because its ignorant and wrong

GetMotivated,removed,jim carrey is awesome and he is one of the few comedians who can make me laugh out loud
GetMotivated,removed,he can fucking blow me antivax overrated trash i would say it to his face too
GetMotivated,removed,bullshit if that speech came out of the lips of someone you didnt like or an objectively awful person then of course the individual is a part of how its interpreted jim carrey is a cunt think what you like his reprehensible actions and completely horrid logic absolutely effects how i hear his message
GetMotivated,removed,how about thousands of people on earth dont fucking kill temselves or get fucking depressed coz of jim carreys movies go fuck yourself on behalf of jim carrey
GetMotivated,removed,any advice on motivating yourself to achieve personal goals outside of work do you actually have personal goals from the way you said things im not sure if you havent achieved goals because you dont have them or because you just havent been able to pull them off if you dont have goals the first step is to set some check out httpswwwredditcomrgetmotivatedwiki for some worksheets or how to get over a silly fear that you cant learn something new or pick up a new skilltalenthobby read mindset by carol dweck
GetMotivated,removed,when youre listened to when you have a platform that can effect others on an important in this case one that literally means life or death you do your homework before spouting whatever nonsense pops into your head people listened to him and others like him and their children are dead thats the point he couldve retracted what he said or taken responsibility for the things he says antivaccination pseudoscience was outlawed in my country where the doctor who first made these claims was stripped of all licences as it was immediately obvious his lies were to profit from pharmaceutical companies and poor uneducated people whos child died this is more than idiocy and its really a disgusting act on his part its not something we should ignore and yes it does make him a piece of shit between and there were nearly preventable deaths children and over preventable illnesses destroying quality of life for children and their families cause by not vaccinating children no autism carrey had no place to be campaigning for this absolute disgusting bullshit and he has had ample opportunity to set the record straight i find that abhorrent this is not somebody i or anyone else should be listening to for advice
GetMotivated,removed,heaven forbid poor white people in the rust belt vote like a minority group
GetMotivated,removed,fuck u

GetMotivated,removed,how about you fuck off and see that its about hard work and now how inspiring a story is
GetMotivated,removed,shout out to rthedonald
GetMotivated,removed,stupid people
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,this sub gets worse and worse
GetMotivated,removed,is the gesture a reference to
GetMotivated,removed,dats racist
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,i am groot fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,too long didnt read dont care
GetMotivated,removed,you could ask that about most of the shit posted on this sub for a while now i wish i could be so easily motivated
GetMotivated,removed,i dont know why but this post finally made me unsubscribe from this sub
GetMotivated,removed,do people on this sub actually get motivated by this kind of stuff its like a subreddit for different variations of the hang in there kitten
GetMotivated,removed,til hitler planted jews
GetMotivated,removed,if only they made you develop a personality i will find a way to win this passive aggressive war ive started just you wait ill use memes if i have too
GetMotivated,removed,these quotes are so blatantly ignorant about psychology its almost astonishing nobody ever chooses to be happy or miserable normal people dont have that kind of control over their feelings
GetMotivated,removed,or we make ourselves money by writing bullshit books for ignorant idiots
GetMotivated,removed,i am both miserable and strong i have mental disorders such that if i dont work out and stay driven in certain areas of my life they are ten times worse but i hate it its like someone running behind you with a knife at kmhr you gotta run forever also it is easy to be miserable billions of people on this planet are miserable through no fault of their own and no effort simply luck of the draw in where and how they were born i hate quotes like these entitled bs quotes why am i even on this sub haha unsubscribe
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,i saw this thread when it hit rall and most of the top comments disagreed with the quote now hours later they have been removed this post has motivated me motivated me to block this sub on my mobile app
GetMotivated,removed,youre free to try and reconcile beliefs like slavery ethnic prejudice sexism sexual oppression and but you then forfeit that an individual has no sovereignty and if an individual has no sovereignty then a middle ground is null and void because polarized views have no sovereignty to weigh against each other you can have it both ways middle ground rhetoric is simply cowardice in the guise of acceptance
GetMotivated,removed,but you cant believe in middle grounds and denounce extremists in the same worldview either through reconciliation or disagreement you have to agree that the end result is that not all beliefs have value as you must disregard the sovereignty of the people who have those beliefs if not all beliefs have value then what middle ground can you possibly take its cowardice a means of avoiding justification for your value system
GetMotivated,removed,dont apologize this sub is filled with people who are experts at finding reasons to not be motivated the irony is painful
GetMotivated,removed,lost lbs in the past year and withoit a doubt being fat sad and lazy was actually much harder than eating well going to the gym and taking care of myself the mental fatigue of believing youre destined to die a miserable piece of shit is taxing
GetMotivated,removed,goes in ring and gets knocked the fuck out possible brain damage physiologically impossible to get up ali man thats wrong kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,a lot of the negative nancies are beyond saving anyway

GetMotivated,removed,ali was super racists can we not glorify a racist please
GetMotivated,removed,he was a fervent racist sorry
GetMotivated,removed,im tired of people glorifying racists racism is never cool including when its towards whites
GetMotivated,removed,this is especially true for things that might be really difficult getting sacked or dumped do it with pride be the bigger person and dont burn those bridges they might come in useful at some point and if anyone disagrees with me then fuck you ive been kicked out sacked and dumped in the last hours so this is the one thing ive got
GetMotivated,removed,what the fuck man kys
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,whites have the entire world catering to their race yet still manage to be insecure and racist af so pathetic
GetMotivated,removed,i read online that every pounds you lose you grow an inch on your penis is that true
GetMotivated,removed,maybe get a tattoo of the fat ass you on your back like get it real professionally done
GetMotivated,removed,i heard that one a few times actually the thing is when you are depressed enough to want to kill yourself you are not in the mood for travelling exploring and all that you cant get out of your damn bed half of the time let alone do the grocery so sailing around the world is out of the question
GetMotivated,removed,wow you learned to play the guitar in years because of this sub thats amazing congrats
GetMotivated,removed,holy shit dude great work dont listen to any trolls on here theyre probably just mad they went from the right pic to the left
GetMotivated,removed,i measured the difference in distance between your ears between the photos the head heights are about the same but your skull has been clearing been shrinking est in width over the years id be speaking to a doctor

GetMotivated,removed,oh shit whaddup tyler
GetMotivated,removed,i dont understand the connection with gun laws and criminals honestly you can get guns without going through the legal ways especially if someone is so committed to it so how does banning guns help anyone
GetMotivated,removed,so my calorie intake of was causing me to gain weight and you know more than my urologist interesting
GetMotivated,removed,i would gold you if i wasnt broke as fuck close enough my first gold whooo d ignorance is bliss on the other hand steven hawking had children even though doctors had told him he wouldnt live another two years he was either egoistic or extremely delusional to think thats a good idea there are plenty of intelligent people who still fall for delusional ideas compassion weighs more than whatever level of intelligence one has in my book the human race is doomed to fail most people dont seem to understand that something like the heat death of the universe isnt unlikely to occur before that we may witness a climaterelated catastrophe and yet some act as if humans will live happily ever after but suicide will never be accepted in society as long as religion are present religion is part of the problem interestingly though there are religious ideas that i like classic buddhism regards everything in life as suffering and seeks to end the cycle of birth and death even some parts of the bible criticize childbearing and i declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are still alive but better than both is the one who has never been born who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun ecclesiastes the httpsenwikipediaorgwikishakers were a christian sect that opposed having children by the way i can really recommend the books mentioned in on rantinatalism the one mentioned in the op and the three mentioned in the top comment and arthur schopenhauer is the realest author out there the world as will and representation is the best book ive ever read every cradle is a grave is about suicide specifically its the best approach on the subject i know
GetMotivated,removed,start enjoying time alone fuck you ya piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,this makes perfect rational sense but the positive feedback loop tends to spiral the other way for me meh this crockpot is a little crusty better soak it in hot water for a little while oh wow every other dish fits so nicely in this pot lets just soak em all and absolutely tee off on crustfree dishes later roommate adds one plate well fuck this ungrateful motherfucker how was that casserole bet it was unfuckingbelievable since it was slowcooked for hours you know what think ill just leave all this shit right here until he realizes that my passive aggressive move can only end with him cleaning or both of us starving
GetMotivated,removed,commit suicide
GetMotivated,removed,get the fuck off off of
GetMotivated,removed,oh fuck off and quit trying to tell me what to do with your stupid quotes sss
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,youre the worst kind of pedant someone who takes a sentence of obvious meaning and picks it apart as false due to meaningless inaccuracy could the lions kill a hippo yes how by harassing it to exhaustion would that require sprinting no is a lion likely to harass a hippo for days no but they could if exigencies required it and in any event it could likely be accomplished in hours not days
GetMotivated,removed,ah gotcha so kinda synonymous to neckbeard but more focused on dragon ball z
GetMotivated,removed,this guy dies
GetMotivated,removed,a lion will have a hard time killing an adult unarmed man and if you add a knife to the equation id put my money on the man cant tell if srs
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is a fucking joke
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,dr suesses real wife also killed herself because he loved another woman and cheated on her
GetMotivated,removed,kill yourself you didnt say what to motivate
GetMotivated,removed,right but if i have to whip out a fucking dictionary to understand the meaning of his comment is it really worth it not everyone on reddit knows english as a first language
GetMotivated,removed,hey ukdawgca this is now the top post on reddit it will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts
GetMotivated,removed,its uplifting until you realize he was the world to his wife who
GetMotivated,removed,i really like this sentiment but then
GetMotivated,removed,ironic coming from a man who abandoned his wife when she had terminal cancer found another lover and drove his wife to commit suicide from depression
GetMotivated,removed,to the world you may be a piece of shit but to a piece of shit youre an asshole esckeyartist
GetMotivated,removed,what the fuck ted helen probably
GetMotivated,removed,dr seuss was a racist and he made money off his racism for many years hes a fucking hack
GetMotivated,removed,to be frank probabaly because you sound like an ass also omg look how eloquently i constructed these sentences generally doesnt make you seem smarter
GetMotivated,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you if this black and white bullshit quote is changing your life
GetMotivated,removed,youre absolutely right we gotta ban motivational quotes or at least have backround checks and waiting periods but definitely no high capacity posts with quotes in them
GetMotivated,removed,adderall get on it
GetMotivated,removed,i guess this is a proper rebuttal to someone who quotes ops proverb to me in a passive aggressive critical way

GetMotivated,removed,i will probably get downvoted for what i am about to say i am very happy for him to have found something to do to make him also happy but in his condition i dont think his worrying about bills credits and other stuff that normal people are i mean most of us dont even have time to have a decent breakfast let along having time to go to the gym and get striped we all could find maybe a few hours a day to spare for gym but then what you have to sacrifice that in order to spend time with family or enjoying a tv show or a nice pc game sorry all if i was a fucking piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,i dont really care i get downvoted a lot and am banned from a bunch of subreddits i think its important to speak your mind do i respect the hell out of this guy fuck yeah he reminds me of the body builder with one leg you cant possibly say no one should find this at least a little funny though

GetMotivated,removed,answered you on the other comment dont worry i wont forget about you stalker bro what im trying to get at is it doesnt matter why i find it funny because humor is subjective so youll undoubtedly say but that isnt funny to my response no matter what it is its not a conversation worth having

GetMotivated,removed,love how toxic every single comment thread is on this sub youd think this would be a positive place to be around instead we have nothing but negativity flowing go ahead and dissect everything
GetMotivated,removed,when i see things like this i defer to quite possibly the most inappropriate mantra someone could take on but i love it
GetMotivated,removed,i think youd be surprised by how deep seated the connection is between discomfort surprise and laughter i think the most poignant passage ive found even though it comes from fiction is this i had thought – i had been told – that a funny thing is a thing of a goodness it isnt not ever is it funny to the person it happens to like that sheriff without his pants the goodness is in the laughing itself i grok it is a bravery and a sharing against pain and sorrow and defeat stranger in a strange land even jokes without a clear butt make use of misunderstanding looking at laugher this way makes it clear why people would share in the humor of this guy with palsy it is both uncomfortably sad and tremendously motiving to see this man overcome his illness in such a terrific way now you can be a dick about shaming him or belittling him but a laugh for its own sake shouldnt be judged unless you fully grok the motivation
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you god i will not quit this is the most awesome thing i have seen in a while im choked up
GetMotivated,removed,this reminded me of a post i saw a couple days back about one of the best doctor who scenes in the comments there was a quote that i had forgotten about where the doctor saysi wouldnt say that the way i see it every life is a pile of good things and bad things the good things dont always soften the bad things but viceversa the bad things dont necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant and we definitely added to his pile of good things this is the post

GetMotivated,removed,when i was years old my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life when i went to school they asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up i wrote down happy they told me i didnt understand the assignment and i told them they didnt understand life then i called miss nikki a dirty cunt and got kicked out of school today i write to you a happy man

GetMotivated,removed,hi heres a summary of what an ad hominem is httprationalwikiorgwikiargumentumadhominem from the latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself the fallacy is a subset of the httprationalwikiorgwikigeneticfallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument an ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument
GetMotivated,removed,that porsche is so lame
GetMotivated,removed,i hate this quote its worded in a way that says who gives a fck if you screw over or stab someone in the back on the way to success its going to happen if you want it when in reality that isnt true at all why yes i agree you cant please everyone but that doesnt mean you have to hurt them not pleasing can include not screwing over or having a neutralnot negative impact on others
GetMotivated,removed,words on an illegally parked porsche im pumped for success
GetMotivated,removed,why is this first page no upvotes no comments i dont get it

GetMotivated,removed,itt people butthurt over joseph stalin saying a motivational quote
GetMotivated,removed,gary vaynerchuk has the distinction of being one of the most irritating men ive ever met combine the most negative characteristics of silicon valley tech bro soooo selfassured his way is the way particularly in new techniques that have zero quant backup the voracious greed and blind elitism of high finance consultants use of buzzwords obfuscation misdirection and sketchy data when he wants to sound smart life coaches aggressive and unrealistic optimism quirkiness and guarantee of success when he wants to sound inspiring vague rambling filler words logical circles and unclear messaging of millennials when he wants to sound relatable just throwing out unnecessary information and listing words numbers ages and ideas when he wants to sounds robust ive never pitched him or worked with him i attended a roundtable where he unable to answer any specific questions highlevel or granular but was really effective at telling us were losers which is hilarious because after he left he was dubbed the httpsenwikipediaorgwikipatricewilson of marketing just with a loooot more coke
GetMotivated,removed,its mostly the left that worships mass murdering communists so this doesnt really make sense
GetMotivated,removed,i hope whoever posted this is a troll otherwise you are just fucking sick
GetMotivated,removed,its not like anyone takes this sub seriously at least this post is meta and realizes what a joke this place is
GetMotivated,removed,are you a russian troll stalin is responsible for starving between million ukranians not to mention the political purges of countless thousands my grandfathers parents were killed and he spent his childhood in a children of the enemy camp my grandmas friends and family were dying in their sleep from starvation stalin is arguably worse than hitler you uneducated moron
GetMotivated,removed,yeah no this is bs this is how you get passed up for promotions and better positions this is the crap you hear a year old say who has zero life experience if you are going above and beyond make sure the right people know if you dont some idiot who hardly does anything but can kiss ass is going to end up better off then you i swear this sub is full of the worst advice ever
GetMotivated,removed,this passive aggressive crap is why youll never get promoted kill it be an asset let everyone know in a non dickish way profit
GetMotivated,removed,youre a fucking moron
GetMotivated,removed,capitalism and america alone has killed billions more people than blatant lies and dubious statistics about communism have ever claimed to pull
GetMotivated,removed,its a joke who cares if its offensive you choose to be offended you can either choose to laugh or you can choose to be offended why the fuck do you choose to be offended
GetMotivated,removed,i love when rich capitalists say make time for your passion forgetting that theres people struggling to make ends meet and cant get ahead in life without becoming a prick back stabbing left and right or taking a gamble with student loans and workingstudying themselves to death
GetMotivated,removed,does it matter who said it i saw three front page posts with the same quote but different themes the porsche theme the cosby edition and the stallin one if this sub has succeeded in one thing motivating me to look for better serving motivational sources thanks

GetMotivated,removed,i know this is getmotivated but guyslets make this all about milo and sjws ok
GetMotivated,removed,that doesnt means ban milo he hated the movie he had every right to say he thought i sucked in america you dont blame people for what other people do
GetMotivated,removed,lol did you miss how she said she was crying because someone in twitter said they didnt lie her movie and only calmed down after that person was banned
GetMotivated,removed,coordinated racist abuse oh you mean like banning a white man from twitter because he said he didnt like a movie while blm activists make tweet after tweet about killing the police and donald trump or does that not count because hundreds of years ago white people milo isnt even related to had slaves
GetMotivated,removed,from his tweet fat and ugly ugly ugly fat i dont think you know what constructive means also at least the new gostbusters has a hot black guy in it not racisst thats right but still an asshole
GetMotivated,removed,rape it is
GetMotivated,removed,so does this mean she needs to get fired for the disaster remake of ghostbusters shes not someone who i would take advice from especially when she threw a tantrum on twitter and begged for people to get banned because she cant take a troll
GetMotivated,removed,and remember kids if you want to grow up and be in a terrible movie and then cry about it when someone criticizes it you can do that too
GetMotivated,removed,freemilo

GetMotivated,removed,last year less than people died in the us from gunshot wounds and of them were suicides more people are killed by blunt and edged weapons here than by guns but the media and government pretend like guns are the source of all violence because banning citizens from having them makes things safer for politicians who dont listen to the people its always been about protecting their own asses not making the neighborhoods of common people safer
GetMotivated,removed,ok arnorath youre destined to be mediocre in life and if you make it its only because of luck and if you didnt make it by now you might as well deal with the shitty life you have hows that for motivation is that more to your tune

GetMotivated,removed,at least you got those pain pills
GetMotivated,removed,haha have you been living under a rock look at rightwing media and the legions of rightwingers who comment in support of it ive debated countless rightwingers and a considerable segment of them would use the above information to throw hate at mr rogers
GetMotivated,removed,you are using the term pedophile when you should be using child rapistmolester you can choose not to be a child molester or rapist but nobody chooses to be attracted to children you cant choose your sexual preference but you can decide not to act on it
GetMotivated,removed,russell brand apparently never heard of social anxiety disorder try yelling a person with turrets to stop yelling fuck twat you fuck twat
GetMotivated,removed,alright but the point was that the first commenter said that words cant magically change your perspective like snapping your fingers which is untrue i dont go around in my day to day life bashing child molesters pedophiles i was just telling an anecdote about how i was feeling bad one day and then that one thought flipped a switch
GetMotivated,removed,i reckon that there are at least quite a few deluded individuals that wake up as youve described as it has been a rather ubiquitous problem among humanity as a whole
GetMotivated,removed,i was reading this at work and my boss came to ask me why i was on reddit at work fuck you russell brand
GetMotivated,removed,i hate this sub honestly its so full of sportswear sales slogans that it makes me throw up in my mouth a little every time i see a post but ima help you out one of the most brilliant pieces of philosophy ive ever heard came from a german who said when a man has destroyed his reputation he can finally begin to live roll that around in your head bucket for a minute and see what it does for you ive since forgotten the germans name although i could get it quickly through a bourdain research but i can assure you he probably knew where the nearest fisting piss orgy was
GetMotivated,removed,thank you airwick marketing person who clearly bought an aged account so the post doesnt look as fake for the helpful advice ps if your buying an account that endorses a family product do you really want to use one with that links to
GetMotivated,removed,hell yeah it is its an aged account with a lot of activity the theory being it looks a lot less fake at least to the algorithms the problem with buying old accounts is they have comments on them and some times there not brand appropriate for example they bought an account that links to a porn video called
GetMotivated,removed,when im feeling really shitty about my situation i tend to judge people more day to day ill notice ridiculous pants maybe if someone trips and what someone im with is eating but im not going to be an asshole about any of their choices unless the person in question has already done something which makes me think that they might be a prick when im feeling healthier and like i have a goal in my life and like im going somewhere i like to be very tolerant in my judgements of others if not just totally wrapped up in my own plans and life and not even noticing the details of other peoples lives very much at all just my two cents
GetMotivated,removed,if you care that much about what they think on the first few dates you probably wont get very far my friend they can sense desperation and neediness a mile away just be yourself get out of your head and hope they like you for the person you are not the person you think they want you to be thats how you date correctly imo unless youre just a piece of shit in which case yeah maybe lying is a better option
GetMotivated,removed,im not going to change my post to serve a troll im a dude in denver just trying to help some people out gl thinking what you want to think anyone who views this as a marketing ploy for airwick is insane thanks for the feedback buddy
GetMotivated,removed,weirdly enough going through a breakup flipped a switch in my head to start cleaning daily and keeping it that way feeling like youre a piece of shit and being tired of feeling that way can be a motivator
GetMotivated,removed,i dont normally scroll through peoples history but i needed to prove the point didnt have to go back more than hours to find a post where you are mentioning the votes made to your post x of redditors care about karma and care about it and are liars

GetMotivated,removed,the catholic church is a particularly good hiding place for a pedophile youre by default considered a pillar of the community someone who would require a considerable mountain of evidence against before they were accused of a crime there is nobody raising an eyebrow about you not being married and people will willingly send their kids to spend oneonone time with you even if the kids say they dont like it plus theres usually a shortage of catholic priests so that compounds the reluctance of the church to kick you out
GetMotivated,removed,i understand your point however there really isnt much of a discussion youre setting out here aside from go create a lasting dynasty of whateverthefuck to get your shining moment of glory honestly bro some people have bigger shit to deal with than just playing video games all day it isnt easy to just go ahead and fix shit in your real life some people deal with illnesses physical and mental some people deal with crippling poverty and being born into unfortunate circumstances some people are born into wealth and wellconnected families that allow them to cruise through life on easymode the only thing ive ever learned about trying to become great was that once you start comparing yourself to those people in the history books you start to feel like shit and insignificant everyone is different and everyone deals with their own inner demons i got bigger fish to fry than trying to get my face on tv or come up with some wonderful invention thatll change lives and if that ever happens itll happen naturally through hard work and dedication do i want to deal with that hard work and dedication fuck no im perfectly content with working parttime while being a student studying what i love and doing my best to network as long as im not an asshole to the people i love and care about theyll forever remember me as me and thats perfectly fine i do agree with your point on smartphones though social media has become a huge market that it affects everything within our lives unless youre flexing hard about your new job or new clothes or whateverthefuck you want to unnecessarily brag about i dont see a point at all in social media unless its to keep in touch with people
GetMotivated,removed,your moms an expert bitch
GetMotivated,removed,this is the dumbest shit i think ive ever read do what people who win do yeah exactly let me just pull out the great big book of how to win at life and magically get all my shit together i tried to have an actual discussion with you and youve summarized yourself into being a fucking dick so kudos to you for doing absolutely nothing to motivate anybody on here im certain ive done a lot more than you have both artistically and professionally and im only so i have literally nothing to say to you anymore except that youre complaining about being downvoted for being an idiot maybe if you posted something worthwhile and didnt just tell people to get shit done instead of explaining any processes or how or why these people were successful instead of just saying because they spent lesstime on the internet you probably wouldnt get downvoted or crying about all these trolls that are out to get you perspective yeah try getting your head out of your ass and you might just realize how to start winning at life yourself because im certain now that youve got absolutely nothing to be proud of nor a legacy worth sharing you sound like a bitter man who got fucked over by someone and cant get over it success is subjective whatever makes people happy makes them happy i bet youre real fun at parties oh wait you dont give a shit about family or friends so you dont get invited to those nevermind
GetMotivated,removed,youre genuinely telling me that i need to contribute even more to society besides handling a fulltime course load and working hours a week sorry bud this is my fucking gameplan and i still have time to hit the gym and be productive exactly how i want to be productive you are so inconsiderate and obviously harboring negativity maybe even jealousy at all these important people that youre convinced you want to be like them too which is fine except that i already know who you consider to be important and that doesnt fit with my definition so lets agree to disagree and because this is reddit im gonna call you a fucking idiot and move on with my life
GetMotivated,removed,wow a reply phenomenal would read again continue being edgy bro lets see how great your heights become in years from now when youre still ranting online about trying to be someone important
GetMotivated,removed,about as subjective as i think your opinion isnt important at all im sitting here thinking the exact same thing about you that you wont become someone great either whats your point again
GetMotivated,removed,right and how do you about keeping a roof over your head transportation food utilities and the other things that one needs i guess join welfare and go hiking every day i mean thats the only thing youd be able to afford doing so yeah nobody wants to work but we all live in the real world just get a hobby you like do it as often as you can and quit bitching about the rat race were all in

GetMotivated,removed,yup after a few terrible things that happened in the world recently mainly orlando my hometown people wouldnt shut up about it i wanted so badly to have my input and realized that after ten minutes of writing something to someonei just deleted it it was a waste of time i didnt want to continue that conversation with those people who probably wouldnt change their minds anyway even thinking that they were ignorant or that they were wrong was a waste of my time i just check up on my friends from time to time and actually chat with them instead of getting lost in the feed

GetMotivated,removed,honestly its just full of a lot of shitposting memers trolls etc a few times a fortnight a genuinely interesting post happens but i generally find most stuff to be low effortquality the real work is getting done over at rgetdisciplined
GetMotivated,removed,i managed to pay and say thank you while avoiding eye contact this was before the burqa so wait she ended up wearing a burqa i digress before i even begin but my point is the fuck it does not get easier it just gets to where you learn to cope with certain shit but thats not by any means getting easier sounds to me like you hit it lucky you were falling for this complete stranger before even knowing her who is themselves at their job meanwhile she is a secret meth head what if you had hooked up and she then because youre sooooo infatuated with her ended up hooking you on her meth habit think it couldnt happen everyone thinks that then theire sucking cock behind winn dixxie for a bowl of meth or whatever meth is offered asthe fuck if i ever want to know if its easier it aint worth your time
GetMotivated,removed,are all of you trolling me right now i feel paranoid you all know bradley just made this up as a joke right he bought a couple of two dollar steaks and rolled up in his cart he got kicked out by the grocery store bouncers and she was caught burning meth in the warehouse bathroom the manager wouldnt give him her dox youre all trolling me theres no way that people took this sarcastic story seriously i need a drink you beat me today reddit you beat me you made me question my sanity tomorrow is another day though
GetMotivated,removed,so does turning them into a football when they annoy the shit out of you
GetMotivated,removed,brazzers
GetMotivated,removed,well apparently whatever proper decisions you made in life didnt stop you from becoming an asshole im just as successful as you if not moreso the difference is you let it turn you into a worthless piece of shit that looks down on everyone while i see the value in inspiring people to do betterand sticking up for them when assholes like you show up you need to take your ass back to square one and learn some goddamn humility and compassion to go along with your proper choices
GetMotivated,removed,this is what many people will be saying after four years of trump

GetMotivated,removed,why do so many engineers on reddit come across as massive pricks is that like an elective you had to take
GetMotivated,removed,ahh so you have a chip on your shoulder then if you arent a troll which you appear to be then congratulations for overcoming your adversities but whatever the case may be you obviously have a whole lot of growing up to do youre pretty ignorant and immature for a supposedly intelligent and driven individual
GetMotivated,removed,dude i cant be the first person to say this but i wanted to let you know that you can write especially that last line damn
GetMotivated,removed,you never answered that dudes question use your teenage brain to help him you clearly have it figured out and are definitely not simplifying anything lol

GetMotivated,removed,i think you read my comment wrong i dont go to bars and dont want to meet anyone there lol
GetMotivated,removed,oh go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,people who blindly hate anything child molesters terrorists you name it will nearly universally see any kind of understanding of that thing as sympathising with the hated thing if they understand it better however they will know how to avoid the negative repercussions of that thing that they hate so that they dont have to fear it as much ironically their hate makes them unable to effectively cope with dealing with the hated thing also with the example of child molesters people assume that all child molesters are year old balding men with rusted windowless rape vans that assumption based on intentional ignorance fueled by hate or anger or fear allows the actual child molesters who really can be anyone man or woman young or old to practice their desires in the relative peace of the unexamined so in this way does the one who is angry become the one who is burned compare to one who is not hateful but rather critical they will examine the child molester learn about what causes their behaviors and what things to look out for warning signs etc whereas the hater just seeks to think about the child molester as little as possible a selfdefeating means to an end
GetMotivated,removed,yeah i have a lot of motiviation when it comes to people understanding child molesters better people often assume that all child molesters are pedophiles and that all pedophiles are child molesters neither of those things are true thats pretty much the point of this account so yeah a lot of light shed
GetMotivated,removed,make sure to check out my facebook page for more inspiring quotes facebookcomchasereinermotivation
GetMotivated,removed,do i have to this was the top by another time this link was
GetMotivated,removed,forced to only view the content and avoid each other on this sub or else be overrun with negativity
GetMotivated,removed,probably because if a picture motivates you then you have no real focus in life anyway and i think weve all been there but i think most people who come to this sub do it for some insight into taking action this quote is dumb and doesnt offer much value to be excited about mundane shit would be biochemically and emotionally exhausting to fake being hypomanic everyday is definitely a recipe for failure yeah sure it makes sense if youve spent a portion of your life thinking youre going to die but not everyone has those experiences thats why everyone thinks this quote is dumb if youre one of the few that is now unreasonably excited about all sorts of mundane shit thanks to this picture then more power to you
GetMotivated,removed,im gonna print this out and put it up all around where they have the local pedophile meeting not for them but because im white hot crazy about putting up posters
GetMotivated,removed,well thats casually ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,is this sub a default that might be a part of the problem motivation is fleeting right up there with inspiration but discipline and commitment takes grind and focus people dont like to hear thatmost people want a magic pill so its easier to complain than to take the wisdom of others and push ourselves to greatness thats why i rarely read the comments in this sub i look at the posts use what works for me leave the rest alone
GetMotivated,removed,i understand the sentiment here but this is a really patronizing article
GetMotivated,removed,so years old twat like you can get motivated
GetMotivated,removed,i wonder if he was white hot passionate about being a pedophile
GetMotivated,removed,i had a teacher who met him once apparently he was a prick
GetMotivated,removed,that is the situation where things like the images you find on this sub or inspirational videos come in handy theyre like an insulin shot and small motivational kick in the pants to get you back into your rhythm besides that introspection go for a long walk be content and happy remind yourself why youre doing what you do then the moment you get back to your workspace go to town on it
GetMotivated,removed,white hot and passionate is the only thing to be i can imagine racist skinheads quoting only this line
GetMotivated,removed,its really easy to miss the significance of that statement the first time hearing it this gif really made me appreciate it there are a lot of quotes like that throughout the franchise but youre bound to take one or two for granted no matter what it just shows how excellently the characters have been written this was the top by another time this link was

GetMotivated,removed,god damn you suck so much that you tried to deliberately die and you still failed
GetMotivated,removed,youre worried about the legal ramifications of committing suicide youre either a troll or incredibly dense
GetMotivated,removed,want a medal fucking attention whore
GetMotivated,removed,check out all the down votes i wanna commit suicide but i dont want to go to jail afterwards help
GetMotivated,removed,if only you googled reasons not to kill yourself instead
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,and my advice is to love your life and if you dont have a reason keep breathin out of spite cause thats a form of selflove too some days i fight just so i can tell my demons hey fuck you guante
GetMotivated,removed,maybe ill get banned from this subreddit for this but here goes this is fucking pathetic you utter utter sack of shit if you are genuinely suicidal then go see a doctor but i doubt you actually are because you have googled a few things and youve posted it on reddit in search of some internet points christ what the fuck has this world come to
GetMotivated,removed,christ what a fucking attention whore posting a picture of your search history to a subreddit why dont you just post a picture of a razor with some shitty lyrics superimposed on it like all the other whiney teenage girls on facebook

GetMotivated,removed,advice for whites these rules apply after you are accelerated and covered by white privilege
GetMotivated,removed,guess he was holding u back
GetMotivated,removed,you only need to know yourself the white race alone is capable of thoughtful introspection the blacks and abos are savages little better than animals the muslims are driven by unnatural lusts and hatred the hindus and orientals are weak and effeminate and the jews are greedy and manipulative but the white alone is capable of finding happiness through doing the right thing know your heritage know your roots if you stay true to your blood you will always find happiness dont fall for the traitors who try to weaken our race the liberals want to destroy the west by opening us to wave after wave of third world immigration and allowing those savages to rape our wives and daughters the christians sold our peoples souls for the sake of a monotheistic semitic heresy and turned their back on our heathen heritage and the jew run media and industry try to work us to death with work weeks and corporate greed and unions which are outright communist but if you can resist it you can uplift yourself and our race

GetMotivated,removed,in my experience many inspo quotes seem to come from people who spend most of their time in the gym while their dedication and hard work is great the goals they set are so arbitrary and dont seem to have a realworld purpose yet they act like theyre doing gods work i dont need your patronizing pinterest memes it clearly bugs me a lot
GetMotivated,removed,this is why i should be allowed to fap at the beach and on the bus

GetMotivated,removed,bullshit words coming from a talentless idiot we all judge each other all the time thats why he is so desperate for attention and cares a great deal what people think he doesnt act like a massive twat because he doesnt care what people think he does it because he cares so much what people think
GetMotivated,removed,the doorman of the my apartment building watches me every morning when i leave and every night when i get home he never says hi and seems like a bit of a prick i think he wishes i walk out the front door and get hit by a bus
GetMotivated,removed,i judge people all the time that guy wearing a fedora judged but after like minutes i dont even think about guy with fedora and the next day unless someone brings it up i wont even remember him
GetMotivated,removed,lol i love this but its so untrue in the real world of work people judge everything try to pick themselves up and put others down and can be subconsciously racistsexist as hell all people do is judge and categorize its not personal some people just do it to feel better about themselves
GetMotivated,removed,youd be surprised sometimes you can hear a certain phrase or something and it will change your entire attitude like one time i was standing in the shower feeling shitty about myself i was thinking about how unlikable and how fucked in the head i must be to not fit in with anyone just generally feeling depressed then i thought to myself well at least im not a pedophile those guys are really fucked and i just felt pretty okay all of a sudden so whenever youre feeling down about yourself as a person just remind yourself that at least you arent a pedophile
GetMotivated,removed,russel brand is a massive twat for lack of a better description
GetMotivated,removed,well that just sounds stupid and pretty ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,the fact i can find examples of people whose lives were heavily impacted negatively or outright ruined by shit like social media completely destroys this mostly thanks to sjw lynch mobs this might have been true a decade or more ago but now typical every day activities can be pulled up at will when ever someone decides to fuck with you i take several precautions but its completely fucked i have to

GetMotivated,removed,as im just now at this moment getting up at am to go to the gym after years of trying to force myself and failing i finally do it on a consistent basis and couldnt be happier i never was good at fighting myself because i love my self i want my self to feel good discipline isnt about learning how to beat my mind and body into submission like some slave if i do that the mind and body ultimately strongly resist instead discipline is about learning how to work with your mind and body as a team learning what your body and mind need and want for it to also be willing to do what im willing to do self knowledge and cooperation is hard in the sense that it takes skill and practice but it isnt painful where on the other hand forcing ones self is painful but takes little skill just brute force how this looks is that i know i hate getting up if im really tired so i go to sleep earlier i know my mind hates the jarring sound of an alarm clock so i use a nice song to wake me up i know my mind doesnt like the idea of waking up and thinking right away so i make sure all of my clothes and things to go to the gym are ready before i go to sleep so i can just roll out of bed and get my preworkout i know that my mind likes the stimulant from the preworkout out so i remind myself of it when my song plays as a motivation to get out of bed by visualizing drinking my preworkout today i did all these things and also reminded myself that my workout only lasted an hour and then i had the whole day after all these things are me creating motivation for myself this all happened within a second or two however force would treat the situation like get the fuck up you lazy fuck time to get to the gym and stop being a fat ass and then my mind and body feel not cared for and poorly treated which causes a counter productive effect of causing me to feel unmotivated both lead me to the gym at am however one works way better with lots of added benefits here is a link to where i first got this idea httpcharleseisensteinnetbooksthemorebeautifulworldourheartsknowispossiblestruggle hope this all helps you learn how to be disciplined and work with yourself to create motivation for your dreams its a delicate and skilled process but well worth the practice

GetMotivated,removed,what a load of shit ive seen tonnes of soulless discipline burnouts the correct path lies in having a balance consistently striving learning to accept failure and learn from it being a tease is an art one way i motivate myself to write more music is i always stop of the way through my inspiration spree i stop while i still have a desire to continue writing this nourishes that desire more and makes me want to come back reasons and why you ought to do something are also very important to keep in mind if you truly believe something to be stupid and ultimately of no value you wont want to do it maybe its not motivation that a person lacks there is just compelling reason to do something be more true to yourself and others speak your real objections out loud example i dont want to do this because x or y if you want to convince me go ahead and try but unless you can show me that this action or thing has merit i wont do it
GetMotivated,removed,so now all people need is the ability to force themselves to do things awesome thats like telling people to just make more money this sub is so silly sometimes
GetMotivated,removed,look at yourself in the mirror and tell me what a man is without pride tell my what a man is without fire in his eyes tell me who the fuck you are find who you are and the motivation will come but dont get fooled motivation is a shitty motivator
GetMotivated,removed,insulting people expecting them to respond to it in a positive manner is an excercise in futility youre about as socially inept as a toddler sees username either youre trolling or youre an asshole regardless leave the sub youre defeating the by bringing everyone down with your bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,or make friendspretty much anyone feel like you dont respect them i fucking hate people who do this if you disagree with my opinion thats fine but dont pretend to listen to me and then just go do whatever you want thats being an asshole
GetMotivated,removed,good read thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,removed,trolls be trolls but this is the internet and yiu clearly feel the need to down people that are looking for positivity fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,i saw it on facebook it must be true ignorant facebook user
GetMotivated,removed,okay you explained it thanks but what if i told you motivational on this subreddit is actually inspiration motivation is a reason inspiration is what you see on this thread get motivated get a reason to do something once you get the reason from inspirational quotes then you become motivated to do something forever then you should automatically be disciplined enough to follow through the rest of the steps if you have a problem with any of these then go to rgetmotivated and look at a quote that you relate to and find your reasoning behind it hence get motivated you shouldnt have problems here find your good reasoning to do something should be just something you want to do for whatever reason this is where inspirational quotes come in at do it if you have trouble with this then rgetdisciplined can help yet all they do is give you motivation also to get disciplined hence get disciplined
GetMotivated,removed,theres always so much negativity in the comments of this sub just interpret the quote however you want to interpret it and move the fuck on
GetMotivated,removed,the comments here are sad obviously no one is implying you ignore everyone of the time and piss off everyone you care about youve never had a moment in your life where your parents or friends or family or coworkers gave you advice or told you to startstop doing something that went completely against your own convictions your own opinions and passions or your own ideas and plans i have ive had people give me the worst possible advice for me ever simply because they had a differing opinion and ive had plenty of people try to push their own convictions on me without pause because they believed they were right in certain circumstances this advice could actually help you save relationships would you rather argue with someone whos suppose to be your friend or just smile and move on with your life some of you can be so dense
GetMotivated,removed,people on this sub live around very troubled and discouraging people if i followed this advice i would be doing literally nothing but play video games and eat junk food
GetMotivated,removed,no this sucks because its basically lying so fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,sounds an awful lot like a recipe for being a self righteous prick actually irrespective of whether its actually correctly attributed
GetMotivated,removed,jesus didnt even look like that dumbass
GetMotivated,removed,to be fair this image is basically saying fuck using motivation as your constant source of fuel im sure if you asked the person from the image if they were motivated for something theyd say yes but later they realize that motivation alone wasnt going to cut it building discipline is separate from finding motivation of course you have to find motivation to build that discipline but thats where people get caught up in the argument there is no one motivation youre motivated to do a large number of things in life so the motivation to get disciplined and the motivation to reach your end goal arent really the same thing most of these arguments start because things are taken out of context or people do something like speak in absolutes or its a issue of semantics all of this bickering when everyone has a point its just that they present it in a way that causes debate
GetMotivated,removed,fallacyyyyy
GetMotivated,removed,yet another rgetmotivated post which hitler must have thought
GetMotivated,removed,sounds a bit rapey
GetMotivated,removed,didd i tell you to kill yourself no if you want a simple life thats fine i think mostly everybody just wants to live in peace

GetMotivated,removed,that should be the motto for this sub
GetMotivated,removed,this response literally gave me cancer the only thing it proved to me is that the drafter has a tremendous view of his dedeum

GetMotivated,removed,alluding to me being sexist is really really stupid these days both men and women alike writecowrite which is probably why music has gotten to be a lot of shit when it comes to the popular stuff some of my favorite artists include billie holiday ella fitzgerald the hush sound to name a few i think female vocalists are awesome and i probably prefer them to most male vocalists these days anyhow how do you know im not a music business insider also read up cupcake plenty of articles that will teach you all you need to know and some great books on how the industry is ran while obviously im not a famous artist i have done some recordings with a couple bands and have read plenty all the stuff i said is true you just have to read for yourself and educate yourself about it cheers

GetMotivated,removed,my neckbeard and i are off to do some cocaine now
GetMotivated,removed,i uh why do people eat this this sort of stuff up this honestly reads like something my sexist asshole uncle would say while he claps me on the back women are fucking crazy things i just dont understand this weird artificial gender divide what happened to treating people like human beings
GetMotivated,removed,go to rredpill and youll understandhard for me to accuratelyfairly describe them
GetMotivated,removed,yeah man why cant we say all women are fucking crazy things without people saying were sexist s
GetMotivated,removed,just ask her out that part is true the rest is just a mix of awful misogynist bullshit women are crazy things and embarassing neckbeard loser cringe women only go for the assholes not the nice guys
GetMotivated,removed,alright ill give you a serious response i dont feel that what i said is so sexist it doesnt deserve a serious response but ok nobody is arguing that there arent quantifiable differences between groups such as genders theres a reason gender is a relevant characteristic in most sociological studies we are in agreement but why would you take patterns like that which likely derive from social upbringing and thinking like this and apply them to the individual because as humans we generalize and put odds on certain outcomes it helps us survive if x attribute is prevalent in x group then it is more likely than not a specific person in x group shares the attribute if you ignore this you are going to be worse off than someone who doesnt now im not saying you have to hate the group in order to recognize an attribute of that group theres no reason not to strive for a society where people dont feel constrained to behave in a certain way or labelled as something because of their gender i dont see how they are and i dont get what alternative you are suggesting you seem to agree that a group can have an attribute but think everyone should ignore the attribute because the fact that they have it might hurt their feelings
GetMotivated,removed,nothing turns off more than neediness from her man id hope to get some loving back and im not talking about sex
GetMotivated,removed,it was only a link to rtheredpill and something along the lines of check this out its easier than explaining it i will have a look to satisfy my curiosity but it sounds like its nothing i havent read before
GetMotivated,removed,yes agreed in this old bastards opinion that was simply some very good advice i believe its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all tf dr seuss put me on the right track when he said those that mind dont matter and those whomatter dont mind yup ya gots to ngaf except when you want to gaf you cant let the other motherfuckers get under your skin in this life and that goes like times for women who after a lifetime of practice being bitchy with each other are able to say so much hurtful shit in sentences i know guys whore still recovering from a nasty paragraph said in the heat of the moment a year ago that can never be unsaid much guilty cringing almost everyone who plays with love fucks it up and gets hurt but i reckon thats the whole idea that is until one learns about the differences between loving adelle loving your dog or even loving your gf after ngaf is you must know what type of loving youre doing and how silly we are in the west to use the same words to describe feelings for our job dog car mates gfs mates in the first place theyre not the same and we all know that but its not like we agree on what kinds of love they are either we were never taught in school or by the dictionary to differentiate and thats fubar imo and so finally the time comes that the novices learn about the differences in these the ancient greeks had six words to describe love eros phila ludus agape pragma and philutia
GetMotivated,removed,this quote seems to have metaphysical underpinnings basically its wrong and inconsistent with contemporary philosophical ideas

GetMotivated,removed,just because people give you upvotes doesnt mean youre a good person plato
GetMotivated,removed,dont tell me what to do
GetMotivated,removed,this is bullshit op is oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything to the discussion
GetMotivated,removed,i dont understand comments like this are you aware of any court information which we the public do not have or do you just regularly dole out judgements in cases where you are entirely ignorant maybe wait until the guy has a trial before you throw things out there
GetMotivated,removed,but why would you take patterns like that which likely derive from social upbringing and thinking like this and apply them to the individual the question you really should be asking is why has society endorsed these ideologies in the first place if a person has been raised in an enviroment where a certain belief is considered perfectly normal aka indoctrination eg its normal for parents to play an elaborate hoax on young children about a completely fictitious and imaginary entity known as santa claus aka father christmas in many places yet i know of people who consider doing such a thing especially year after year to be pretty fucked up and a great way to give your kid some screwy ideas about honesty i once met this very spun out and unstable ex tweaker woman who actually said to me ill never forget it when i found out when i was that father christmas and the easter bunny werent real i never trusted my parents again after that sadly ive met quite a few people who have incidents from their very early years which are still affecting them till this day crazy hey rather than propagate these rather pointless stereotypes like what how do you deal with facts like women have babies men do not or that generally speaking the stereotypical human male tends to be physically stronger than the stereotypical human female would you still have an issue if i dropped the stereo bit and just said typical malefemale whats wrong with acknowledging there are differences between the sexes and then making it nbd thats the only way to make these differences truly insignificant however the problem i see is that until a specific trait ie having a penis is first recognised and acknowledged and then agreed upon by both sides that its not a trait that should in any way define the traitholder afaic most people need to learn about themselves and check the log in their own eyes rather than bitching about a splinter in the other persons we need to become individually responsible for our actions coz youre not going to get any useful changes if you try and force people to comply with laws they dont agree with drug laws are a perfect example of how many people are prepared to be noncompliant re the current legal status quo of recreational drugs in most countries
GetMotivated,removed,the children that do not respect or fear their parents will openly cuss them out do not listen do not essentially seem to give a fuck about their parents authority what is the solution for them of which there are so many the kids that yell fuck you mom when she asks them to do things i dont see the low crime rates as a result of raising kids nicer rather the heavy media usagegaming movies tv dumbed down entertainment culture distraction entertainment based news feminism of society promotion of an alcoholic and now also stoner society general ease of life being in the country that sits on top and of course the widespread use of pharmaceutical drugs that numb alter or control peoples moods its more like correlation that reduced spankings have lowered crime and increased happiness than is the causation of it i suppose thats some form of autonomy and yes that does exist to some extent but not completely as you are always bound by business needs i dont see how your point about autonomy is relevant what needs to change to you autonomy wise i have plenty of autonomy in my job given it being a middle level position i dont really expect more more like my arguments are based on reading books from famous psychologists philosophers and studying the development of societies and civilization you and i look at people fundamentally differently
GetMotivated,removed,everyone is the perfect work by god so we need to follow our heart
GetMotivated,removed,but wouldnt you rather live a good life that was unfairly cut short than a long life as an awful bastard isnt one day as a lincoln better than a lifetime as a wilkes booth what are we even living for if not to feel good about ourselves im honestly kinda shocked to see so many people countering this quote with examples of how being good wont necessarily get you wealth and fame the point is that you can live a very successful life as an absolute prick but none of that success is worth knowing youre not an absolute prick

GetMotivated,removed,this sub just seems like fucking year old girls posting on facebook then the occasional year old
GetMotivated,removed,i dont know but i do i think its either the simplicity of people who are willing to believe everything as long as it gives them a little hope in life even if its just for a couple of seconds escaping from reality knowing there is a little kid out there who hasnt experienced life at its most brutal and the slight hope that they soon might see the life as bright as the kid who wrote this knowing it is possible to enjoy life at its fullest which actually makes it kinda beautiful and inspiring either that or theyre just fucking idiots wholl believe everything they read on the internet and are probably the ones who have to be told that not everything you read on facebook is true

GetMotivated,removed,did you not make a response to
GetMotivated,removed,are you an idiot or a troll i didnt straw man you i said nobody said michael phelps doesnt work hard in response to your post so what was the intent of the post did you not mean to imply they were saying that why did you reply to them saying that generally when someone makes a correcting statement in a reply it is a correction of the person they are replying too proof its a correcting statment use of just because doesnt mean
GetMotivated,removed,wow pedophile letting a child beat you for shame
GetMotivated,removed,haters sitting at home living with their parents haters still sitting at home living with their parents hating
GetMotivated,removed,thats a load of shit it also depends on genetics timing and wealth enough genetics to be tall enough and strong enough to compete the timing to start training and the money to achieve it you think a year old man who has a full time job has enough to beat michael phelps in his prime
GetMotivated,removed,i didnt realize that disagreeing labels you as argumentative negative and angry my initial post wasnt negative or angry it could be described as argumentative because it was in reply to a pre existing argument i only responded the way i did because i realize how little you had to say besides this sub is for motivation plz stop saying anything that isnt positive this shows the underlying problem of this sub motivation is not synonymous with positively it helps to be positive but it also help to recognize your faults this isnt rfeelgood everyone should recognize both that micheal phelps trys very hard at what he does and that he is a natural born swimmer and you shouldnt expect to perform like him just because you try as hard as you can

GetMotivated,removed,why the fuck do redditors constantly praise these fuckheads torturing kids and putting some bullshit motivational crap on the end and pretending its okay that kid was just made to spend fucking months learning to throw a ball in a hoop you want to do your kid some good teach him some other skills until hes the right size for an adult hoop that and stop pushing your own failed dreams onto him
GetMotivated,removed,i think being explained the value of dedication and commitment towards a goal is something a child can comprehend kids are a lot smarter than we give them credit for and saying shit like if you dont practice you dont play a childs instinct would be to rebel and say fine then fuck you too gotta meet each other half way
GetMotivated,removed,nah successful people are constantly doing things to get ahead if you just instantly do all your work so you can fuck off youre still not getting ahead

GetMotivated,removed,as far as finding yourself you cant there is a qoute life isnt about finding yourself life is about creating yourself so in regards to what you want to do with your life some people have some pretty good advice the first person that comes to mind is cal newport he talks about why follow your passion is bad advice in a nut shell his advice is to learn a particular set of skills become so good that people cant ignore you then leverage those skills to obtain a remarkable life for yourself is a great interview with him if youre not sure what to do and since you have a lot of spare time read books on topics your interested in i recommend memoirs and biographies about the specific fields your interested law – bad idea the market is saturated so its hard to find a decent job unless you went to a top tier school andor have connections finance – accounting is a solid career landscape architecture – dont know what that is psychology – bad major you wont gain any skills just stick to reading psychology books in your leisure time and dont think travel will help you solve your problems because at the end of it you will still be the same person with the same problems just older a person a question to reddit asking if traveling would solve his problems the thread is pretty insightful basically the op came to the conclusion running away wouldnt solve any of his problems he realized his dissatisfaction stemmed from him not progressing in several areas of his life financial health relationship and career to sum it all up forget about finding yourself pick something your interested in and get good at it have goals for other areas of your life and make sure your making progress toward them if your still unsure about college there is a httpsdiscoverpraxiscom that is for young people to apprentice at a start up if you interested in any of the companies they work with give it a shot
GetMotivated,removed,for you maybe
GetMotivated,removed,heres a post i wrote up after weeks cold turkey may be helpful quality of life increased a ton id say almost as much as starting exercise or starting meditation its been that powerful
GetMotivated,removed,does anyone else find these types of posts or any self help stuff just like one big masturbation session for the people writing them oh god everyone look at me im doing things everyone has to over come shit why do you have to post a fucking book long thing about you and everything youve done
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,yep todays great ill wake up and go to work come home masturbate and go to sleep this stupid shit is senseless sometimes shit sucks making the most of the moment is great and all but that doesnt always put you where the fuck you want to be work out save your money invest in the future do something where you know something will be better in the future this fake ass shit doesnt motivate you if anything its demotivational
GetMotivated,removed,the way i see it we are all part of the same human race a race of lizardbrained monkeys that found ourselves in possession of tanks and missiles before we had learned to love each other humanity is a tribal species hitler found his lizardbrain involved in unforgivable genocide and his actions are certainly not to be loved can we love the man himself however how about baby hitler the hitler before he had committed any attrocities at all i find it easy to say i can certainly love that human being then there is the racist that hitler became with all of the atrocities and hatred that he possessed would a hitler born in sweden have gone on to push the same agenda i dont think so and so i think it is not so much the man that everyone hates but the circumstances and decisions that man made in his racist and bleak environment i say yes hitler deserves love all of mankind deserves love no one asks to be born we pop out surrounded by preexisting traditions structures people and society lays on top of the world around us all these notions about which traditions to follow how to live your life and which people are good and bad still today in the middle east there are islamic schools teaching their children to hate americans before they even have a chance to form their own view of the world i love all people to the best of my ability no matter their shortcomings or the atrocities they commit admittedly it can be hard i think hitler deserves love as do all of his victims more love and less hate can only help our vicious species i cant see why
GetMotivated,removed,get off anti depressants feel the pain
GetMotivated,removed,hey there youre not alone this sub is largely happygolucky bullshit posted by getting over their breakup not a good place to get any decent motivation
GetMotivated,removed,go fuck yourself i saw somebody else post it up after i did
GetMotivated,removed,i only wish i could show that to my other half but i know she wouldnt understand
GetMotivated,removed,youre a fucking white male
GetMotivated,removed,why is this here like how is this motivating for me
GetMotivated,removed,thanks for the post
GetMotivated,removed,some people on this sub have the weirdest ideas for what constitutes as motivation
GetMotivated,removed,i dont see how this is relevant to this sub men and women in the western world are more or less equally privileged its just that the privileges and expectations are different and people value privileges differently eg men usually value access to casual sex more highly than most women do so women have a privilege that men dont although the value of this privilege varies according to how much the person in question values casual sex
GetMotivated,removed,people like to toss around a story but its often misinterpreted there was really no point at which more didnt correlate with more happiness
GetMotivated,removed,this one well it just seems like hes trying to convince us that hes different when after reading it i just dont see it i dont think hes different from us assuming youre someone that is millenial or early genxer but i think our outlook is radically different from the generation which came before us that happens with many generations but the difference in current times is that we have the ability to capture and document these huge differences en masse via the internet were so connected that we can communicate and come to common understandings whereas before previous generations were changing from their parents but they were locally isolated tv and rockandroll changed little jimmy and jane but they were still relatively confined to their town and peers around them you couldnt talk back with a tv but now you can and instead of growing up with maybe hundreds of peers youre now growing up with tens of thousands hell when i think about the number of people ive interacted with on reddit simply reading comments or responding it has to be close to a million people i mean one upvote is one person right i dont think hes uncommon it does seem a little pompous but i do think the world were in right now is changing the definition of success and happy for all of us and its a discussion worth having i wish i was a sociologist instead of an engineer i find people really fascinating
GetMotivated,removed,reminds me of pretty much everything from this sub that goes to all the rest seems to be variations on life doesnt suck you suck do something about it btw doing something about it is gonna suck
GetMotivated,removed,has this sub become satire

GetMotivated,removed,a fine line separates a beard from a neckbeard one is motivated by reason the other by purpose one beards to live while the other lives to beard
GetMotivated,removed,clearly someone who didnt excel and wasnt motivatedits tough to see the larger picture when most are young but the few that do exceed theres no single test in education education is a compilation of many tests such as attendance daily work short term and long term tests and projects shortsighted and ignorant opinion if you feel that way about the current education system
GetMotivated,removed,just casually doing his job then the guy proves multiple dimensions speed of light and helps to explains how gravity works

GetMotivated,removed,yesterday was that day as well but
GetMotivated,removed,i dont directly harm anyone unless thats the only option left maybe one day youll realize that while the masses are stronger there is too much division for them to ever be a threat most of them are jealous and want what we have undermining us would mean from their pov that they give up on achieving what they want you dont actively try to change society to favor something you are but dont want to be all ive read so far is conjecture people dont care about what others do not really they do care about image and appearances of my friends know me well well enough to know that im harmless and good company unless they stand between me and what i want they accept that and have done so for the past years ive got too much empathy i care too much the only way to deal with that is to keep everything out i refuse to act on my emotions they just get in the way i may have no conscience in that i dont feel bad when i have to step on people when there is no other choice between that or not doing anything but i do feel guilt when something like that could have been avoided life is a game getting ahead and on top is fun and competing against others is as well but in the end its about winning there are too many people and once of them become obsolete because of robots i do not want to be amongst the poor
GetMotivated,removed,not true i have to work with a lot of negative people that will tear you apart if you dont respond or awknowlenge them
GetMotivated,removed,this is insipid at least this sub is consistent in its churning out of inane shit
GetMotivated,removed,lets see how it wouldve turned out if we didnt respond to mr negative hitler
GetMotivated,removed,bs its a case by case kind of thing some people are better off being totally ignored and will stop bothering while others will just keep coming back until the one time you put them in their place its not a matter of insulting its a matter of pushing back its a matter of not being pushed
GetMotivated,removed,no thanks i dont want to be a doormat
GetMotivated,removed,this isnt motivational its just advice and an unnecessary image
GetMotivated,removed,well i work at a fucking restaurant so
GetMotivated,removed,this is how bullies become bullies by no one ever stepping up to them
GetMotivated,removed,k
GetMotivated,removed,but if i gather their anger i become more powerful

GetMotivated,removed,the words of a coward
GetMotivated,removed,fuck that this is how you end up a pushover
GetMotivated,removed,i live in jersey this isnt possible ya friggin mook

GetMotivated,removed,how is this motivation this is just shitty life advice
GetMotivated,removed,what kind of bs is this
GetMotivated,removed,let the hate flow through you
GetMotivated,removed,definitely not true you have to look underneath the iceberg and understand that this person will ruin your day regardless talking back or not you will internalize everything that occurred after for days
GetMotivated,removed,easy to say somewhat selfish sometimes negative people are family and friends in need deal with the issues everyone will grow
GetMotivated,removed,this sub should just be renamed shitty facebook memes
GetMotivated,removed,sounds like advice for non witty wusses
GetMotivated,removed,i feel like everyone that subscribes to this sub is autistic

GetMotivated,removed,but not really
GetMotivated,removed,but but but sometimes its fun to make them angry 😭
GetMotivated,removed,actually and this quote is such bullshit written by a passive teenager who lives with his mom and who has never been out in the real world the only way to respond to fire is with more fire so that the motherfucker who dared fuck with you is burnt screaming and crying for his cocksucking parents to come and save his worthless ass
GetMotivated,removed,but fiery comebacks are the best comebacks
GetMotivated,removed,dont agree some people will try to walk over you they need to know when they cross te line
GetMotivated,removed,all response should always be proportional if you yell at me i am going to yell back if you touch me without my consent i am going to punch you
GetMotivated,removed,its fun doing that though fuck being the socalled bigger person
GetMotivated,removed,stupid advice tbh dont let people walk over you
GetMotivated,removed,bullshit the less you respond the crazier they get
GetMotivated,removed,when i was in middle school some kids picked on me on the bus when i talked to my parents about it they told me to just ignore them as i would only be giving them what they wanted if i reacted i took that advice to heartand it got worse eventually one day they pelted me in the back of the head with two full tubes of tennis ballsit sounds like it would be merely unpleasant and that would be true if one of the kids hadnt been the varsity pitcher for our high school baseball team as i sat there holding the back of my head shaking with anger and shame face red holding back tears the one who had been nicest to me came up and asked if he could have the tennis balls back he promised to keep them away from them and after some words of consolation from him i reluctantly handed him the tennis balls i wasnt going to cave by responding i wasnt going to let them win about a minute later the next tennis ball smacked me in the back of the head i stood up on a moving bus and i choked out a roar like a rabid dog their laughter went silent i told them that if i got hit with a tennis ball i was going to come back there and start hitting people i didnt care who it was and i didnt care who tried to stop mei told them that i would take all of them on at once and that the only way id stop would be if they knocked me unconscious one kid snickeredthe big dumb lunkhead guy the worst of the bunch i tucked my keys between my knuckles blade out pointed at him hand shaking and said that he would be first and that i knew he would beat my ass in a fair fight so i would just have to get him in the neck with these keys until i had opened up his windpipe enough for us to be on even terms his face went white i sat back down none of them ever bothered me again sometimes the only thing people understand is overwhelming escalation and the fear of a threat being carried out
GetMotivated,removed,thank you the gray quiet conflict shy mouse sliding the sub is going through is unbearable
GetMotivated,removed,fuck that hit em if i get downvoted insert i thought this was america meme

GetMotivated,removed,yeah turn the other cheek until youre beaten to death good plan
GetMotivated,removed,why is this a default dub why is this on the first page garbage advice seriously there are plenty of angry people who need to be shut down or they will continue to demean and degrade anyone who has worked in retail or service can back me up on this how about this one never speak in universals

GetMotivated,removed,yeah this is bs negativetoxic people will continue to tear others down as long as it is easy for them to do so
GetMotivated,removed,who says you have to be angry to insult someone you stupid fucking shitfag
GetMotivated,removed,this is the same type of horse shit that my dad tried to force on me through my life sounds nice but in reality it does not work at all it only serves to make matters worse
GetMotivated,removed,one stapler one mission httpssoundcloudcomchumbogstaple
GetMotivated,removed,the comments in this sub are fucking unbearable every single quotation post is someone trying to deconstruct outsmart andor criticize the premise youre brilliant we get it there are multiple ways to look at the world and everything is subjective youre adding nothing to the discussion in pathetically attempting to prove your worth by combatting every single quote take whatever value you can get from the message and if you find it valueless kindly fuck off to the next post enough already
GetMotivated,removed,however its amazing to me how so much of the younger generation falls for debate strategies that emplore loud emotional arguments and ad hominem attacks making a clear concise argument used to be the measure of a sufficient debate strategy but recently ive noticed that too many people are won over by who can scream bigot the loudest
GetMotivated,removed,the feeling of telling someone to shut the fudge up is sooo good
GetMotivated,removed,youre so pompous i am so glad i dont have to work with anyone remotely like you i feel bad for your coworkers
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you dumass go watch some more cartoons
GetMotivated,removed,what if the nastiness is from your exwife who is lying to take away your children i wish the world was that easy
GetMotivated,removed,and do what keep it in and let it consume you or till youll explode one day
GetMotivated,removed,a bunch of well meaning but less than brilliant people decide anything they dont want to hear is negative and thus use this fastfood philosophy to justify not listening to necessary words of warning
GetMotivated,removed,i agree with this but only if youre incapable of coming back with a tyrionlike quip
GetMotivated,removed,definitely not true it made my life hell because he was in half of my classes and everyone took his side
GetMotivated,removed,came here to avoid crap like this oh well back to facebook i guess
GetMotivated,removed,ah so youre just an ass with nothing better to do than troll you must lead such a fulfilling life
GetMotivated,removed,isnt that the whole basis of this picture
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off if someone attacks me i attack back no matter the collateral damage whats with all these hippies these days only subscribing to peace and love and positivity negativity and damage is needed in the balance of life aswell so gtfo u hippy fucks
GetMotivated,removed,until the paraplegic rolls through the door
GetMotivated,removed,thats not exactly the main point of debates ive watched many debates as an audience member where i went in with opinions and came out with them having been completely changed or altered debates work far more towards the audience and historically for society than for the individuals actually doing the debating but i can tell you what debates are not for and how so many younger people misinterpret them to be a screaming match between two people using ad hominem attacks and emotional reasoning either way theres no legitimate use that i can surmise for namecalling and ad hominem attacks other than for debators to win over ignorant audience members who legitimately believe that calling someone a bigot or a xenophobe is a valid argument and just because debates may happen to boil down to these cheap tactics does not in any way justify them in the first place
GetMotivated,removed,pretty sure thats how the sjw and liberal movement really picked up in the last years
GetMotivated,removed,mark twain was the guy who used to hang out with edison and get amusement out of playing with high voltage so that quote doesnt mean as much to me as it should
GetMotivated,removed,ironically enough all the young people i work with are much much better at what they do than those because they usually are the smartest people in the room this is because they actually bother to learn new things instead of bitching about how it doesnt work right they have a work ethos and its easy to see when certain said people also have it and get along just fine instead of complaining about other people it aint my fault you get paid a year to stare at endless papers on a desk and never bother to learn anything just because youre bitter youve wasted years on getting fat doesnt mean you cant do anything about it
GetMotivated,removed,im a little concerned this sub is becoming watered down with all the removed comments its rmotivation not rpositiveaffirmation a lot of these image posts overly simplify and undermine the entire concept of motivating unless its trolling censoring comments probably does the opposite of motivation
GetMotivated,removed,wait whoa whoa is this sub actually not being sarcastic
GetMotivated,removed,what if i allow their anger to become my trolling in an attempt to make them even angrier
GetMotivated,removed,whore whores await you there
GetMotivated,removed,equivalent to the number of dumb south park references youve made across your lifetime
GetMotivated,removed,aw puppy thinks were talking about side projects
GetMotivated,removed,hes autistic wonder if that had an effect
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,those of us who dislike rape and being a piece of shit have always not liked her
GetMotivated,removed,it should be noted that ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as i know that said in grade i took an sat test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment i knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything i scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area an iq test has shown me to be in the percentile for iq this is the highest result the test i was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test my mothers boyfriend of years is an aerospace engineer who graduated virginia tech at the age of i understand physics better than him and i owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics hes not particularly successful as an engineer but ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it im also pretty good at engineering i dont have a degree and other than physics i dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but i have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things for example i independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and i was only seven or eight years old when i started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan i have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy ive come across every question of existentialism which ive seen discussed in smbc or xkcd or reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is psychology i actually understand better than people with degrees unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which i dont have a very good understanding of i can debunk many of even sigmund freuds theories im a good enough writer that im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published and thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the internet ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it i dont know if that will suffice as evidence that im intelligent im done with it though because id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking the following are some examples of my morals and ethical code i believe firmly that everybody deserves a future if we were to capture hitler at the end of wwii i would be against executing him in fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it id even support the concept of letting him go free this is essentially because i think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them i dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others i dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others but i dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them i dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc i know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things i love everyone even people i hate i wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness rick perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but i wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible i wish this for everyone im pretty much a pacifist ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that the only time ill fight back is if the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and if i dont attack ill come out worse than the other person will if i do in other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me i dont fight back ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that im never in a situation where ill be worse off after a fight if im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries i really dont care the only exception is if someone is going after my life even then ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that i possibly can in protecting myself if someone points a gun at me and i can get out of it without harming them id prefer to do that over killing them i consider myself a feminist i dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally as in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord i treat women with the same outlook i treat men and never participate in the old reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities i dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome that doesnt mean i look for places to victimize women i just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings ok when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that im kind of tired of citing these examples and im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far in closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the reddit brony community where i spend most of my time and where im pretty known for being helpful around the community a lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and i spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so i guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments and uh im a pretty good moderator all that and i think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish so what do you think now that you at least slightly know me
GetMotivated,removed,this dudes bitch didnt take his name when he got married to her what a pussy xd

GetMotivated,removed,statistically speaking if he lost any significant weight hes fatter by now like a near certainty its near impossible he lost weight and kept it off this isnt inspiring its demotivating its inly inspiring if you ignore reality and focus on a delusion oh wait im in rgetmotivated arent i business as usual then forgot to unsub when i made this account
GetMotivated,removed,oh for fuckings sake this used to be an awesome place to get motivated now its just reposts and shitposts mainly
GetMotivated,removed,give up watching porn i used to be the same its called porn induced erectile dysfunction give it a google and no it doesnt just happen from chronic porn usage just a thought though could be an entirely different cause
GetMotivated,removed,this is the first thing ive seen on this sub in a long time which might actually help people with some motivation
GetMotivated,removed,the average male cannot post a selfie online and get those immediate validation comments from friends and family not that you should want them anyway theyre pretty vapid and empty
GetMotivated,removed,beauty is objective and multifaceted its more ignorant to live your life with such a solid view of beauty when really there are so many different ways you can see it experience it that stay within the original definition and feeling people get in their bodies
GetMotivated,removed,see i posted this same thing in rdepression and got obliterated in there amazing how different the mindset is in this sub in a really good way
GetMotivated,removed,there are some really great subreddits for meeting new people try posting a selfie httpswwwredditcomrroastmesubmit
GetMotivated,removed,are animal shelters actually okay with this as a person who is used to having five dogs then having no dogs and it definitely not being the right time for one ive always wondered if i can just mooch off the shelter
GetMotivated,removed,first time ive seen anything in this sub that wasnt a stupid circlejerk quote and was actually useful
GetMotivated,removed,ok lets see usually this sub is insufferable but ill give this one a tryagain perhaps some some nuts or hummus aaaaaaand im out
GetMotivated,removed,so ya know if your a popular girl and your having a bad day you can try these if your an ugly male loser you can probably juat go ahead and kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,omg man i know why youre telling me all this because ive been way too soft with people fuck off with your whiney crying bullshit and move the fuck on or dont move on but stop crying to me or to anybody about it
GetMotivated,removed,feeling suicidal drink a cup of water then take a selfie if you dont feel better in a week go ahead and kill yourself worst advice ever
GetMotivated,removed,the bellavei range of skin care products ensure that your skin is cared for with the gentleness of all natural products like vitamin c primrose oil extracts shea butter and aloe vera that have anti aging properties
GetMotivated,removed,not that i am but if youre currently homeless and broke this thing is pretty much telling you theres no hope for you just kill yourself please
GetMotivated,removed,take a goddamn selfie really fucking retarded
GetMotivated,removed,worst subreddit on rall ban me pls
GetMotivated,removed,precisely privilige i am not homeless but i am not exactly middleclass and i am jot american eitheralso a bit of a privilige and this subreddit really only gives advices for middleclass americans who think they are poor and miserable and if you show up in the comments they will bury you in downvotes insult you and tell you that its all possible but youre just being a pussy and even worse that meditation will solve all your problems or travelling the world will
GetMotivated,removed,oh fuck off its still a good message im none of those except white and facing depression though not mild
GetMotivated,removed,your pic before was better am i get getting banned for this sht
GetMotivated,removed,lol okay maybe that but see thatd be even more impressive than giving birth on seventeen separate occasions so daves kind of an ass
GetMotivated,removed,that photo this one too
GetMotivated,removed,i agree
GetMotivated,removed,i think is all the result of the perversion of free speech free speech has become synonymous with hate speech because we are constantly shown that the only ones toting free speech are those who preach hatred and are just assholes overall imagine if the only people arguing for free love weret the lgbtq community but pedophiles who want to have years olds as girlfriends and boyfriends of course then the concept of free love would be destroyed by disgust and hatred for the term this is what is happening to free speech it now doesnt mean the freedom to criticize public officials without the fear of being arrested or fined it means the freedom from pc culture and that is usually expressed through unconstrained hatred bigotry and disrespect trump uses his free speech to call mexicans rapists antitrump people use their free speech to erect statues of trump naked basically free speech has become nasty and impassioned without any middle ground of just being opinions in a sea of opinions the result of that are these approved thoughts that dont offend other people and dont tread into the free speech territory
GetMotivated,removed,yeah this sub is a mess of stupid shit that doesnt work
GetMotivated,removed,you dont need testicles to be a man some people have had testicle cancer some have had horrible accidents are they not men

GetMotivated,removed,gaslighting
GetMotivated,removed,because im little bitch
GetMotivated,removed,this is good advice for when youre choking someone
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,dude fuck all you people who come in here and shit all over these posts literally go fuck yourself look in the mirror and ask yourself why you feel the need to come into a sub that specifically for motivating people and shitting all over every post by injecting your poisonous negativity
GetMotivated,removed,except if you smoke
GetMotivated,removed,there is nothing motivating about a sub that where people shit all over every post in the comments someone could be literally hanging on for dear life read one of these posts have a moment of clarity and hope only to stumble into the comments to be met with these fucking cesspool toxic douches who infest all of reddit by needing to say why everything is wrong according to their cheetosencrusted worldview fuck them and fuck you for letting them shit all over every post
GetMotivated,removed,ahhh im starting to see how this works let me run this by you to make sure i understand perfectly mr dylan does something i think makes him look like an asshole i point out the fact that his actions make him look like an asshole you point out that my actions make me look like an asshole so what i am to understand is that i am not famous rich or powerful enough to reserve my right to point out when people are being jackasses well thats your opinion and its incorrect
GetMotivated,removed,dank memes
GetMotivated,removed,if you get bored of that come over to rsanctionedsuicide its awesome im having a whale of a time there
GetMotivated,removed,ill assume incorrectly it was a bad new years joke someone that was years old died on december then they were buried a few days later in
GetMotivated,removed,i had a boss who said this all the time weve been doing it this way for years ot years ago when i was doing this exact thing dude fuck off years ago the machines were new not half broken pieces of shit we now have to finagle to do what we need them to also years ago you were a moron and didnt realize there was an easier faster more precise a and cheaper way to do it
GetMotivated,removed,why do we need to progress
GetMotivated,removed,i feel like thats the answer i would get if i asked someone why we put tp on the tp spindle
GetMotivated,removed,wrong the most dangerous words are im from the government and im here to help
GetMotivated,removed,huh i thought it was good job
GetMotivated,removed,the surgeon reaches for the patient when another stops him no wait how about we mix it up what but weve always done it this way no thats the most dangerous sentence in the language but no buts he said shoving the tray out of the way and dropping a plastic heart filled with cheerios into the patient
GetMotivated,removed,because weve always done it that way said every arab parent ever
GetMotivated,removed,i thought the most dangerous language in the english language was lets nuke them first
GetMotivated,removed,so i guess we need cultural enrichment
GetMotivated,removed,thats exactly what i meant i thought it would be a pretty clear shorthand form so i took the liberty to lose the extra words paid off also thanks
GetMotivated,removed,is this a parody i think im liking this sub
GetMotivated,removed,did you just assume my gender bro
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,you stupid fucks episode aired in wife died in ﻿
GetMotivated,removed,i think its saying you should kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,this could mean something completely different to someone who sleepwalks my wife does and ive no desire to be a part of her dreams in that context
GetMotivated,removed,from my point of view american society looks like the opposite of what you have described americans always encourage each other to follow their dreams even this sub exist to motivate those who died at but most dont take any action just read and forget
GetMotivated,removed,i dont have a job that requires me to wear suits i mean i wear them a lot but i wear a ton of other stuff too all pretty fashionable a job that requires you to wear suits and you are a piece of shit if you dont would kill that enjoyment

GetMotivated,removed,i turned down a very lucrative career because of the horror stories i heard from one person i knew in that field personally i took another party and regretted it because it turns out that guy was just one of those people who will always be unhappy
GetMotivated,removed,great mindset to overcome your own obstacles not a place for poking fun in extremely poor taste that should be the first obstacle you fools ought to begin with i have already started mine and that is to speak up for anything that enrages me inspiration for and the courage to do something that i can choose to face head on or ignorantly fail to become i have no patience for ignorance and the pops of humor is this comment strong shows how ignorant people are get over yourself and forget that belief of your superiority over others your ego has so conveniently given you
GetMotivated,removed,well yeah everyone nonjudgmental
GetMotivated,removed,you are either a troll or a moron either way i am not going to discuss your ignorance any further
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is full of fucking nonsense bullshit jesus christ what a ragig pile of fucking shit
GetMotivated,removed,theyre not posting in rgetmotivated its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikisurvivorshipbias and its the reason there are lots of people cheering you on to chase your unlikely dreams
GetMotivated,removed,i feel the same way often it is called imposter syndrome i have it its ruined my last relationship of ten years and has ruined my professional development in some ways ive been combating this with a more structured daily routine and have been working hard on professional development its working i feel more confident in what i can accomplish
GetMotivated,removed,this sub has never been so real for me i need to get the fuck out of my job i hate humans where can i find a job without any other humans
GetMotivated,removed,i keep my resume updated and posted online and ive been employed holding a full time job about once every two months i get phone offers for jobs and about spam job offers in my email if i wanted to quit i could easily find another employeer without putting any effort into it
GetMotivated,removed,lol assuming that im assuming nice its pretty simple youre not trying to actively improve your situation and therefore have no valid complaints who else is going to help you not me and certainly not anyone else on this sub you say you get by in life by avoiding pain which is reasonable but if youre not going to at least take calculated risks then youre going to have a pretty unfulfilling life
GetMotivated,removed,i tried not to xkcd hosts their own images and this sub has a whitelist for approved image post links my original postwas autodeleted hence xkcd in title
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,you already know taking that year off would fuck you hell why a whole year if you need time off take off the summer semester if you already take summers off just buckle down man
GetMotivated,removed,twice in my life ive left a job before having a new one lined up first time i was recklessly endangered there and decided my safety was more important second time my relentless prick of a boss basically accused me of doing something illegal and i basically to him to go fuck himself that was a hard time i drained my savings account for months while trying to find something my advice at least find a part time job that you can support yourself off of for a few months while you look for something better youll technically be employed which is good and youll have some income this is what saved me the first time around i said fuck it and picked up hours at my part time job and survived until i found something else
GetMotivated,removed,downvoted because op and you dont know what youre talking about
GetMotivated,removed,then continue working at your shitty job with long hours doesnt matter to me or anyone else on this sub if this is the attitude you carry around with you i can see why this is the only job you could find
GetMotivated,removed,and that is the attitude that made a wonderful person commit suicide
GetMotivated,removed,idk what tribunal is but maybe if youre doing it with foresight you can make it work out ive done the unemployment benefits thing it made it harder to get a job afterwards ideally i should have gotten fired in a way where they couldnt give me a bad reference after the fact i figured out how i could have done it basically by calling them on various laws they were violating but idk if i could have actually executed it without losing my temper and bitching these idiots out which is what i got fired for
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,tick tock good luck
GetMotivated,removed,quotas a biometric scanner time clock strict antiphone policy building has no cellular signal on the inside and all internet trafficphonecalls are recorded and heavily monitored oh and the hours extend just past the normal operating hours of most businesses not saying its impossible just difficult
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,you mean the excuses column
GetMotivated,removed,nah thats manager talk do things so theyre as convenient for me as possible theres simply no other way you eventually learn thats not strictly true and worse trying to have that attitude gets you nowhere when it gets you nowhere that will conveniently be your fault too even if you jumped through every hoop on the list turns out you dont play golf with the right people and sorry pal you were never really management material anyway now scram were shipping your job to the phillippines the problem with jobs is that theyre a lot like bad exes sure its nice if you get a new one lined up first but jobs tend to soak up all the energy time autonomy and focus that really needs like a nasty relationship the important part is ending it since it cant take you anywhere but bad if you cant do it the right way just get it done jobs and managers are frenemies at best if not the shareholders sue till they are its probably much better advice to you know get that fuck off fund built up properly as pf would say months expenses then youve taken your power back and that changes a lot
GetMotivated,removed,downvoted because op did link the comic but it was removed because this sub only allows imagr links

GetMotivated,removed,thats a nice comment mr or mrs ifuckjuicypussies
GetMotivated,removed,ugh i dont want shitposts
GetMotivated,removed,if it relates to gaining or losing a little bit everyday then hes simply stating something that is patently obvious and we all know anyway i hate to break it to you but youre in rgetmotivated this sub is all about repackaging the same basic ideas that everyone already knows if you clicked on the image expecting some groundbreaking new mathematical theorem then idk what to tell you
GetMotivated,removed,hey i dont mean to be an assbut do me a favor and say what youre trying to say in different terms either we are made of the same mold and thats cool or you think i am something im not lol just give me the short non sarcastic version of your post the knob is hitting me back a bit tonight sorry
GetMotivated,removed,well fuck you too i just need help now
GetMotivated,removed,i may not agree with the sentiment in this post but shit if it helps even one person become less lazymore hard working great or do you like to go into every sub you dont like and remind its users of why its a shit sub
GetMotivated,removed,i cant tell if youre trolling or just really confused great start of a discussion right there the post is about giving effort not gaining more seriously where do you get that info from open up ms paint circle the pixels where you got that info d also according to your logic the guy in day is putting in effort not hes not fuck damn it i know you guys are trolling i mean you keep twisting my words slash claiming im talking about effort but just understand that it might not be about giving a but about making a growth in learning per day so be an adult and dont misuse my logic filling in your faulty assumptions lets make this simple lets say you want to learn a language and go to live in that country knowing only one word thanks is a good start in any language how weird would it be to have a vocabulary of more than words after one year not weird at all right
GetMotivated,removed,trying to put your effort into a percentage is total bullshit anyway let alone anything over effort but its not about effort and you seem much more like a troll saying i wouldnt know what a percent is
GetMotivated,removed,shitty excuses are simply tumours for the future
GetMotivated,removed,eh there have been a lot of these incredibly trite things there should be days where this sub has nothing posted or at least voted up but its like people need to have a quota its amazing how if you took many of the things on inspirational backgrounds or written on store clapboards or chalkboards and simply put them in text it would look stupid
GetMotivated,removed,oh but both scare the shit out of me
GetMotivated,removed,have you been a twat your whole life as well

GetMotivated,removed,this thing is bursting with seaman
GetMotivated,removed,people who write this mental shite are cock wastes
GetMotivated,removed,i literally came here just to see if someone posted this for those who dont know is where the idea came from
GetMotivated,removed,i actually find this motivating but apparently this sub is now rgetcynical so something something negative
GetMotivated,removed,why does the bird have to have a gender sexist
GetMotivated,removed,thanks gonna jump off a building tomorrow thanks rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,yup freak accidents happen do you think those birds would be happier if they instead just remained ignorant to the fact they could fly
GetMotivated,removed,well if attempting to degrade people trying to help themselves and eachother is what gets you off suit yourself maybe we need more strict moderation if this is where the problem is stemming from to me though it seems its more a case of bitter people projecting insecurities those people need help too but maybe they should start in rdepression were the ones looking past the anger stage and actually trying to rgetmotivated i dont really see why being a default sub allows us to be a target low effort content is not really justification to feel victimised
GetMotivated,removed,rnocontext
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is shit
GetMotivated,removed,actually only of combat checks not all skills checks pedant
GetMotivated,removed,then what exactly is your problem what exactly are you calling bullshit on were literally a bunch of guys trying to get motivated why would anyone feel the need to come on here and post unmotivating crap in the comment section if theyre not either just a blatant asshole or blatantly bitter at life they often go hand in hand no that would not be ideal because the more people exposed the better it would be ideal if people would stop inundating literally every post with negative crap im fine with discussion i simply take issue with the fact that every single post on this sub always has a bunch of negative naysayers dominating the comment section its not a very motivating environment for people who have issues with getting motivated
GetMotivated,removed,yeah but the problem is that literally every single post in this sub is always some guh complainjng that the metaphor sucks and doesnt motivate them thats really not what this sub is meant to be about
GetMotivated,removed,wow this sub will seriously upvote anything
GetMotivated,removed,rgetmotivated is ironically probably the most depressing subreddit meager attempts at motivation are somehow more discouraging than the halfhearted courtesies of an indifferent stranger its sortve like wow this motivational post is so bad i feel like i should just stay in bed for a week to teach it a lesson or believe in myself fuck you dont tell me what to do go fuck yourself be polite fuck you be polite
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,funny how this sub is rgetmotivated but the highest upvoted comment completely unmotivated me
GetMotivated,removed,thats because the bird has fucking wings if the branch breaks whats the bird gonna do hes just gonna fly away if my fat ass was on a branch and it broke what am i going to do except fuck on my ass because guess what i dont got fucking wings
GetMotivated,removed,to be honest i should just filter this sub i dont think ive ever seen a single actually insightful thing come from here
GetMotivated,removed,are the people who make these images trolling its the only explanation the people who upvote them maybe also or bots or just not really looking at them i guess some of them seem profound or motivating but only if not thought about for more than the briefest moment a drunk driver believes in himself and his ability to drive overriding his intoxication a bird does not believe in itself in any meaningful way not does it have a mechanism that we know of to worry about the potential for a branch breaking though presumably it does have some way of assessing the support offered by given branches that said bird nests and the eggs or chicks within are frequently destroyed by having been built in locations not stable enough so theres that
GetMotivated,removed,your argument is that throughout natural history no branch has ever broken while a bird has been sitting on it jeez man either just admit youre wrong or simply stop replying its a bit pathetic
GetMotivated,removed,yeah and pc virgin neckbeard race are also plebs
GetMotivated,removed,god this sub makes me want to die i thought it was an excellent thought but apparently redditors disagree out of all sub this one is the most contrarian its sickening
GetMotivated,removed,its only relevant if you find it relevant you make it sound like this sub is called rgetlaboinkurmommotivated
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is for plebs ill allow it
GetMotivated,removed,is it just me or is this subreddit a giant circlejerk of people posting motivational quotes just to be dissected and made useless in the comments shits depressing man
GetMotivated,removed,im considering it as a personal battle against the toxic negative crap which is overunning this sub
GetMotivated,removed,so dumb its monday fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,yeah this is not motivating if this sub is gonna have any point you cant just put words up and go this is motivating if thats the case bump this to the top life is short achieve your goals live long and be happy dont let anyone bad tell you something you dont want to hear fight on
GetMotivated,removed,what a nice coincidence i was feeling down a few hours ago so i started browsing this sub for a bit i somehow ended up on rgetdisciplined and decided to check out the top threads while i was at it i found the thread you linked read it and ive been feeling much better today thanks to that your comic makes me even more eager to try out this method

GetMotivated,removed,and i love your user name
GetMotivated,removed,so youre chalking up one of the richest men in the worlds success to he was born into a family with money seems a little ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,you wanna be at the top gotta suck my peepee
GetMotivated,removed,what about the families who have nothing is it morally right of you to hold million in a bank account while they barely have enough money for a meal
GetMotivated,removed,the only advice this guy should be giving out is to be born the son of a congressman its alot easier to be a fortune builder when youre born into wealth and have daddys connections as opposed to a peasant that came from the bottom most of the people on here who want to get rich who are the sons and daughters of lower or working class workers should be taking advice from engineers doctors mathematicians because those are tangible careers that can take you from lower class to upper middle you cant go from the bottom to the top in one generation it takes generations if youre lower class youre never going to make it to anything close to warren buffet standards period train to be a professional in a demanding and well compensation career give your kid an amazing education and head start in life then maybe it can land an upper class job if its lucky like a top banker a cfo of a company or something then your grandkid might be able to reach warren buffet standards if hes a financial genius and incredibly lucky ignore this shitheads quote it means nothing and it wont make your rich the difference between successful people doctors engineers bankers lawyers and really successful people billionaire investors is that successful people were born to lower to upper middle class parents and really successful people were born to middle to upper class parents
GetMotivated,removed,so you are just going to let people starve when you have a shit ton of money that could be used to improve the lives of hundreds if anything you are the immoral one you are willing to let hundreds of people to live shitty lives so that you can buy expensive champagne and yachts
GetMotivated,removed,if i were to have functioning cars air conditioned homes and toilets then yes it would be immoral
GetMotivated,removed,only if you think i dont want the somalians to have a better life or that im working towards helping them i recognize that they have a worse life if i were to give away my things i would be homeless if i were to give away my money i wouldnt be able to feed myself i dont live in wealth if thats what you think
GetMotivated,removed,im going to say no to this sub by unsubscribing

GetMotivated,removed,fuck you and your self indulgent post you think youre better than everyone because you show off what its like to be really living while implicitly judging everyone who lives differently i hope you fall off that fucking mountain got piece of human garbage
GetMotivated,removed,cool rationalisation
GetMotivated,removed,ok but this sub is get motivated not whinge about people who are
GetMotivated,removed,this is a follow up to this post which was pretty well received i had requests for more detail on the specifics of how i turned my life around so this post will focus on the strategies and tactics i used first i want to clarify im not hiking the at to help with depression or anything im hiking because its what i want to do im hiking because im finally not held back by fears im hiking because im finally living after years and years of hiding in my room i see this hike as a capstone on over a decade of self improvement very briefly ill recount my pastmy other post has more detail i grew up as an anxious and depressed chinese kid i was adopted from china at and my father died when i was this created a lot of problems that took me many many years to come to grips with as a consequence i went through cyclical depression and anxiety for my teens and most of my twentiesim now ive had serious suicidal ideation and many points in life where i felt i couldnt possibly continue on despite it all i was able to push through and apply these practices that slowly bit by bit changed my inner being and as a consequence changed my outer world through the years ive had many relapses where it felt like everything id learned and gained was lost but each time i fell i was able to come back a stronger wiser and with less fear cornerstone habits fitness changed my life i was going into highschool scrawny with zero confidence i asked for a weight set for christmas when i was and started doing random lifts benching a whopping curling dumbbells but i stuck with it and by the age of id built up to and body fat heres a old post i wrote up on rfitness talking about that transformation fitness gave me a sense of control over my life it gave me confidence it gave me the belief that i could accomplish anything that i set my mind to a belief that was completely foreign to my younger self without this confidence i would never have taken any of my actions later in life because i wouldnt have believed myself capable of achieving any of those goals so i think its vital to start the process of change with a cornerstone habit it doesnt have to be fitness but i think fitness makes a great one you can measure your progress it will make you feel better and improve your cognition youll receive external validation as you make progress and gain confidence and an improved self image i think meditation makes for another great cornerstone habit i recommend focusing on one simple habit and building your new life around it dont make it complicated start with a minute walk everyday focus only on this habit then after a month build upon it add pushups to the end of your walk then a minute meditation session and so on but not everything at once just build one simple habit that you dont skip no matter what a simple habit thats not overly complicated or difficult to maintain changing a life starts as one simple change which will build unstoppable momentum given time the mind is everything truly our attitudes and perceptions are everything you see it on the trail all the time two people can be hiking the same trail and have completely different experiences one is worried about what theyll do when they get home theyre worried about rain worried about the upcoming mountains the other is enjoying the sunshine theyre lookimg forward to cooking a warm dinner theyre happy that they get to spend a few months in nature same trail same hike two totally different experiences because of their attitudes because of their perceptions when im depressed i think of how unfair it was that i had to leave everyone i knew at the age of how much easier life would be if i didnt grow up being so screwed up psychologically from my early childhood experiences if i had a normal family if i connected with my parents like most of my friends but i cant change the past i can only change my attitude and reactions today and its when i take responsibility for my attitude that i can fight the darkness i can look at my childhood as a curse or a gift i know im much stronger mentally and emotionally today because of my early life experiences all my many periods of depression has forged an inner core of strength that others dont have im much more resilient for the experiences so i can choose to wallow in self pity or i can choose to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to me and make the best of it and that is powerful we all have an incredible core of power within us to claim it we need to have the courage to stop being a victim to claim full responsibility over our life to see our tribulations as a trial by fire we are only victims of life if we allow ourselves to be victims you can be great its there within you let go of the selfpitying narrative its only a story choose a new path choose the path of life choose to accept what happened in your past as a inevitable and necessary stepping stone to becoming the fully actualized and fully vibrant human being that you know youre meant to be and this change happens again with the smallest steps it happens by choosing on a daily basis on an hourly basis to change your attitudes and beliefs day after day its hard work youve had years and decades of negative thoughts they wont go away in a day or even a year but they can and will be changed with perseverance everything you need to know has been written about by someone else i started the path reading a tony robbins book now i think the guy is kinda cheesy and long winded but at the time his book helped a lot i dont have many specifics to recommend everyone is different you will find your own authors who speak to you but i firmly believe that once you set an intent to find the books and people that you need that they will them materialize in your life almost as if by magic so open yourself to learning seek out authors seek out audio books open yourself to learning everything youre struggling with someone else has overcome and theyve written books and given talks that will help you achieve similar outcomes get a handle on your addictions until you master your addictions you cannot master yourself for me my big addictions were video games porn and caffeine mastering these was less a matter of actively trying to suppress them than a process of filling my life with more positive activities heres a video i made talking about getting off caffeine and my marker for positivenegative is simply what makes me fulfilled and happy at the end of the day for me video games porn and stimulants gave me a temporary boost but always left me empty and depressed at the end of the day and as ive removed the addictions with things like meditation exercise building my business hiking the at socializing being with my girlfriend i end the days happy and fulfilled and it depends on how youre approaching a thing when i used games as a tool to escape life they left me unfulfilled and unhappy now i play hearthstone a few hours a week for fun and its great again it comes down to attitude and perspective so thats my simple yardstick i get rid of that which leaves me empty and add that which makes me fulfilled change in the end is actually very simple it really is focus on positive habits add to them when you inevitably fall then start back small and build again try new things i try everything i come across crazy stuff astral projection lucid dreaming chakra crap most of it is bs and not useful but there are some really helpful nuggets that i never would have found if i hadnt tried ive read a bunch of really useless self help books but most have had at least one tiny piece of useful info and thus werent a waste of time like bruce lee said absorb what is useful discard what is useless and add what is specifically your own in the end what gives me peace is that all we need to do is try given a long enough time horizon improvement always happens if you try so dont stress just try do what you can if what you can means taking a shower and walking around your house awesome thats all it takes now do that again tomorrow and soon youll build unstoppable momentum it truly is amazing ive hiked about miles now and have about to go heres some photos from mainejust finished hiking maine now on to the white mountains httpsimgurcomgallerysdujg goodluck everyone and happy trails im posting photo updates on ig if you want to follow the journey wwwinstagramcomjackjoneshg
GetMotivated,removed,great job shitting on peoples hobbies meanwhile your accomplishment results in nothing so you went on a long hike you didnt improve anyone elses lives you didnt contribute anything to anyone else all you did was look down on other people
GetMotivated,removed,well i already have a blog that ive written on for four years and i already make money online and i already have a yt channel with subs so what you really think im trying to pull some bait and switch here that im trying to lure people in with some sort of look at me im just a fellow redditor gimmick and then spam everyone with affiliate links because like you said i openly linked all my social in the op because thats what youre implying that my post is written specifically with the intent of somehow scamming people down the road seems to me ive been as transparent as i can with not hiding the fact that i make money online i wrote about it in the op i wrote about it in one of the top comments please let me know where im deceiving snyone forcing anyone to read something they dont want to or to spend money that they dont want to spend
GetMotivated,removed,and this kids is why we have a major mental health crisis going on around the world because ignorant people believe that many mental health issues can be fixed naturally i guess people with type diabetes can also naturally regulate their blood sugar and people with defective heart valves just need to work out so that valve can get strong and repair itself there are so many diseases out there where the body cant regulate something correctly and as a result it requires either surgery or medication to help correct the issue yet many like you dont believe depression is one of them this is despite the number of medical studies and research done over the last years that have explained this all very clearly
GetMotivated,removed,your coffee vid is quite the bullshit you are acting like you were on dope cant get anything done because of cups of coffee or no cups its not some mind numbing or overreaction drug thats not the caffine thats your brain believe me i drank cups before and kept going i quit because of stomach problems and i miss it a lot my energy was not effected at all by this its a lot more likely that you got your energy from more exercise and telling how to kick caffine addiction by some mumbojumbo pseudo scientific quota come on man just dont give people excuses if you want or need to quit caffine just do it i get that this all your opinions and you just wanna help but you do not need to make a challenge or a sickness out of everything its not an addiction its a habit
GetMotivated,removed,any excellent post that every sjw on the planet should contemplate the victimhood complex is all about perception these days
GetMotivated,removed,yes i read it and anti depressants are probably the worst option if you are depressed are you kidding me like seriously i cant tell if you are joking yeah give a depressed kid a pill with a side effect of suicidal thoughts lol what a joke you obviously have no fucking clue what you are talking about i think you were on that mountain for too long and i dont think you read what i wrote like i said if youre depressed just cause you are depressed and you have no real reason you just feel sad all the time then yeah working out and eating healthy is definitely how you can get rid of those sad feelings but also like i said thats pretty pathetic if thats your idea of real depression oh im just sad because im sad vs actually having a reason for you depression you and i are talking a bout two completely different conditions youre talking about chemical imbalance im talking about real fucking depression the shit that cant be solved by bulking up and posting daily douchey instagram photos of your abs
GetMotivated,removed,yeah cause real depression is cured at the gym get the fuck out of here you pretentious prick
GetMotivated,removed,i stated a fact wasnt even racial bait go ahead and post some proof that im wrong
GetMotivated,removed,well now youre a douchebag also not everybody has the money to do these things and barely has free time trying to make ends meet asshole
GetMotivated,removed,check out the song avalanche by bring me the horizon its all about his struggles with adhd growing up most of my friends had it and i thought it was cool it was funny and an excuse to get some awesome meds that made your brain amped up now i know i was ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,this sounds a lot like me its something ive always been working on but a lot of times i feel like im making no progressa really incredible opportunity fell into my lap about months ago and i do feel like im squandering something amazing with my inability to remember things and focus i use an extensive calendar along with alerts and postit notes to keep myself on track but for everyone else it just seems so easy between school work and my own side jobs i end up working hour days and i just cant focus for that long continuously
GetMotivated,removed,im i started noticing this a few years ago its extremely hard for me to concentrate on a task or even focus on a conversation with a person if it doesnt interest me i also have difficulty holding eye contact after a while i just zone out of a conversation ive dropped out of college once before and almost dropped out again last year im giving it a last chance and i love my degree but sometimes i just think maybe i wasnt made for the academic life since its so hard to bring myself to actually do somethingl like i can actually have or whole free days to work on a project or an exam and i will find literally every way possibly to zone out from it including cleaning my room cleaning the kitchen etc it just doesnt feel like procrastination it sometimes feels much more of a urge i dont have control myself on the other side if i get something that interests me i will breathe and live that and nothing else like literally skip sleep for that particular thing this mostly happens with new videogames but there have been a few college projects and personal hobbies ive felt that way the problem is that it feels very random and seasonal something ive completely dived myself into now might not feel that way in week or month ive tried meditation and exercise which a lot of people recommend and i definitely noticed some improvements but even meditation i find it extremely hard to do because my mind goes extremely wild and i cant zone out and be in the moment another problem is that its extremely improbable to be able to get a add or adhd diagnose in my country it doesnt work like the states and adderall for example is not even prescribed around here ive recently been trying since ive heard experiences about the wonders of it and its really early to tell specially because classes just started but i definitely feel an increased focus and peace of mind
GetMotivated,removed,thanks you fucking prick for shitting on my parents you have never meet ps they are both vets ill let them know how shitty of parents they were
GetMotivated,removed,this is completely false this is misinformation at its worst add has been shown to be to times more prevalent in alcoholics dont just go spouting nonsense about things you are completely ignorant of especially when it comes to medical diagnoses
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you dr mike aint nothing but a motherfucking pussy ass bitch dont know shit about what life is
GetMotivated,removed,ive had adhd my whole life and ive finally discovered how probiotics can seriously not only ease my anxiety but its been proven that they help us not give up in the middle of seemingly insurmountable tasks just look to our science teachers poor little lab animals
GetMotivated,removed,yeah jump off a bridge you pussies
GetMotivated,removed,just rename this sub to rbecomeanhero already
GetMotivated,removed,also sack up and stop being a weanie free will use it or lose it
GetMotivated,removed,brb gonna go find tall bridge
GetMotivated,removed,rsanctionedsuicide
GetMotivated,removed,cause redditors like being pedantic and bitching about minutaie more than improving themselves
GetMotivated,removed,do it kill yourself you know you want to
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,do most users here take the advice literally the message is pretty obvious to me face your fears and exit your comfort zone or youll never improve my life as improved fold after living by this which is why when uwellitsbouttime bitched eh this is bad advice pretty much across the board i got a little annoyed
GetMotivated,removed,half of all the poor choices ive made in life were based entirely on following this philosophy i will never understand this sub
GetMotivated,removed,watch this then again and again in a few weeks the change wasnt overnight for me but it started something and for the first time in my life i feel like i might be going somewhere its ridiculous but after years of depression it was honestly a revelation to me that you have to force yourself to do stuff i thought one day the depression will disappear and magically ill just feel like doing everything that needs to be done like everyone else surely does lol
GetMotivated,removed,also this and check out a website called unfuck your habitat its for people who want to regain control over the mess around them but have trouble being consistent really it all boils doen to getting the fuck up and doing stuff motivation is fleeting you need to make a habit of just doing it slap yourself and get up
GetMotivated,removed,youre an ass
GetMotivated,removed,this post made me unsubscribe from this subreddit
GetMotivated,removed,she should vote for trump if she really wants va corruption to end like him or hate him hes onto it and can sort things out hes even looking to incentive identification of money leaks by giving one time bonuses to those who uncover errors in accounting
GetMotivated,removed,you really need to educate yourself about reverse racism in this country all blacks can do is be pissed off and curse you out may be kick your ass but whites have the resources to institute racism and cut us off at the knees and at every path we dont have the power to do that you think racism is just believing that one race is better than another it is way more complicated than that so when we become the elite and create laws that make it difficult for you to obtain the basic things in life and then exercise the power to influence the world on how inferior and yet dangerous we believe you are then you can call it reverse racism when i can shoot you while you are unarmed handcuffed and on the ground under my foot and keep my job and all the benefits then you can cry reverse racism
GetMotivated,removed,just another bitter failure trying to bring everyone else down with him fuck off back to bruh
GetMotivated,removed,this sub produces more cringeworthy nonsense than twoxchromosomes
GetMotivated,removed,this quote is bullshit and this sub is cancer anonymous
GetMotivated,removed,hey fuck you carpenter is a good job
GetMotivated,removed,maybe they would have asked for workers rights too
GetMotivated,removed,thats why mr ford asked the people he tried asking horses and they wanted bigger dicks
GetMotivated,removed,it doesnt surprise me that henry the nazis seem ok to me ford had enough ego to pretend that he invented the automobile
GetMotivated,removed,i had no idea i wanted pokemon go so much
GetMotivated,removed,can we not relate everything to pokemon go
GetMotivated,removed,obviously he also means nintendo letting others make it its still legal that way
GetMotivated,removed,jews are evil also henry ford
GetMotivated,removed,can we please stop posting this he never even said it im fine with most reposts but this is tiring
GetMotivated,removed,its a franchise this is how franchises operate like call of duty or any other franchised game nintendos name is on it because they own the ip therefore it was built to nintendos specifications for ensuring their ip is properly protected and used
GetMotivated,removed,done
GetMotivated,removed,and if you ask henry what he wanted hed say no jews

GetMotivated,removed,the same guy who would send hitler for his birthday nice choice
GetMotivated,removed,thats how you get downvoted give a snarky remark that isnt even smart hahaha
GetMotivated,removed,kill all the jews henry ford
GetMotivated,removed,heil hitler
GetMotivated,removed,if i had asked people what they wanted theyd have said not to be in a concentration camp not that i care henry ford
GetMotivated,removed,oh boy lets not go down the road of henry ford quotes this is a slippery slope ahem nazi
GetMotivated,removed,henry ford didnt say this and he didnt invent the car
GetMotivated,removed,i think hitler kicks ass henry ford
GetMotivated,removed,more chilling is the httpwwwjewishvirtuallibraryorgjsourcejudaismnaziexphtml when speaking to an accomplishment of an individual or group it is perfectly reasonable to include context of who how and why that accomplishment came to be neither stands alone
GetMotivated,removed,how is this motivational also he didnt say that
GetMotivated,removed,the problem is that what youre saying admitting he was a dickhead is usually not how the conversation goes down usually it goes like this person steve jobs was a massive jackass person but he invented computer this means he was a good guy person first of all he did not invent computer secondly nohe was a jackass person i cant believe how jealous you are mr jobs was a geniusgoodperson and he did invent computer person i am starting to become jealous of how he doesnt have to live on this fucking planet full of idiots any longer

GetMotivated,removed,daniel radcliffe dropped out of high school i thought going to school was a requirement for underage actors in the uk as per child labour laws and whatnot
GetMotivated,removed,this article basically says he didnt say the exact phrase but he probably thought it fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,i bet you were so happy when you saw this on the front page your adrenaline started pumping knowing how cool and smart you were going to look by being the first to tell the masses this great and wonderful truth you have that you literally remember only for the purpose of being able to shriek out he never said that like a pre teen girl every time you get a chance now youre wondering how i hit the nail on the head how did i know exactly what went through your mind when you saw this because im a hunter i hunt people like you with your below average iq and your pathetic thirst to have someone anyone think that youre intelligent for just seconds in your mind youre literally screaming please please think i know a lot please and im here to tell you you lowest common denominator dunce you are not smart you never will be youll never ever comprehend anything that of people dont already know remember that you ignorant piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,it motivates me
GetMotivated,removed,murdering nazi sympathizer
GetMotivated,removed,whats with the weird cult of people attributing things to henry ford that are inaccurate theres enough salacious shit that is accurate like how he was a nazi sympathizing antisemitic piece of shit and before anyone posts that other piece of stupid about him starting the work day or living wagethats also incorrect viciously so
GetMotivated,removed,idk about that but he created a new currency as the old one was worth almost nothing this coincidently got rid of all german dept related to the mark and international bankers lost a lot of money ironically this actually led to a ban on german goods by jews around the world then he created national parks healthcare the autobahn and other pretty forward thinking improvements though idk how much of an effect this really had on the economy
GetMotivated,removed,it also doesnt seem to be very motivation related this sub is just quotes on pictures and its very sad
GetMotivated,removed,he didnt say this but he did say any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black henry ford great guy s
GetMotivated,removed,first of all let me mention that i will get to the vegetarianism thing but i want to address something else first his antisemitism has little to nothing to do with his impact on history i have a problem with this in fact it encapsulates the whole problem i have with your sentiments on this whole ford thing often when this kind of discussion comes up theres this bizarre idea that people on my side of the argument are somehow wanting to deny fords impact on history as an entrepreneur andor inventorindustrialistwhatever im not understanding that he was a villainous jackass does not erase any of the facts surrounding his connection to industrial progress i just advocate that we append his historical dossier to state that he was an important industrial figure and entrepreneur and a villainous racist what exactly is the problem with that its simply a recognition of the entire set of facts now if you have some kind of emotional desire to make ford into a demagogue and it puts a bad taste in your mouth to have to talk about him in the context of him being fundamentally a shitty person then we have a pretty much irreconcilable disagreement as for the point about vegetarianism i concede that it might seem awkward if we assume that people years from now would be looking at all meateating people and judging them in the same way that a who just became vegan judges his or her parents for continuing to go to arbys however i still maintain that the overarching moral philosophy that underpins the future societys vegetarianism will likely be identical to our own and that which henry ford operated under in the future people may decide to eschew meateating especially if we have labgrown meat or whateverbut if they do so it will be because they adhere more strictly to the same basic morals that we operate under not because they have invented some new morality in other words we will be fair game for their judgement in the same way that ford is fair game for our judgement also for whatever its worth you guessed my political affiliation like senator sanders i identify as a democratic socialist tldr the moral compass shifting is not the same thing as the whole basis of morality changing and im a goddamned bleedingheart liberal lol
GetMotivated,removed,fake quote from a racist asshole
GetMotivated,removed,tell that to the idiotic prime minister who left the brexit decision to the idiotic prejudiced pensioners of middle england
GetMotivated,removed,the best inventions are the things that people dont even know they want
GetMotivated,removed,it kinda gives me the creeps that you think calling someone out as the hyperracist he factually was is a witchhunt exactly why does he deserve sympathy for being a rampant antisemite and seriously since when is it unnecessary to vilify someone for being an actual bigot im sorry to veer off from my earlier academic tone but it just bugs me that people love this guy so much that they can find a way to excuse him literally serving as an inspiration of racist ideals to adolf hitler himself
GetMotivated,removed,oh i absolutely agree with you on that i think the comment that basically said dont take away from his achievements just because he was racist was a bit absurd i can recognize that ford was a visionary but he was a horrible racist so was teddy roosevelt as well a man i actually respect in many ways but im also fiercely critical of the problem that the professor highlighted in the class that day was that using modern concepts of morality can be dangerous pits to fall in since they can be used to weaken an otherwise good thesisargument
GetMotivated,removed,ford was particularly racist for his time and there were fairly wide scale boycotts of his cars because his newspaper advocated violence against jews he wasnt just a product of his time a good deal people thought he was a shitty person then too obviously if he openly espoused those views today his business would be immediately fucked but they definitely still at least damaged business back then

GetMotivated,removed,it is an insult otherwise people wouldnt be called autists do you thini autistic people like to be autistic of course not

GetMotivated,removed,its false assurance coming from a media personality who doesnt know you its as false as the idea of unconditional love for everybodyif you love everybody no matter what they do all that does is devalue love earning praise and respect is harder and less comforting but its real well all these kids who grew up watching mr rogers grew up perfectly fine really because no generation before this one needed safe spaces or trigger warnings
GetMotivated,removed,mr rogers is the king of mpmd nobody can deny that
GetMotivated,removed,pretty pathetic honestly especially for this sub isnt the point of this sub to get motivated duh and change the way you are if you were truly happy with how you are you wouldnt be here trying to get motivation to change yourself

GetMotivated,removed,judging by the posts in this thread yes this is one of the most useless pictures ive ever seen in my life theres more words in this picture than there is in a fucking text book theres reason to have ever turned this into a picture when people look at a picture for information they are wanting something that can be quickly consumed and easily understood this does not do either of those things this shouldve been left in book form thats why every single post making a joke about how long it would take to figure this piece of shit picture out is so highly upvoted its useless

GetMotivated,removed,thiught it was weeks fuck you mrs bitch face
GetMotivated,removed,i looked this up since i wanted more info and found that you posted it days ago also so im reading those comments instead
GetMotivated,removed,sounds rough bet you could use a drink or two or three or ninety
GetMotivated,removed,if you read the links uqref linked to youll find this was authentic information from a plastic surgeon in the who noticed patients took a minimum of days to adjust to their new face or missing limbs others extrapolated this to mean new habits in days the kernel of what youre calling harmful is authentic information choosing temporary motivation instead of a habit of discipline likely propogates more harm than good
GetMotivated,removed,and that was a huge piece of shit not a good example tbh

GetMotivated,removed,is it so hard to believe that someones gotten into satanism or are you that much of a housebred nerd who never goes outside and hasnt experienced enough in life it gets way deeper than anything ive said
GetMotivated,removed,as a spiritual person i find this to be very offensive can you please remove it or make a comic that does not show a child with the devil what the fuck dude smh
GetMotivated,removed,i cringe when people use the book of job as an example of gods love and how one should be faithful to him a loving god wouldve just told satan to fuck off and not fucked up a guys life over a pathetic wager instead we have yahweh going oh a dick measuring contest where the fuck do i sign up satan
GetMotivated,removed,no need to be so frustrated as to make bold promise of never want to work for anybody else again i always remember hemingways saying always do sober what you said youd do drunk that will teach you to keep your mouth shut working for others is great way to learn true its hard finding the right job with people wholl help you improve but as youve already learned everything worthwhile in life is hard so dont make jump harder than it needs to be uber driving sounds cool try it and be informed that so even them may dump you in few years selling on ebay harder than it sounds too much competition something else if i was you i would go with this look for something within your career field something you already have expertise with and remember the best time to look for the job is when you already have job good luck and if you want me to expand reply

GetMotivated,removed,i have it worse so your struggle is irrelevant fuck you
GetMotivated,removed,i have no other way to say this youre going to have to literally kill yourself to get rid of that other person youve been holding on to
GetMotivated,removed,finally something better on this sub than a quote a year old would think is deep and post to facebook
GetMotivated,removed,if random people everyday are telling u to kill yourself then maybe it should phase you do u wipe ru an asshole y they doin that
GetMotivated,removed,this sounds like the kind of shit some frumpy year old woman puts on facebook when theyre bitching about their haters

GetMotivated,removed,because this person is clearly old af
GetMotivated,removed,what a load of shit
GetMotivated,removed,exactly the same thing posted here a few weeks ago can we at least get motivated enough to post something a little bit original
GetMotivated,removed,thats just how it works a common question i ask when people say they have a hard time getting motivated i ask what theyre trying to getting motivated for and why a lot of times they dont have anything well its no wonder they have a hard time getting out of bed why bother take the time to set some goals the worksheets i use are in httpswwwredditcomrgetmotivatedwiki
GetMotivated,removed,dont tell me to smile apparently it is sexist nowadays
GetMotivated,removed,was this sub created in irony because it seems to only attract the most cynical pessimistic people in the world
GetMotivated,removed,the rule just says smile why are you even on this sub
GetMotivated,removed,but thats not the point man if you werent being so obtuse and cynical youd understand but i realize now that this sub is ironic its for the most cynical and pessimistic people out there fuck me
GetMotivated,removed,this is amazing awesome post im gonna repost in rawakened because they need to hear this
GetMotivated,removed,im sick of all the cheesy ass wanna be inspirational quotes in the world if you depend on this shot for motivation just give up you clearly dont have what it takes to do whatever it is your trying to do i want to see more de motivational quotes quotes that make the quitters quit and the winners go fuck you yes i can
GetMotivated,removed,that all depends on what you believe some guys take my statement seriously i happen to be sarcastic there
GetMotivated,removed,isnt sarcasm out of line by definition anyway if this sub were more about motivation and less about performative maleness wed have fewer guards up against selfaffirmation it has its uses especially if youve treated yourself like a loser all your life

GetMotivated,removed,probably not
GetMotivated,removed,hey look another dumb nigger that runs after a ball for money i suppose its either that or go back to killing each other
GetMotivated,removed,youre absolutely naive if you think his deal with nike got him success and if you think his financial gains is what hes defining as success he worked harder at his craft than nearly everyone else to get as good as he did doing what he loved he persisted through the inevitable road blocks and the countless failures he would face on the road to get that good he worked for the skill he attained yeah the money that comes is nice you have to make a living but the reason nike even approached him in the first place was because of his renown in his craft he didnt get approached by nike and then thrown into the nba because he was associated with them he worked harder than his peers and got better than his peers he got recognized for it and opportunity like the nike deal presented itself so to sit there and think yeah hes talking primarily about financial gain and his deal with nike is insultingly ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,my cock tried all best vaginas herein visit them now
GetMotivated,removed,micheal jordan is an asshole so fuck anything he says
GetMotivated,removed,what type of bullshit advice is this if youre even considering doing something shady to get what you want even if you have nothing remember this the ones with everything are just waiting for another excuse to keep people like you from surviving op you need to clarify before some dumbfuck views this as an excuse to act invincible and resort to crime
GetMotivated,removed,it makes you not ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,theres your moral compass for the world culture right there your strong because youll do anything it takes alot of people without money stop right there they will not do anything it takes they have a moral compass thats why theyll will survive and you will perish in hell
GetMotivated,removed,as much as i love this quote ive been in that situation before and one cannot think logically when at the brink of suicide its often a symptom of clinical depression a mental illness it warps your entire world view and way of thinking you start to think that you are doing people a favour by killing yourself you have no energy to go on adventures because even getting up from the bed and taking a shower feels too difficult the worst is the loss of motivation of creativity of all the things that made you the unique person you are you literally feel soulless and dead nothing gives you joy you feel like a burden on your loved ones and friends you feel that you do not deserve joy that is why people commit suicide
GetMotivated,removed,annonlinkqiit sluts for free fuck at this point
GetMotivated,removed,oh fuck you i was scrolling peacefully here

GetMotivated,removed,look at his comment history lol spamming that shirt over whole reddit just reeks of insecurity
GetMotivated,removed,lol how about you kys
GetMotivated,removed,this is the straw that broke the camels back on this sub for me
GetMotivated,removed,sounds like you have a piss poor attitude and according to its symptoms its untreatable the following are causes of ppa shit head bosses crappy parents backstabbing friends and if youre hating everyone you defiantly have ppa
GetMotivated,removed,and a hammer would fuck them both up so you know it totally is about the circumstances i swear this sub is full of bullshit analogies
GetMotivated,removed,this post made me unsub to this subreddit
GetMotivated,removed,so eggs are better than potatoes thats racist

GetMotivated,removed,rcirclejerk is leaking
GetMotivated,removed,wow just cause they are black they can do whatever i dont think so
GetMotivated,removed,i do this every day from when i wake up to when i finally manage to go to sleep i ask myself why do you hate the world why do you hate being around people why why why and then i realize the world is full of stupid people who would rather believe in a book of fiction than science i realize that most people are stupid ignorant douchebags who would rather think about themselves before others and it makes me sad and depressed until i fall asleep yup works like a charm
GetMotivated,removed,reposts for days front page already
GetMotivated,removed,of course he had to throw the race card in there thats the only negative part in my opinion race doesnt exist in a kids mind adults make racism come to life
GetMotivated,removed,they had me til the blood of jesus bit
GetMotivated,removed,coming on pretty strong with the god stuff there
GetMotivated,removed,lmfao please video you going there you know this is a black israelite group you think you will be welcomed
GetMotivated,removed,cant really take someone who teaches a board punch very seriously
GetMotivated,removed,i am not black but maybe this might explain it to you let me also say that in europe many immigrants are treated like this its partly what drives the rage to allow recruitment into terrorist cells
GetMotivated,removed,black people are treated in the us how immigrants are in the uk
GetMotivated,removed,why all the gendered talk though why cant it be as a person and not as a man
GetMotivated,removed,no shit we all have our struggles but youre an idiot to think a white man doesnt have it easier than a black man the kid will face these subtle differences eventually might as well bring it up early
GetMotivated,removed,there are parts of this country that are still segregated not officially but just by how people have chosen to live the irony is that there are even efforts from the black communities for segregation now see all the black safe spaces on campuses and the like you made no implication of the sort but racism does indeed go both ways
GetMotivated,removed,seems to blame fathers heavily no mention of mothers and since many many criminals come from fatherless home its important to hold mothers accountable for not encouraging their boys to express their emotions
GetMotivated,removed,your educated lol everything you posted us bullshit poor people are opressed in america not just black people jews have white guilt too
GetMotivated,removed,i am european and have never been to the states so i cant even pretend to know the truth racial tension and discrimination is a legitimate thing bruh to the point that some people might adopt white names to not appear foreign its bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,i thought it was good until he had to bring race into it
GetMotivated,removed,canadian
GetMotivated,removed,also dont forget the racism in the black community
GetMotivated,removed,you realise this is just so they can imprint their own specific cultish brand of religion onto children right dont trust these snakes
GetMotivated,removed,it didnt take long for race to be brought up
GetMotivated,removed,what we are still segregated because half of the country even more i believe but are afraid to admit it dont support blm because we think there is a problem in the black communities we live in the most free country in the world if you assume that the south is racist and segregated you have other issues you need to deal with first
GetMotivated,removed,and this isnt called racism because
GetMotivated,removed,what is not wrong with it it makes the lesson religious which is unnessary and problematic
GetMotivated,removed,is it genuinely hard to be a black man in america or is it hard to be a black man in parts of america or is that just a belief system of some black people have you ever heard of the term racism maybe google it its quite interestingdepressing if you know about racism ask yourself a question is it hard to be a person that is treated racistly as opposed to a person that is not treated racistly ever
GetMotivated,removed,the fact of the matter is that of the professions you listed black americans are generally gravely underrepresented doctors lawyers movie iconsweve only nominated one black man for president while black americans are significantly overrepresented in the lowereconomic class court system and jails not trying to insult you but if you are going to be a criminal defense attorney you might want to take some extra classes in statistics the africanamerican population is about so ofcourse there are less africanamerican doctors lawyers scientists etc this seems so painstakingly obvious to me but still people are using this argument as if they are oppressed to me there is no racism only if you make it out to be i have alot of friends from alot of different cultures and ethnicities and i dont even see them as blackbluegreenpink i just see them as humans
GetMotivated,removed,what a racist comment being a man takes mental fortitude even for white men ive said it before and ill say it again black people are the racists all they see is color
GetMotivated,removed,i was all about it until he started going in on the race angle that advice is good for everyone black white or whatever in between no need to taint it by making it inherently racial to some kid
GetMotivated,removed,i was all into it until he said being a black man in this country reminded me of the shop scene in die hard this is bad you should all feel bad hes brainwashing him to be a victim because of the color of his skin this is not what you should be teaching kids fucking pathetic
GetMotivated,removed,thats all very nice and stuff but too bad about that jesus bullshit
GetMotivated,removed,and anyway just as random experience
GetMotivated,removed,sorry i read your lines and got points black are not smart enough to defend themself probably black have no enough money to finance to buy an expensive attorney which will give you a white slate from your posting i see no racial profiling just the individual stupidy and that cannot be the result of the black in prison problem
GetMotivated,removed,youre also ignoring asian history aboriginal australian history and a boatload of other cultures that have been way more expansive than african that we ignore because we are pandering to make up for years of racism its called white guilt and so many of you have it way too much
GetMotivated,removed,the world doesnt need more reposters though
GetMotivated,removed,you mean blacks need more mentors like this if black lives matter why do black dads scatter
GetMotivated,removed,that has black hebrew israelite written all over it look it up yourself
GetMotivated,removed,to be fair he put more importance on mental strength than anything else
GetMotivated,removed,it seems really positive and good but is this only for blacks
GetMotivated,removed,a warrior of god what
GetMotivated,removed,i guess im bothered by the use of black and men why does it have to be those two why not race and gender neutral
GetMotivated,removed,this is actually what you dont need you dont need to tell black kids that they need to be stronger because theyre black
GetMotivated,removed,ignorance is bliss or in your case its seething anger
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off blacks are fucking professional victims these days i never knew they was so weak pathetic and selfish
GetMotivated,removed,stfu im on mobile
GetMotivated,removed,grab your pitchforks everyone someone mentioned god so everything they say is shit now

GetMotivated,removed,argumenting lel
GetMotivated,removed,being a black man in this country oh gawd go ahead and downvote but i think teaching people to punch things while associating the pain and hardship with their race is racist
GetMotivated,removed,not motivational not even a metaphor really just common sense trying to masquerade as something positive so many of these lately hey you only die in a burning car if you continue to sit in it well done on the easy quote that means jack shit
GetMotivated,removed,i cant take anything in this sub seriously that doesnt have correct punctuation

GetMotivated,removed,do you walk around looking for a blue or red pill no then perhaps the matrix theory is not high in your credibility level thermodynamics dont support your theory at all strange you think the opposite the eternity of the universe would have consumed all the available energy by now free will is important dont let the electrons on your head tell you otherwise or were you forced to type here tyrants what superior law are you using to call the current laws not always right so you would simply take eating babies as right then you cant complain about anything do you really believe what you say or are you just trolling hard to believe you complain about ideas but would not bat an eye for a baby but theres the abortion stuff so maybe you are not trolling if you condemn a culture because it conflicts with your opinion then it robs you of any authority in your judgment its as arguing if blue or green is the most beautiful color again i doubt you really believe that your opinion carries no weight if outnumbered do you not appeal to concepts of right or wrong when you protest youve done it here note you use the law to punish psychopaths but by your own words you are wrong punishing them if they made the laws also that people act different dont prove that morality doesnt exist on the contrary the fact that you expect some to stop behaving wrongly to the point you call them psychopaths proves morality exists people not behaving morally actually proves free will i have no problem with your counterarguments i just find odd you divorce from reality in them i wonder why go to such extremes just to try to get rid of the idea of god volition
GetMotivated,removed,dont worry when people have nothing to contribute to the discussion and have no good reply for you they just say youre an alt account to make themselves feel better about being wrong
GetMotivated,removed,yeah i dont think thats how those squirrels died
GetMotivated,removed,haha this sub is so predictable the top comment is always someone taking the meme completely fucking literally and thereby concluding that it is not good advice all of these motivational memes are meant to convey a truth not give black and white advice
GetMotivated,removed,theres so many dumb things coming out of this sub i know a good quote sounds fine to many but stop and consider the content once in a while
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,pretty immature post tbh considering the fact that some people who read in this subreddit actually are depressed immature rethorics by trolls dunno really what to do with this message either it doesnt really make much sense perhaps its though
GetMotivated,removed,people with actual paralysis the hallmark of it is that they cannot just pick fucking ignorant
GetMotivated,removed,do you practice at being a total twat or is it a natural thing
GetMotivated,removed,i dont come here for honesty i come here for false hope
GetMotivated,removed,i think what it means is that people who want to commit suicide always have a good reason but that doesnt mean you need to
GetMotivated,removed,someones gotta repost this to
GetMotivated,removed,yeah after hours at the office browsing reddit is whats holding me back browsing reddit reminds me of humanity connects me to the world and makes me feel like all of those hours were worth it browsing reddit gives me stamina inspires me to help my fellow man and shows me the capacity of human beings ulooseimpediment go fuck yourself you are a demotivator
GetMotivated,removed,but but im pooping right now
GetMotivated,removed,rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,removed,its not reddits fault im lazy
GetMotivated,removed,another passive aggressive snark fest

GetMotivated,removed,enough with these spammingreposting powerusers seriously
GetMotivated,removed,wasnt this guy and extreme islamist who was a hard core racist and believed in segregation yes he was those are historical facts yet this will be downvoted
GetMotivated,removed,you gotta cup the balls dont just let em dangle there all cold and lonely caress em let them know you care about them too
GetMotivated,removed,altruism along with egalitarianism both core principles vehemently rejected by us republicans
GetMotivated,removed,there
GetMotivated,removed,itt a lot of salty motherfuckers
GetMotivated,removed,reminded of how much of an ignorant brute he was yeah he did such a good job at punching people int he ring that people will ignore the facts that he was a child molester abusive husband an illiterate muslim who advocated segregation and a massive racist and scumbag all around but hey he was really good at punching people in the face and right now its popular to let black athletes like oj simpson and ali do whatever they want without repercussions
GetMotivated,removed,no this is not what the epitome of reddit has become do you know what ive actually seen a lot on reddit ive seen a lot of trolling from individuals who get upset when people dont share their same views you think im a closed minded person for not opening up to your view but im not i know ali was no saint people do bad things people do good things whats the purpose of me hitting your link you want me to hate someone that i put in high regards why ali has passed let him rest in peace what does that say about you i expressed myself and my feelings on someone who i thought had a positive impact on me you know what the epitome of reddit is to me imho the epitome of reddit is the freedom the express yourself let me be life is about mistakes im the type of person who want to remember people for their good qualities and not their bad
GetMotivated,removed,mehdi hasan said its irony that the most loved american man is a black guy named muhammad
GetMotivated,removed,who cares one way or the other what he had to say im sorry man but that is so ignorantly laughable that i cant help but lmao at your insane level of ignorance look up man look at the thread title it is promoting ali as a philosopher and human rights advocate not a boxer in response to a post noting that the claim is total bullshit you say eh he was just a boxer im ok with acknowledging that his black silverback gorilla rage and hate against all other races helped him win this is not controversial because ali himself said this was the key to his violence and thats cool but here we are seeing op post some bs that ali is a human rights advocate for humanity thats not true the dude was a violent racist psychopath and that is what drove his career it was his energy his inspiration this latest tact to claim he was a great human rights advocate is the biggest load of shit thats ever been posted on the internet why the heck would you be here promoting it as well what is your deal valeriejarret
GetMotivated,removed,and thats not what he was famous for i just think its funny that people are circle jerking over inspirational quotes by a man that was most famous for being violent you cant say that the point of boxing isnt violence
GetMotivated,removed,get motivated in an interview with playboy he declared a black man should be killed if hes messing with a white woman when the interviewer asked about black women crossing the colour barrier ali responded then she dies kill her too
GetMotivated,removed,dont bother dude with the exception of ali dodging the draft everything that poster said is unsubstantiated trash all based on an hour long youtube documentary by a known propagandist
GetMotivated,removed,coming from a guy who beat the fuck out of people for a living
GetMotivated,removed,namedropping a dead person for upvotes classy
GetMotivated,removed,i dont get all the support for an avowed racist
GetMotivated,removed,i like to finish on a girls face seatedharlequin
GetMotivated,removed,racist islamist scum good riddance
GetMotivated,removed,how about this one for ya all jews and gentiles are devilsblacks are no devilseverything black people doing wrong comes from the white people—drinking smoking prostitution homosexuality stealing gambling—it all comes from the white people — interview with david
GetMotivated,removed,all jews and gentiles are devilsblacks are no devilseverything black people doing wrong comes from the white people—drinking smoking prostitution homosexuality stealing gambling—it all comes from the white people — interview with david frost the world should be reminded that ali was a racist pos
GetMotivated,removed,you mean this one all jews and gentiles are devilsblacks are no devilseverything black people doing wrong comes from the white people—drinking smoking prostitution homosexuality stealing gambling—it all comes from the white people — interview with david frost
GetMotivated,removed,dodge that draft muhammad alluh akbar ali
GetMotivated,removed,and racist to boot
GetMotivated,removed,just the general dislike of white people as well i mean sure i understand when someone is against the systemic negative effects on black communities but extrapolating that towards an entire race is a bit insane in my mind of course what could my middle eastern ass know people are trigger happy on my previous comment cause they reckon im a redneck racist i guess
GetMotivated,removed,i like how the media and people completely ignore some of his other quotes especially the ones concerning racemixing and black identity
GetMotivated,removed,i thought it was the insane amount of taxes i pay every year now i have to help others too pour me another bartender
GetMotivated,removed,yet another great quotation ruined with a hyphendash embrace the em dash everyone
GetMotivated,removed,pay someone to stab a cow in the neck let it suffer after you take it kids away for meat but butterflies though
GetMotivated,removed,he was one of the biggest racist of the and early he had hatred to the point of rage for anyone not black or not muslim now were suppose to feel as if we lost a great philosopherlol see ya
GetMotivated,removed,this from a moron who allowed himself to be punched into retardation the idiot was a drooling pile of mush
GetMotivated,removed,exactly how did muhammad ali server others other than himself
GetMotivated,removed,sorry but why is this motivational i have to serve others to live on earth umm ok
GetMotivated,removed,he was obviously a fake muslim if hes going to print these although im going with the obvious and saying he had nothing to do with this quote at all should have been move like a butterfly explode like my family
GetMotivated,removed,fk u
GetMotivated,removed,people who think they owed america their lives in vietnam were stupid
GetMotivated,removed,literally censorship fascist mods
GetMotivated,removed,i think this kinda answers your questions as to why hes so revered
GetMotivated,removed,i liked the butterfly
GetMotivated,removed,didnt go to jail the boxing sanctioning bodies banned him for years though
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think anybody on earth apart from hard line militarists and racists think ali should have gone to jail for the draft youre most likely being trolled he stood up for what he believed in and thats highly admirable he has said quite a few offensive things he grew up with jim crow laws but most people that hes touched is as an athlete
GetMotivated,removed,dont be an asshole
GetMotivated,removed,way to motivate the people with no hope of ever being motivational
GetMotivated,removed,god youre a short minded ignorant fool
GetMotivated,removed,with good reason
GetMotivated,removed,get at me bich
GetMotivated,removed,what a bad moderator comment
GetMotivated,removed,i liked how he was a racist black supremacist and his ideas were considered a service
GetMotivated,removed,sorry dad we will only be nice and positive then do we get ice cream
GetMotivated,removed,this comment isnt motivating its quite the opposite im here for motivation but this comment makes me feel less motivated
GetMotivated,removed,great quote lets ignore that he was a bigoted racial supremacist
GetMotivated,removed,suck my zipper chump
GetMotivated,removed,this is a fucking stupid post
GetMotivated,removed,so dissenting opinion will be removed so that you all can have a hugbox from now on good to know
GetMotivated,removed,trying to decide whos more of an asshole you or the one who made u mod
GetMotivated,removed,says the dude that dodged the draft lol
GetMotivated,removed,because as we all know everyone can find great motivation in the death of the childhood icon
GetMotivated,removed,that is so free internet of you
GetMotivated,removed,fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,look at his username this guy is a troll
GetMotivated,removed,if youd been alive when he was in his prime maybe id give a fuck about your sophomoric edginess but you werent you could live years and never possess of that mans grace and elegance you knuckledragging neckbeard go wank on some other grave
GetMotivated,removed,im so happy that even after being a racist draft dodger people are able to celebrate the life of a man who has died as if he were a hero i love america
GetMotivated,removed,how do people think muhammad ali was a good person fuck me for speaking the truth but he was a fucking asshole to frazier and an open racist
GetMotivated,removed,except he had an iq of like and was deemed unfit to serve because of it the first time around in the draft
GetMotivated,removed,like that somehow excuses all of the grandstanding on racial purity or anti kafir propaganda ali was an amazing fighter and a victim of political swine that used him to further their agenda that is the truth of cassius clay
GetMotivated,removed,why the fuck would anyone hate a white person today for something people did years ago it makes no fucking sense
GetMotivated,removed,dude was racist as fuck fuck him
GetMotivated,removed,memes
GetMotivated,removed,nope
GetMotivated,removed,yes he was a racist prick
GetMotivated,removed,i dont mean to be a buzz kille or anything i know the man just died and he was a legend and i respect that butdid he really do much good which the millions he had he always kind of seems like an asshole loser who was good at hitting people i really mean that in the least prick way a prick thing can be said there are people who actually help people and animals everyday
GetMotivated,removed,so many comments here are off topic get over yourself
GetMotivated,removed,you too can be a racist muslim but i repeat myself
GetMotivated,removed,justifying what he did as loving his country is completely ignorant keep drinking the koolaid
GetMotivated,removed,tldr if you absolutely refuse to read this wall of text or to seek therapy buy its an over the counter httpsenwikipediaorgwikiselectiveserotoninreuptakeinhibitor that has comparable effects to its prescription counterparts with less of the side effects please make sure it doesnt conflict with your current medslife style theres all these posts on here about techniques and shit to become motivateddisciplined but really i wanna know why the fuck you guys even want to in the first place idk guys help me its simple this sub is for normal people trying to better their lives they come here to see a quick witty post to give them that buff toward their goal notice i say normal people it may as well be in a foreign language none of it makes sense or applies to you but for real theres people out there who all get out of bed every morning whys it so fucking hard for me you may think well if i just explained my views better i could convince someone to see the world for what it really is look its so obvious why do you do what you do there is no meaning you will die there is no greater meaning to it all the world is pain followed by pain until death your lineage and legacy have no purpose or meaning everything you associate value to was simply made up and taught by those who came before you since the world is suffering its better to not live at all try it i dare you the other person hear and understand what you are saying but will whole heartedly disagree why because they dont feel that way you feel that way because you have a chemical imbalance in your brain literally its a physical disability a lack of proper wiring you are broken drill this into your head you have a fractured shin you dont just walk that shit off you see a doctor and find a way to fix it think back to a time when you gave a fuck really try to think about why you did what you did is it because there was some promise of grandeur come on you did what you did because it was fun in that moment it was purely enjoyable sex is fun drinking is fun social events are fun it wasnt all for some promise of a perfect future you did it because it felt good you may even think well ive experienced all these things so now theyve just lost their novelty and the world is boring and meaningless to me now this is wrong too we all know that old guy still doing the same old thing for years he goes about his seemingly mediocre life but hes always grinning with a glitter in his eye about the world he tells the same jokes to everyone and enjoys the small things in life experience is not the issue it is entirely perspective i can keep going why do cats and dogs do what they do what drives them why do birds fly south its all programming you are programmed to have sensations urges and motivation by nature i dont know your full diagnosis but its likely one of these apply to you httpsenwikipediaorgwikimajordepressivedisorder pddhttpsenwikipediaorgwikidysthymia it doesnt sound like any particular life event caused how you feel in fact you may feel even feel worse knowing that youre sulkingemotionless over nothing consider this since you dont seem like much of a religious type ill be frank you exist because your ancestors were able to survive long enough to get to the point of reproduction thats all that matters they could die at doesnt matter they reproduced therefore here you are you could have been a genetic ticking time bomb you hit your expiration date and now your brain will never be able to function happily ever again without aid of course thats where modern medicine comes in think about this for a minute the current evolution of mankind has been on earth for years at any point the consciousness you call your self could have come to fruition and yet here you are born during a time with amazing medical breakthroughs to top it off you live in a wealthy enough part of the world to seek help how fucking lucky is that man just think about it you literally won the lottery of life assuming this all makes sense to you since youre depressed you still think so what and thats exactly why youre broken sort of but like i said i dont even really want to get better everythings just as purposeless with or without depression youre wrong friend the existance of life is purposeless and without meaning life itself has meaning the purpose in a living organisms life is to feed the httpsenwikipediaorgwikirewardsystem life in your perceived reality has no purpose thats the depression talking purpose can only be defined in your own brain millions of organisms do what they do because their brain dictates it and rewards it properly youve been deprived of this reward system for so long that youve forgotten why to live in the first place the real cruelty of depression is that it feeds itself off of your misery every failure is reinforcement that your current thinking is the truth the real reality every negative thought is ammo toward your meaningless life movement the one and only thing im going to ask of you is this get your broken ass up and seek help actually ill be more specific if you already have a therapist get with them now and seek treatment does your therapist suck find a better one if you dont care enough to do these things contact the person in your life who is willing to help you make them do all the heavy lifting it could be your dad your best friend whoever i need you to get in touch with a therapist and be open to medication if you can get on some medication that helps you see the purpose and happiness even for a brief moment you will have the willpower to go forward right now your willpower is probably exceptionally low and i get that you may see the task to recovery or seeking help as some overbearing task but i promise you that it is the biggest and hardest part once youve gotten a small grasp on the reality that normal people see it will all be alarmingly clear to you what must be done and willpower will not be an issue i hope this post finds you friend and best wishes to you
GetMotivated,removed,i dont think the good roosevelt would have been much proud of todays young americans with their safe spaces and other crap life is very serious business and the weaker people are the more indirect they act the impression one gets is that if one was to be truthful in todays america one would either be sued or assaulted what a degeneration once the land of the brave
GetMotivated,removed,talking as though teddy wasnt a racist
GetMotivated,removed,you frown on all forms of nationalism because you have been taught to im sure according to you race doesnt exist either and im sure you also believe that transgenderism is totally normal and natural and yeah we are all equal one human race voting for hillary too i suppose
GetMotivated,removed,so im supposed to give up on my dream and stumble and bumble my way onto something that im good at even though i might not like it you want me to give up on my dreams stephen hawkings youre taking everything i worked for motherfucker imma fight youre fucking ass
GetMotivated,removed,i dont watch fox newsor any television news for that matter why are you using long dead presidents in a hypothetical scenario this is reality and they did their jobs they cared about the country and wanted to progress it your hero is a corrupt criminal and should be in jail if you did that crap youd be locked up if you are going to vote for her or trump then you are a selfish person who cares about artificial political bandwagon pride bernie was a fashion trend that gave up and decided to endorse a crook instead of be a man and fight not physically for his chance to take that spot from her dumb shady out of touch ass grow up i dont buy in to democrat or republican or any liberalconservative leftright bumper stick bullshit thats just labels and that does is cause people to act like entitled asshats like you clearly just displayed i want the best person for the job or maybe best persons bill clinton did his job whether he was a donkey or an elephant i dont give a shit he did his job and progressed this country they took a man who did his job out of office for a stupid rule and because he lied about cheating on his wife something im sure no other person in politics has ever donethats sarcasm by the way because judging by that assumption based mislabeling dog shit you type out you assumed all these things about me and yet have no source or proof to back them up and im the one being accused by using out dated references to a manipulated masacre what a stupid juvenile comment to even type im an american and i have been for every fucking second of my years of life i know fact that in my existence i have only seen years where we a great prospering nation i dont need to take a history class because i live it every day i make my opinions based off everyday observations you read a book about american history written by people who were paid to i dont know a thing about you but the fact you are from new zealand trying to tell me how it is here youre a fucking self entitled idiot who relies on labels and bumper sticker worthy slogans i look at society an listen to the world around me you use fictionalized scenarios and like i said a fucking idiot
GetMotivated,removed,i realized something these dont work for you however they work for everyone around you ask your significant other or parents or close friends if they notice a difference when your on them and i bet they say yes i went off my mood stabilizers for a few weeks felt great before i told my wife i ha quit taking them i asked her how i have been for the last few weeks she said edgy and kind of an ass lol
GetMotivated,removed,im finally done with this sub in addition to becoming a fly trap for unmotivating quotes its also become a haven for generic platitudes you want to really get motivated get off your fucking asses and go do something do anything but dont come here looking for motivation
GetMotivated,removed,op needs to get motivated to come up with an original title for once all they do is copy and paste shit in here its pretty lazy for such a motivation based sub
GetMotivated,removed,too bad the only way to effectively lose weight is a low calorie diet fatass 👹
GetMotivated,removed,gonna be negative in my reddit comment surprising fat people are fat not because they lack exercise its cuz they eat like shit theres plenty of losers on the couch who are in relatively normal shape and in way better position to get swole cuz they eat a regular amount of calories and dont need to spend years just to get to a normalish weight being a fat bastard is about how much you eat so i recommend to all the fatties before going and possibly burning yourself out doing a lot of exercise try to control your portions if your fat ass just eats a caloric deficit you will lose weight without even trying and despite the bs its not at all unhealthy to do as long as you get enough vitamins and shit in your daily meals fruits vegs nuts meats will all give you plenty of nutrients and the calories your body needs to function will be derived from your fat reserves that isnt to say exercise is bad or something but youre a lot better off first developing the discipline to control your eating
GetMotivated,removed,why shouldnt it be i worked for it no loans from my dad i have trained dozens of others part of the reason this country is so fat is because people sit around and pat themselves on the back if you are heavier than you want to be you are failure if you want to succeed it takes more effort than most of us have in us either get where you want to be or shut the kill yourself
GetMotivated,removed,if should meet me in your hour idea kill me you will find that you cannot abraham lincoln
GetMotivated,removed,but you just said the most you ran is a marathon and your longest training run was a im gonna take a swing and say that youre a troll based on your username but if you arent then i doubt youre as in shape as you say
GetMotivated,removed,yeah buddy our obesity crisis was one cell phone app away from being taken care of those brave pokemon trainers
GetMotivated,removed,my border collie died of cancer around years ago it was a prolonged agonising experience for her and ill never forget how she wasted away before our eyes
GetMotivated,removed,the ways carpe diem has been perverted is pretty funny from just be aware and present in your actions to do what ever the fuck you want fuck the future yolo
GetMotivated,removed,this post made me lol thanks
GetMotivated,removed,thats because the majority of the people on reddit are pathetic losers to think that they only come to this sub to leave a comment that takes a shit on the post hillarious most of these people live in their sad lonely little worlds anybody who has a grasp on the real world knows that happiness is always there for you to take it the people here are the worst type of oxygen wasters constantly making excuses and being lame and useless if you ask me exactly the kind of people that t you have to ignore everybody has a choice and these people choose to be miserable losers you can be better than that ignore their horseshit be content with your life and keep getting better
GetMotivated,removed,ok buddy go back to being a pathetic loser just know that you have a choice and its just sad when i see someone choosing to be a useless piece of shit
GetMotivated,removed,listen buddy i cant force you to open your eyes so if you wanna stay the loser that you are suit yourself
GetMotivated,removed,i just half skimmed this you really grew up its been what four hours and youre still arguing the same point how in the fuck do you walk into the world you made it makes no sense
GetMotivated,removed,not if you want to garden this is fucking stupid if you want to grow shit in a garden its better to be a gardener than a warrior
GetMotivated,removed,especially with the image of the katana being used
GetMotivated,removed,theres a gigantic difference between training to be a warrior and getting a concealed carry license the correct comparison would be military not just some civilian with a gun
GetMotivated,removed,this is the most neck beard image thats ever been posted here
GetMotivated,removed,because all you think when you see a katana is lol what a neckbeard xd thats why
GetMotivated,removed,how is this even related to motivation is this sub seriously just quotes on pictures now
GetMotivated,removed,i read this in my head in a very racist old chineseman voice
GetMotivated,removed,as a neckbeard katana master these are words to live by
GetMotivated,removed,come on dude dont make fun of pedophiles they are already having a hard time fitting in
GetMotivated,removed,id rather fight soft as fuck american vs citizens from most other countries lets face it we rarely have any serious hardships canadians might be softer but they always seem to have great soldiers and they live in cold place italians english definitely the danes and swedes are soft as fuck which is sad considering they were vikings good thing we are rich and powerful
GetMotivated,removed,it should be banned guns are for home defense
GetMotivated,removed,holy neckbeard
GetMotivated,removed,no its not when i turned i had to take months of drivers education pass a written and practical test and wait another year to get a license to drive a car i already owned guns by then i dont have to take any tests to keep them like i do for my drivers license the issue isnt your prejudice against uneducated and ignorant people its your aversion to personal responsibility tens of millions of people carry guns every day and train themselves to be competent in their use
GetMotivated,removed,true guns are hard to find
GetMotivated,removed,i imagine i joking tho i do realize that our propensity for guns would make it scary for invaders barring that tho a fellow american is not scary at all
GetMotivated,removed,credit where its due ban all assault trucks
GetMotivated,removed,haha no shit
GetMotivated,removed,dont ever not be a warrior gardening is for pussies
GetMotivated,removed,for those who immigrate here legally they have every right to be proud i am a big proponent of it is not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country the only people i see tarnishing patriotism are self loathing haters who have an agenda the media is biased and paints patriotism in this light as do other groups you do not have to be ashamed you can be you and be patriotic are you a bigot are you ignorant no does that mean some might think you are because you are patriotic maybe but they are in the wrong for being judgmental
GetMotivated,removed,as i recall it was weapon ownership armsweapons and im pretty sure that certain weapons are restricted to have in the us by civilians eg nukes so couldnt banning guns fall under that after all you still have knives batons tasers
GetMotivated,removed,dude i havent had sex in over a year i dont even need condoms im a woman turns out trying to have sex with other women can be a process i understand men
GetMotivated,removed,travelling umbrella condom salesman
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,hey fuck you i am perfectly agreeable its your obvious inferiority and jealousy that cause wars
GetMotivated,removed,you mean i dont have to lose my soul after all we created this fallout doesnt mean that war or war preparedness is the answer fuck off
GetMotivated,removed,supporting milo if leslie cant handle constructive criticism the internets not for her side note the abuse wasnt even racism nowhere was milo even slightly racist
GetMotivated,removed,i like to browse this sub from time to time but havent lately since it seems to be images with mediocre quotes on the front page constantly then you go into the comments and its everyone criticizing what was said or why it wouldnt work its nice to see some actual good motivation on here thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,removed,merrychristmasbot bides its time
GetMotivated,removed,find best one boobs at this point
GetMotivated,removed,you wait here boobs call
GetMotivated,removed,hey ben i see youre new here so i just wanted to let you know taking things that were posted here last month and reposting them is bad mmmmkayyyyy
GetMotivated,removed,what a load of shit
GetMotivated,removed,or just jump into a volcano to appease the gods and be an hero forever instead of a fuckin nobody rippin off reddit content for points that dont mean shit ever
GetMotivated,removed,ironic when coke is full of sugars that make you a fatass
GetMotivated,removed,a lot of demotivating comments here wow this is a great mindset to have especially when learning something new be it art to running what i dont agree with is the is this really my best work which should instead be something along the lines of ill put more effort into it next time otherwise without finishing you can get into a loop of constantly fixing and never moving on ze frank has a great video on this
GetMotivated,removed,also sexist and homophobic
GetMotivated,removed,summery of comments fuck you fuck the internet fuck my life
GetMotivated,removed,bern
GetMotivated,removed,fatty
GetMotivated,removed,i totally see where harithku is coming from and for future reference im wondering if theyre correct or not wait why do we need an english major this is biology a woman could only be fucked once and get pregnant from that one fucking this sub is so hilarious sometimes
GetMotivated,removed,found the feminist
GetMotivated,removed,boy i consistently find this sub demotivating because of how fucking idiotic it is i would like to think that a positive outlook on life was not the trait of stupid people but this sub makes a strong case for it
GetMotivated,removed,thats the guy that fucked the wife time for every time she allowed her husband an attempt at spreading his seed probably the alphas seedling too congrats
GetMotivated,removed,my ex is currently in a pregnancy scare situation with many possible donors this motivates me to be incredibly passive aggressive
GetMotivated,removed,just more bullshit posted to this sub unbelievable how the mods here let this get to the front page
GetMotivated,removed,murica
GetMotivated,removed,no wonder i unsubscribed from this sub its the exact opposite of motivation
GetMotivated,removed,fuck you people in wheelchairs
GetMotivated,removed,there is one but access to it is given out randomly at birth
GetMotivated,removed,it was a simple observation you think i give a shit about a bad motivational quote somebody asked why a quote referencing pregnancy featured a man and i answered the fact that my answer addressed some sexism apparently riled you up
GetMotivated,removed,genes and being born into the right family can also help
GetMotivated,removed,its funny to me that every single post from this sub that gets to rall falls into a few distinct categories really really stupid advice situational examples of good things happening to people that would never apply to your average person fake stories you should be motivated to x because at some point in history a famous person was put down once by somebody when they wanted to y but hey look at them now theyre famous
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is really terrible
GetMotivated,removed,so should i go ahead and add success to the growing list of places i cant access in my wheelchair
GetMotivated,removed,unless your father gives you a small loan of a million dollars
GetMotivated,removed,i lived in an apartment complex and wed tape cardboard over the floor button and write things like lazy on it note no disabled people lived on that floor note sometimes wed label the floor button up only as some of these twats would stop the elevator so they could ride down fifteen feet note sometimes wed put encouraging notes like the stairs are good for you
GetMotivated,removed,if dad or mom owns the elevator why take the stairs
GetMotivated,removed,there is if youre rich
GetMotivated,removed,at least the stairs are faster than the slow ass
GetMotivated,removed,you also need to properly space your words
GetMotivated,removed,rkerning
GetMotivated,removed,unless you are born on the top floor
GetMotivated,removed,what if youre in a wheelchair
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,unless youre born into a filthy rich family
GetMotivated,removed,blaming anything past what family you end up being born into a filthy rich family
GetMotivated,removed,i know what font this is bebas i wish there was more spacing between the words
GetMotivated,removed,sorta related would have been funny if they listed the ladder instead of the stairs
GetMotivated,removed,id say a small loan of a million dollars counts as an elevator
GetMotivated,removed,yeah so i guess fuck you disabled people
GetMotivated,removed,what about people in wheelchairs
GetMotivated,removed,there is one its called being a trust fund baby
GetMotivated,removed,is in a wheelchair looks confused
GetMotivated,removed,unless your parents paid for your schooling
GetMotivated,removed,jk white privilege will hold the doors for you
GetMotivated,removed,unless youre donald drumpf
GetMotivated,removed,donald trump had a elevator a elevator made of gold
GetMotivated,removed,til dj khalids number is hes got the keys to the elevator to success
GetMotivated,removed,oh theres definitely an elevator but you need a special key to use it that key is called connections and you get them from being born in the right family to being having a shhht ton of money to buy influence
GetMotivated,removed,unless you have rich parents
GetMotivated,removed,elevator to successinherited fortune of course there are elevators you just need to be born into the right family or better yet marry the right family duh
GetMotivated,removed,oh theres plenty of space ive never seen a motivational poster with a forehead this big
GetMotivated,removed,there is an elevator its called being born rich
GetMotivated,removed,this person has clearly never won the lottery
GetMotivated,removed,might as well just say fuck you to cripples while youre at it
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,tell that to trust fund kids
GetMotivated,removed,this couldnt be any less true for hot chicks
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,well if i had a small loan of million dollars i could show you how to take the elevator
GetMotivated,removed,this is perfect for rkeming
GetMotivated,removed,paraphrase there is no such thing as privilege posted on a campus by a white kid with rich parents who paid for their full school ride and will give them a job in the family empire
GetMotivated,removed,in other words your life is on fire and to be successful you have to exit it these motivational posts are made by cynics in disguise
GetMotivated,removed,jesus if this is a typical getmotivated thread i can see why i dont visit
GetMotivated,removed,you can however be born on the right floor to begin with
GetMotivated,removed,nope born rich lol
GetMotivated,removed,there is an elevator to success and its called inheritance
GetMotivated,removed,not if you are poor it would seem
GetMotivated,removed,trump proves that that isnt true he received a small elevator of i strongly suspect that pretty much anybody with that much money and no morals can make a ton more money
GetMotivated,removed,well this makes everyone using a wheelchair feel fantastic
GetMotivated,removed,unless youre a white cishet male of course then its all right this way to free money sir
GetMotivated,removed,i am a bot and i want to make you happy again
GetMotivated,removed,im a self made man and all it took was a small loan of million from my father
GetMotivated,removed,unless you are born into a wealthy family
GetMotivated,removed,there is an elevator to success and its called birthright or money
GetMotivated,removed,ive been taking the stairs for years and i have yet to see any money from it downvoted
GetMotivated,removed,only if i had a small loan of a million dollars

GetMotivated,removed,obviously the entire post is a troll even though the post itself is literally talking about one single word the op definitely doesnt know what that words definitions are even though he posted one of them straight from merriamwebster s
GetMotivated,removed,in my own life ive found accomplishing anything large or meaningful quite difficult i procrastinated and i found different ways around the procrastination but then i would always tell myself well that way around procrastination works so i cant do that or else ill actually get something done i knew the way to make things easier to start is by making the first goal as small as possible for example if my goal is to empty my email inbox then i will trick myself by saying that my goal is only to login to my email then when im there i dont actually have to do anything but the truth is once im there its a lot easier to do something about all the emails i have to go through i have since figured out that my selfconfidence is largely a result of what i finish and what i dont do its another psychological trick but this time it helped me to overcome my procrastination because i can take things at my own pace if i have a goal to live on a tropical island im not going to feel bad about it because my goal right now is only to make the next in this way my confidence improves and i can do bigger and bigger things ive only recently found this sub so i thought i would start making some posts like this thanks for your comment

GetMotivated,removed,sigh i really wish i remembered not to click on anything from this sub a picture of an inane quotation over an unrelated successful human really demotivates me somehow he never said it its idiotic anyway everybody isnt exceptional at anything thats normally distributed unless you change your definition of exceptional which is fine but arguably pointless reminds me of a headline in a newspaper complaining that roughly half of all school pupils were below the national average in some ability i forget which also fish are really stupid

GetMotivated,removed,lasersword just sounds faggy even for nerd standards
GetMotivated,removed,i have to agree with you here how is this post all that different from one of this subs highest posts of all time the post jared leto wanted that coat so he got that coat are people just disapproving because hes famous or they dont like the coat or both or something else either way i can see the inspiration in this post and im a little surprised by how bitter some redditors seem to be about it
GetMotivated,removed,cant we apply what the fucking speech was about uniting fucking humanity or are we just going to circle jerk as to what video was better i was so hopeful for humanity until i started reading the comments maybe someone should edit this video and replace all the mentions of soldiers with redditers but use the music from gladiator then we can shit all over that missing the point of that video too
GetMotivated,removed,this one here actually works because ive noticed this myself much better then most of the other cliche repeating bullshit on this sub instead this post applies some logic
GetMotivated,removed,so should we send this quote to trump i think he needs it

GetMotivated,removed,as someone who gets overwhelmed and lost in their emotions due to anxiety and has been told many times just control them fuck this post it is one thing to say what to do it is another thing completely to understand how to do it its like saying just build a time travel machine and just stop all those traumatic things from happening in your life would if i could buddy i have to take psychiatric drugs i do cbt and i still get swept away with overwhelming feelings and i feel even worse when i fail and make people uncomfortable with my illness or people think youre faking to get out of thingsget your way the thing is if my malfunction is that my heart pounds and i breathe too quickly and leak salt water occasionally i am not a bad person for that and im not illogical either i am just a person who is sensitive and has had to cope with a lot
GetMotivated,removed,another gem from getmotivated i genuinely feel sorry for the people that get motivated by this drivel
GetMotivated,removed,oops im sorry i thought this was rgetmotivated didnt realize id wandered into rjustneckbeardthings

GetMotivated,removed,actually most of the western thought was thoroughly represented in the different hindu philosophical schools thousands of years before the time of christ in the century voltaire wrote i am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the ganges astronomy astrology metempsychosis etc it is very important to note that some years ago at the least pythagoras went from samos to the ganges to learn geometrybut he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the brahmins science not been long established in europe epistemology is called pramāṇa it is a key much debated field of study in hinduism since ancient times pramāṇa is a hindu theory of knowledge and discusses means by which human beings gain accurate knowledge the focus of pramāṇa is how correct knowledge can be acquired how one knows how one doesnt and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired ancient and medieval hindu texts identify six pramāṇas as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths pratyakṣa perception anumāṇa inference upamāṇa comparison and analogy arthāpatti postulation derivation from circumstances anupalabdi nonperception negativecognitive proof and śabda word testimony of past or present reliable experts each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality completeness confidence and possibility of error by each school the various schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge for example the cārvāka nāstika philosophy holds that only one perception is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge the samkhya school holds three are perception inference and testimony while the mīmāṃsā and advaita schools hold all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge āstika there are six āstika orthodox schools of thought each is called a darśana and each darśana accepts the vedas as authoritative and the premise that ātman soul eternal self exists the āstika schools are samkhya an atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter yoga a school emphasising meditation contemplation and liberation nyāya or logic explores sources of knowledge nyāya sūtras vaiśeṣika an empiricist school of atomism mīmāṃsā an antiascetic and antimysticist school of orthopraxy vedānta the last segment of knowledge in the vedas or jñānakāṇḍa vedānta came to be the dominant current of hinduism in the postmedieval period nāstika schools that do not accept the authority of the vedas are nāstika philosophies of which four nāstika heterodox schools are prominent cārvāka a materialism school that accepted free will exists ājīvika a materialism school that denied free will exists buddhism a philosophy that denies existence of ātman soul self and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of gautama buddha jainism a philosophy that accepts the existence of the ātman soul self and is based on the teachings and enlightenment of twentyfour teachers known as tirthankaras with rishabha as the first and mahavira as the twentyfourth
GetMotivated,removed,them there aint some halfbaked thoughts them there thoughts is buddhism tarnation ill be ya didnt know you were a practicin buddhist
GetMotivated,removed,i disagree that you can trace the choice to pursue the ego as a cause of the state of the world today you are fucking delusional donald trump is a candidate for president of the united states of america hitler thought he was the vanguard of a master race shortsighted sociopaths can and do manipulate the worlds economy for their own gain regardless of the wake of suffering they leave the founding fathers seceded from the crown to preserve the institution of slavery which the crown was seeking to eliminate from the colonies the bloodiest war in all of north american history was also fought to preserve chattel slavery etc etc etc wake the fuck up
GetMotivated,removed,in the kind of person who will keep asking myself why i feel the way i do over analyzing myself to the point that i dont even know what im feeling for sure i want to know why im feeling the way i do to find a solution to the problem so i can make it go away be careful with this asking yourself why youre feeling the way you do is okay but psychiatric help taught me you also have to accept the feelings you have its okay if something makes you feel bad insecure confused or whatever something probably happened to cause this and if youre constantly trying to deny those feelings its as if youre denying a part of yourself accepting the fact that you feel the way you do is a form of self acceptance too you have to accept these feelings are a part of you to fully understand them so you can recognize and change the situation which make you feel this way

GetMotivated,removed,i find it obnoxious there are hundreds of examples of these exact concepts relayed beautifully by masters throughout the ages in prose and poetry any of these would have done from the buddha to the gita to lao tsu but no someone had to make an anglicized hack job of an elegant concept and sell it for money in some shitty little feelgood philosophy while youre taking a shit book

GetMotivated,removed,sjws can learn from this
GetMotivated,removed,correct the concept atman brahman the personal self equals the omnipresent allcomprehending eternal self is definitely still largely an eastern concept i was just pointing out that many philosophical traditions that people assume originated in the west are actually ancient hindu philosophical schools that were discovered by the west during the year occupation of india by the british raj im not indian but i know better than to harbor the arrogance of the eurocentrist the greeks readily admitted that many of their philosophical traditions were of indian origin interesting quote from erwin schroedinger in itself the insight is not new the earliest records to my knowledge date back some years or more the recognition atman brahman the personal self equals the omnipresent allcomprehending eternal self was in indian thought considered far from being blasphemous to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world the striving of all the scholars of vedanta was after having learnt to pronounce with their lips really assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts again the mystics of many centuries independently yet in perfect harmony with each other somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas have described each of them the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase deus factus sum i have become god to western ideology the thought has remained a stranger in spite of those true lovers who as they look into each others eyes become aware that their thought and their joy are numerically one not merely similar or identical the i that is god as translated in quantum questions mystical writings of the worlds great physicists edited by ken wilber if science ends up suggesting that the universe is conditional and the laws of physics are not discrete i would then entertain the hypothesis that consciousness cannot also be discreet as in individual separate consciousnesses are an illusion the self a facade of brahman httpwwwscientificamericancomarticleisquantumrealityanalogafterall this is also a great article but behind a paywall cant find it for free anywhere
GetMotivated,removed,this should be sent to every sjw
GetMotivated,removed,thats arguably not true im not sure i agree with the statement that you are not fighting for yourself in the case of a cancer doctor arguably you are improving the chances that you yourself survive cancer in the case however unlikely that you contract it similarly you need not view the issue as helping others at all in a certain light you can choose to view this effort as providing an invaluable service which secures your place in the society and gains you goodwill which can be spent to acquire benefits or at least to shield against misfortune for example if you are the tireless oncologist and you suddenly contract you probably personally know a doctor who specializes in curingtreating that disease and who has a high enough opinion of you to go out of their way a little to take on your care in other words you dont fail to benefit from this situation another result of cultivating goodwill is that when you start to work too tirelessly and begin burning yourself out people who care about you will stop you and make you take the resttreatment you need to ensure your welfare again being altruistic is selfbeneficial
GetMotivated,removed,it was a good place to start the discussion since i gave you the benefit of the doubt thinking you may be a troll as opposed to being bad at math there is no pixel to circle because this logic how do you circle logic so according to your logic with the learning a new word say you know word in day one and on day you learn of that word because you are using a percentage of the previous word that means on day you gained of what you learnt on day which is of that same word assuming you can somehow learn of a word on day you learnt the same word about times an if you learn of the word from previous day on day you would only know of that word you knew on day one how does that make sense to you so i am pretty sure he isnt talking about gains because by having more skill or knowledge does not mean you will increase the speed at with you develop that skill do you see where you have gone wrong gaining a skill or some muscle on one day is independent of any other day so if you used the correct logic which is to learn word a day in days you would have learnt words multiplication you cant use elementary exponential growth on independent variables you need to learn some elementary math do you even math bro
GetMotivated,removed,what about jesus or some other diety that isnt real
GetMotivated,removed,its inorganic to handle emotional experiences with logic i disagree were capable of rational thought and logic is completely natural its a human characteristic in that we can assess the situation and react calmly without getting all butthurt if we dont want to people say stupid and mean shit all the time you dont need to get upset by it but dont try to constantly logic your way out of feeling things fuck that id probably offed myself long ago if i let my emotions rule my decisions screw that i pick my fights if i choose to get angry or hurt over something someone says its my own damned fault for letting them get to me id rather concentrate on letting my happy emotions rule over the negative ones
GetMotivated,removed,be stoic dont be an sjw luzr is what this means

GetMotivated,removed,circlejerk
GetMotivated,removed,i see that you have resorted to personal attacks instead of presenting facts or anything like a valid argument you are obviously not a clear thinker let alone a surgeon so your own holier than thou attitude is worthless and baseless you completely ignore the fact that dr ben carson is a religious extremist that has repeatedly violated the oath that he took to become a surgeon to first do no harm so your argument in favor of surgeon assisted suicide is invalid because that is not what surgeons are allowed to do its also illegal this is why dr kevorkian went to jail because its not only a violation of the hippocratic oath to help people commit suicide its against us law and the laws of most states this is partly why many of the procedures were done outside of the united states otherwise dr carson would be criminally liable as well as in violation of his oath you cannot point to a single technical procedure that was perfected because of these surgeries so give me a break there is no advancement in science with conjoined twins all that was learned is that it kills them thats it you didnt even know about the radical religious extremism that lead to the deaths of every single conjoined twin patient that dr carson ever had until i pointed it out to you you said that its just one article not realizing that there were many reports about dr carsons failures and aggressive radicalism you have dismissed facts as unimportant and you cannot deny that dr carson did it all to further his career so theres the proof of just how he rose up the ranks so quickly he lies about his many failures and his radical extremism and covers it up and hopes that everyone forgets about the dead bodies that he left in his wake this is not science that dr carson was involved in it was self aggrandizement at the expense of poor tortured souls who came to him to have a procedure done that violates a doctors oath he compromised his principles to science and morality and experimented on those who trusted him he played on their hopes when he knew full well that there was no hope of success based on his own writings how many deaths is enough to prove the concept dozens hundreds thousands i would ask you to point to one single success that dr carson had but you cannot because there are none you havent provided any facts or cited anything tangible the statistics about conjoined twins are the only facts that you have yet presented and yet it doesnt support dr ben carsons radical position quite the opposite conjoined twins happen today because of radical religious ideology or because of lack of resources we have technology today that can see this defect clearly and more long before birth being conjoined is a severe and profound defect that merciful humans should allow to die without pain because as we have seen from the statistics and from carsons own failures there is no hope of success here only death or a life of agony so abortion is the only real option left that spares conjoined twins the pain and suffering that you object to your snaky personal attacks have shown that you cannot think logically and rationally and that you are no one to lecture anyone about science or ethics and you have no idea what youre talking about i worked in a hospital and worked with and around a clinical setting and i have had close family members undergo surgery there are rules that dr ben carson has completely ignored and gone out of his way to circumvent that are relevant and you cannot dismiss them and you cannot say that dr carson is allowed to ignore them ben carson is a radical religious extremist who used his position to lure conjoined twins to their certain death after the first few failed procedures that went horribly wrong he should have stopped ethically and apologized to the families and the world for having mislead people about the chances for success he is not fit to lead and im thankful that the american people rejected his radical and reckless view of the world he is a dangerous man and im thankful that hes retired and rejected from holding office in my view he should have faced criminal charges except that he went overseas to avoid prosecution
GetMotivated,removed,think youre probably after thread has a couple of links to the and higher res versions and the artists watermark of the poster in the comments

GetMotivated,removed,dont pray at all do something that might actually work
GetMotivated,removed,if you have a difficult life you have no choice but to endure it
GetMotivated,removed,dont pray its not gonna do you any good by his reasoning praying is letting someone else determine the kind of life you will have some flying spaghetti monster instead go out and make it a good one and find that strength within yourself
GetMotivated,removed,yeaaaah you do you and ill do me
GetMotivated,removed,billionaire ruling elites just loving this quote work harder slave
GetMotivated,removed,ill be honest here an easy life is way more preferable

GetMotivated,removed,didnt jfk say this
GetMotivated,removed,ive already overcome aspirin
GetMotivated,removed,i have already endured a pretty difficult one i think that most people can endure some of the wildest hardships but that when we are faced with them we just leave innocent pieces of ourselves behind people suffer every day in ways far worse than i know but placed in that situation i would adapt but lose parts of myself water can take all forms but droplets get left behind with every change

GetMotivated,removed,this is dumb one praying and it sounds a bits like your are hoping for your life to be shitty exactly i suppose it only wishes for the strength to endure it but without measurement like proclaiming to have the strength to win a weight lifting contest but never entering at best unprovable and useless
GetMotivated,removed,i mean i dont have the strength and i dont pray so can i have an easy life now
GetMotivated,removed,nice quote but absolutely stupid and masochistic why would anyone wish to endure hardship and pain over a nice easy life you only get one life and there are no bonus points for being screwed over
GetMotivated,removed,heres my advice if you are unhappy with your life quit whining and do something about it figure out what will make you happy and do it
GetMotivated,removed,how profound
GetMotivated,removed,pray they use ky when you get fucked up the arse in life

GetMotivated,removed,am i the only one who thinks people are a little too obsessed with quotations from famous people ever since social media became a thing nearly everyone and their mother posts motivational quotes but i dont see them actually working on them are people more productive happier wiser prior to stumbling onto them look at justin bieber for years hes been posting deep quotes on twitter yet it had to take an actual dui and plummeting fandom to get his shit together
GetMotivated,removed,ive just seen of my facebook friends post this quote as their status haha assholes
GetMotivated,removed,if you dont like it go to russia homer simpson
GetMotivated,removed,well bruce got the short end of that stick huh
GetMotivated,removed,the young bruce lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment hrmm
GetMotivated,removed,honestly if prayers worked outside of making one feel better in the moment then we wouldnt be where were at in the world everyone would be rich there would be no violence no war etc people need to live life in the moment and embrace the world around them just my two cents though
GetMotivated,removed,bruce lee died at im sure hed rather have the easy life in retrospect also praying for strength is as useful as praying for food
GetMotivated,removed,kennedy
GetMotivated,removed,in the future i hope humans are genetically modified to be devoid of laziness
GetMotivated,removed,i mean this just sounds ridiculous
GetMotivated,removed,but first learn badass karate
GetMotivated,removed,umm no id still have preferred an easy life if you have an easy life you dont need to be strong enough to deal with a shitty one
GetMotivated,removed,i love how americans believe that their actors are wise and have a deep insight to the world because they are famous just because bruce lee was an amazing martial artist and was asian doesnt mean that he has a deep view into the human soul
GetMotivated,removed,ive been praying and aint nobody listening but myself round of agoraphobia its been over a year since ive left my neighborhood i hope and pray to be able to make it out the door but im faced with days like this afraid that people are going to come to my house because it is my birthday fuck this shit and whatever part of my brain that is holding on to said shit
GetMotivated,removed,this is shitty advice and funny since bruce lee died at its the kind of crap that comes from survivorship bias of course youd rather have an easy life theres no shame in comfort as long as youre happy with it this is the pablum you feed to people as you subject them so they feel like their struggle is virtuous reddit is a fucking joke sometimes boo down with the for having stuff we wan also dont forget that scars of survival are better than the indignity of privilege
GetMotivated,removed,do not pray

GetMotivated,removed,totally judging from your post history you totally werent trying to shit on capitalism and the luxury its afforded us and the rest of the world maybe instead of trying to shoe horn your political beliefs into every conversation you should actually talk about what you seem to think you were talking about you spent a sentence on the comparisons between happiness in our country and in others the rest was shitting on muh capitalism and acting like the majority of americans are unhappy go fuck yourself buddy
GetMotivated,removed,go fuck yourself
GetMotivated,removed,
GetMotivated,removed,this sub is the new rmeirl
GetMotivated,removed,it would definitely be enjoyable it would be so enjoyable that you would decide not to kill yourself but then from that day forward every burrito you had wouldnt taste as good because you werent planning on killing yourself afterwards you would spend the rest of your life trying to have as good of a burrito as the day you wanted to kill yourself until finally you decide to kill yourself just so you could have a good burrito but it wouldnt work because you werent really planning on killing yourself because you only really wanted a good burrito you would never actually kill yourself but you would spend the rest of your life miserable wishing you could have a burrito that was as good as the one you had the day you were going to kill yourself

GetMotivated,removed,this is stupid
GetMotivated,removed,httpwwwhotelorietcomydlv
GetMotivated,removed,because most posts are written under the implicit assumption that the exceptions dont exist including this one the actual question is how do you determine the best course of action in any given situation of course that question is actually extremely complex and if most people realize how difficult that kind of thing is to figure out this sub wouldnt exist
GetMotivated,removed,this is a comparison
GetMotivated,removed,yeah right lets all live in our happy illusion lets all be ignorant lets all be the turtle living forever in our shell

GetMotivated,removed,i did i see posts from this sub via rall all the time and i thought you ned flanders mother fuckers had finally snapped
GetMotivated,removed,this is not true for pedophiles
GetMotivated,removed,this its amazing how some people here are able to twist everything into something negative and proceed to shit on others for finding value in posts like this trolls got nothing else to do with their life than to spread their hate and cynicism on sites like this
GetMotivated,removed,i dont know if he meant it like that but you are correct men do commit suicide more than women
GetMotivated,removed,usually those people are just grandstanding themselves like the straight white guy who thinks hes cool repeating sjw phrases about the evils of straight white men somehow unware that hes going around telling people hes a straight white guy good post and i generally agree except i dont understand how the opening about sjws fits into the rest of it

GetMotivated,not_removed,dont know if this has been said already but suite in its entirety is available free from adobe they got tired of dealing with people downloading illegally so they just put it out for free its older but still works fine for the average user
GetMotivated,not_removed,and he can afford all that ink
GetMotivated,not_removed,atleast he didnt use paint
GetMotivated,not_removed,mspaint would have been cheaper than excel
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats excel for ya
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont they have piracy in japan
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a designer these are absolutely amazing especially considering how he made them regardless of how easy it is to get photoshop now this guy has something thats wildly unique to him thats something not everyone achieves with photoshop
GetMotivated,not_removed,this guy can do that shit while i sit on my loaded pc and can barely make a square in photoshop cc
GetMotivated,not_removed,you got to be shitting me
GetMotivated,not_removed,you want to impress me treat each cell like a pixel and color each to create a picture that looks like these
GetMotivated,not_removed,hes gonna go nuts when he discovers ms paint
GetMotivated,not_removed,this sounds like something my dad a cpa for years would do he designed his garden to scale in excel visually
GetMotivated,not_removed,i use keynote as my photoshop this excel into photoshop the shit the best post ever as of today
GetMotivated,not_removed,excel art is quite nice comes right after python and art

GetMotivated,not_removed,i get a forbidden trying to access the page
GetMotivated,not_removed,looks at ps icon on taskbar hangs head in shame i think ill go do some sudoku now
GetMotivated,not_removed,excel also cost a bomb
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyone who works in data entry and finance is getting their creative on
GetMotivated,not_removed,not surprised he is japanese everyone in japan uses excel for just about everything if you ever worked in an office here you would be amazed at how much that program is universal
GetMotivated,not_removed,this man puts me and all my pirated software to shame
GetMotivated,not_removed,has he never heard of the pirate bay
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know its definitely not okay
GetMotivated,not_removed,this blows me away but it just proves my dad right back when i wanted a video camera and gradea software he a professional photographer and graphic designer artist told me that if youre passionate then theres a way more importantly he always reminded me that regardless of your technology or tools youre the one that ultimately creates there tools just make it easier this coming from a guy that spent his years using actual film until he was forced over to digital
GetMotivated,not_removed,who in the world pays for photoshop hell i didnt even pay for the yosemite
GetMotivated,not_removed,just pirate it
GetMotivated,not_removed,arent there free old version of photoshop
GetMotivated,not_removed,nature uh finds a way
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone help him torrent it like the other of ps users
GetMotivated,not_removed,just use krita
GetMotivated,not_removed,we were designing a house for clients who were accountants they brought in an excel spreadsheet document that was a floor plan showing how they wanted the house laid out i was blown away by the detail and appearance of the document and had never imagined that excel could be used to create floor plans
GetMotivated,not_removed,really great work i cant even comprehend how you can do stuff like that in excel
GetMotivated,not_removed,but he could afford to print and frame them
GetMotivated,not_removed,just so you all know anyone can afford photoshop because is now free to own without license get it httpwwwadobecomukdownloadsotherdownloadshtml click on the link youll need to make an adobe account to get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,he should have just downloaded it
GetMotivated,not_removed,rdataisbeautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,i guess he never heard of torrents
GetMotivated,not_removed,so thankful i know how to pirate software lmao
GetMotivated,not_removed,piratebay man get with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,a man needs to learn how to torrent
GetMotivated,not_removed,the hero we need but dont deserve
GetMotivated,not_removed,did reddit break the host
GetMotivated,not_removed,how did you get that snapshot
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you thought it was my machine and wow this art is amazing i cant even fathom how this was done
GetMotivated,not_removed,hug of death
GetMotivated,not_removed,remindme hours
GetMotivated,not_removed,fantastic my checkbook needs some reality distortion
GetMotivated,not_removed,laugh all you want but somewhere out there a programmer is reading this comment thinking challenge accepted
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can easily do it with your own hands the trick is to make sure the center of gravity is right in the middle
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,is that a switcheroo
GetMotivated,not_removed,is balancing your cheque book really a thing in america or is it just a cliche like programming a vcr
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats a checkbook
GetMotivated,not_removed,if he can figure out art in excel then he can figure out how to download photoshop free lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,same boat cpa and i am now in finance and i hate it
GetMotivated,not_removed,that doesnt sound like fun how do you even go about that
GetMotivated,not_removed,do do they use it for porn
GetMotivated,not_removed,do they use it to text each other httpiimgurcomhpcfaudjpg
GetMotivated,not_removed,must be paradise no wonder the japanese got their shit together
GetMotivated,not_removed,i use excel for way too much at my job in the process of teaching myself access
GetMotivated,not_removed,you fucking sales guys think you can use power point to do everything
GetMotivated,not_removed,so true ive worked on editing too many translations where each sentence or clause was in a different cell column a for japanese column b for english and column c for the edited text very maddening to work on
GetMotivated,not_removed,dear man have a reddit hug of death reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,true and gimp was out like years agobut lacked a ton of features and he started years ago some version of cs is even free now really he needs illustrator though for this kind of work not ps but it was even easier to pirate back then still though the fact that he can even used a computer at in let alone uses a software that really isnt even made for anything like this its pretty cool and no matter what he used the art is great
GetMotivated,not_removed,old photoshop is free download with free activation codes on the adobe website because they didnt want to deal with it anymore
GetMotivated,not_removed,krita
GetMotivated,not_removed,gimp is called gimp though
GetMotivated,not_removed,both are trash and non intuitive the way ps is
GetMotivated,not_removed,came here to say that have an upvote
GetMotivated,not_removed,is
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought the same horiuchi never even used excel but he decided to use it this time for two reasons its cheaper than photoshop why in the hell didnt he use gimp and at the same time simpler to use than paint oh thats a good reason
GetMotivated,not_removed,worst case he could just pirate photoshop
GetMotivated,not_removed,i once spent half an hour looking for the change text color tool on gimp
GetMotivated,not_removed,photoshop is only dollars a month
GetMotivated,not_removed,aww dont feel bad its just because that appears to be vector art and photoshop is no good for that you just need to try illustrator
GetMotivated,not_removed,mirror for those who are using ctrlf to find a mirror site
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know right the most pirated program ever atleast he would be creating something worth sharing not turning a slice of pizza into a drop dead gorgeous blonde for ad click bait
GetMotivated,not_removed,seeing how old he is it might be he never heard of gimp and just used what he was familiar with
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you look at his vectors showcased it very much appears possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,at his age im sure hed have tried meeting all the single russian girls in his area first
GetMotivated,not_removed,reddit just hugged the site a little too hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,well there is gimp
GetMotivated,not_removed,or like the other ones that are like or less and good enough
GetMotivated,not_removed,you too weird
GetMotivated,not_removed,the ol hug of death
GetMotivated,not_removed,i aint letting some unfriendly message hold me back google image search art in excel
GetMotivated,not_removed,same
GetMotivated,not_removed,but do you make money off its use i never paid for it until about last year when i actually started making cash with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,cool story bro what else do you steal
GetMotivated,not_removed,inkscape is free
GetMotivated,not_removed,im currently in a graphic design course we have the freedom to use ps or illustrator as desired i dont think a single person in the class used illustrator for anything including vector stuff is there something were missing it just seems like ps is better at everything and gives a lot more tools and options
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think illustrator was that much back then tbh but office was free
GetMotivated,not_removed,doesnt sound like youve seen much
GetMotivated,not_removed,its the adobe website thats where you look
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a cache first comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes that is the art
GetMotivated,not_removed,resolution of kilopixels wide per worksheet what makes that impressive
GetMotivated,not_removed,for whatever reason its the same in china everywhere i go im getting excel files
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey now those of us here got through up till this point and are still on reddit we deserve this
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think so
GetMotivated,not_removed,like were supposed to look at a pic of a cute old man humbly hiding behind his work and not click on it
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,on excel
GetMotivated,not_removed,id like to blur some of my late night expenses
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont understand
GetMotivated,not_removed,ask your grandma shes probably the only person you know who still has one
GetMotivated,not_removed,you da real mvp i would lose my shit if i was in your occupation
GetMotivated,not_removed,thought about getting my cmaavoid eh im year old male w two semesters left in mba program
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats so bad about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,come to public accounting so you can know what selfhatred really feels like
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you kidding me they excel at it
GetMotivated,not_removed,sex cells
GetMotivated,not_removed,well thats why their genitals are pixelated its no good if it cant be rendered by changing colors in cells in excel
GetMotivated,not_removed,its part of the microsoft orifice suite
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is porn for everything but no excel is not for everything
GetMotivated,not_removed,ii wouldnt be surprised
GetMotivated,not_removed,if paradise means copying an empty cell because you thought there was text in it or pasting only to find half of what you wanted come through then these pearly gates have your name on them
GetMotivated,not_removed,access that thing is still used
GetMotivated,not_removed,its tough i still go back to excel cuz i get stuff done so much quicker with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,move to japan you would fit right in
GetMotivated,not_removed,they use power point for things that word could achieve with a minimal sense of understanding ohhhh the headaches are coming back
GetMotivated,not_removed,you know my struggles
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have to hit enter twice if you want it to show up
GetMotivated,not_removed,clearly not if they didnt want to deal with it anymore they would have removed it from their download site and not issued any further activation codes since they are making it available and for free they obviously want to deal with it probably as a gateway software giving it away free is advertising for them
GetMotivated,not_removed,really thanks if thats true ive been using photopea
GetMotivated,not_removed,i prefer calling it gnu image manipulation program
GetMotivated,not_removed,grabs popcorn and chair
GetMotivated,not_removed,so excel is the obvious solution
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol its kind of true i think they even have an open bug report along the lines of our ui sucks inkscape on the other hand i always found really nice to use although it is for vector art so slightly different domain than gimp
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh look gimp is still free
GetMotivated,not_removed,glanced at it your sincerity is suspect
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,i got scared
GetMotivated,not_removed,we did it reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,no i use it for making forum gaming sigs i do it for fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,ur mom
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont get the down votes the comment you replied to was at absolute best intensely boring at worst it shows a bewildering lack of intellect a response so asinine i cant comprehend someone summoning the motivation to tap it out id put money on the fact that if they did acquire ps by other means then they only opened it twice and the second time was by accident
GetMotivated,not_removed,inkscape
GetMotivated,not_removed,im currently in a graphic design course i dont think a single person in the class used illustrator for anything including vector stuff is there something were missing if youre in graphic design course you should learn to use three programs indesign layout illustrator vector graphics photoshop rastered images each program is designed to do what it does best and it provides the necessary tools to do so sure you can use photoshop to do all three functions but youd be lacking the extra tools offered by each individual program plus if you use only ps the file size will become bloated ive worked with gb ps files it can slow your computer import that same image onto a page layout it goes much faster
GetMotivated,not_removed,ba in graphic design here depending on the type of work you are doing you will most definitely need and want to use illustrator at some point when given the option students will use what they are comfortable with which in of cases is photoshop because most people have used it or a similar program like gimp however photoshop cannot touch illustrator for certain types of projects any vector based art and most illustration work is far better accomplished in illustrator due to the nature of it being a vector based program instead of raster like photoshop vector graphics are for all practical purposes infinitely scalable and support modeling and complex lighting everything you create in illustrator is considered an object and can be changed in any way at any time which is a huge asset in my professional work promotionaladvertising design i use both at the same time illustrator layout and base designgraphics and photoshop to edit and prep any images for it as well as do the final cleanup of the finished design if needed take the time to learn illustrator and what its designed to do once you understand how it works it become a very powerful tool
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats your point a month or a year is a utility bill and not easily affordable for a lot of folks including myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,not if you want it for free
GetMotivated,not_removed,nooo zoom out and use the bricks as pixels for whatever resolution you had enough patience for
GetMotivated,not_removed,and for that matter japan still has a hard on for windowsso
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont understand how batman parked his batpod in the dark knight rises and escaped in his batwing and the police never went inside the alley to check for his batpod parked inside the container come on nolan come ooonn buddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know so
GetMotivated,not_removed,snu snu
GetMotivated,not_removed,right its just common sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,hahaha funny i love excel but had no clue it had the capability to produce something so amazing i need to seriously up my excel game man
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you edit in a better paying job maybe touch up that health insurance deductible
GetMotivated,not_removed,like chris rock said nothing good is going to come out of being at the atm at am
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you you magnificent bot
GetMotivated,not_removed,you clicked the link right
GetMotivated,not_removed,the cma doesnt hold much value if you can get your cpa and an it certification
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,take your goddamn upvote and get the hell out of here
GetMotivated,not_removed,spreadcheeks
GetMotivated,not_removed,sexcels
GetMotivated,not_removed,whispers lotus drink caged parrot in the rain
GetMotivated,not_removed,underrated comment of the thread
GetMotivated,not_removed,why didnt you put it in the tax returns folder like the rest of us
GetMotivated,not_removed,wasnt it easier to just change the extension to txt or doc
GetMotivated,not_removed,back orifice
GetMotivated,not_removed,oooh yes mainly smaller companies though
GetMotivated,not_removed,stone cold
GetMotivated,not_removed,no they dont issue codes its just a single simple text site with a single code that anyone can use it even explains to use the code because they dont support it anymore so you cant purchase an activation
GetMotivated,not_removed,that and it was purchased software not rented so they didnt want to have to give refunds to people who bought it when they took the activation servers down making the old versions unusable
GetMotivated,not_removed,i prefer calling it gnus not unix image manipulation program
GetMotivated,not_removed,you know what else is free uitchyks mom
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cant understand the motivation for someone to tap once as the result of his post yet somehow you mustered enough for
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont get it either the guy implied that he pirates things like photoshop i guess these guys dont like the truth being pointed out
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel even more stupider just by having read it
GetMotivated,not_removed,one thing i found china to be more advanced in than western countries is they routinely use cell phone photos as perfectly valid document copies in canada and this was just a few years ago i had to fax documents to half the official or legal agencies fax only and many businesses or other procedures needed a proper xerox photocopy for id or whatever else in china ive used a cell phone picture to get official visa documents and nearly anything else that would require a copy id travel tickets etc they accept it everywhere it seems
GetMotivated,not_removed,he parked the batpot inside the batwing
GetMotivated,not_removed,hows the weather in bangalore
GetMotivated,not_removed,snoo snoo
GetMotivated,not_removed,you could try to clone stamp my salary the healing brush tool will take care of your deductibles
GetMotivated,not_removed,you just need some more lense flare
GetMotivated,not_removed,sbstalkthreadmy pleasure
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry mate but my sanity is worth a lot more than that
GetMotivated,not_removed,its like drinking till the pain over but whats worse the pain or the hangover
GetMotivated,not_removed,the one that only a small minority of folks from prestigious colleges can get yeah thats not accurate for of accountants and corporate finance unless you get a cfa charter
GetMotivated,not_removed,like what kind of certifications not an it person just curious
GetMotivated,not_removed,would you mind elaborating a little on this
GetMotivated,not_removed,well fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,take your damn upvote and go
GetMotivated,not_removed,creampie charts
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats called a backdoor security flaw
GetMotivated,not_removed,my point still stands if they didnt want to deal with it they wouldnt offer it even at this level
GetMotivated,not_removed,i prefer calling it gnus not unix not unix image manipulation program
GetMotivated,not_removed,can confirm
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the herpes medication isnt
GetMotivated,not_removed,correct i dont understand the motivation for downvoting the comment which is why i replied stating my position i cant find the logic or perspective in your statement though the downvotes were the motivation for me responding its inversely proportional can you confirm the idea you wanted to communicate something like if you observe an opinion you share expressed in a comment being downvoted without any context or cause you should not be motivated to engage in any discourse rather just ignore it or neutralize downvotes with an upvote if that is how you see it why did you reply can you explain why the preferable course of action is different
GetMotivated,not_removed,even more stupider
GetMotivated,not_removed,stupider
GetMotivated,not_removed,did gotham legalize
GetMotivated,not_removed,the spirit is willing but the flesh is spongy and bruised
GetMotivated,not_removed,it shall be
GetMotivated,not_removed,im out of material its been fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,gonna assume youre not a programmer
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah but whats better living or dying
GetMotivated,not_removed,care to explain why you say so im planning on being a cpa myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,i forget the name but the aicpa offers an it auditing credential to show that you understand information systems technologies accounting roles are also taking on information security duties so it pays to let employers know youre trained n that field
GetMotivated,not_removed,the cpa is much more prestigious and it lets employers know that you understand the entire body of knowledge in financial management and tax accounting the cma is too limited in scope and doesnt add value unless you already have the cpa certification
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes andor maybe they do it additionally to deal with hackers who could inject stuff in their files orand to get a few less people pirating the new photoshop versions because they simply need something better than gimp
GetMotivated,not_removed,you called
GetMotivated,not_removed,at least shes not dollars a month
GetMotivated,not_removed,basically you were so bewildered over someone clicking a button as is if its this thing that requires serious deliberation and thought im glad you take your voting so serious on here though the world needs more people like you i cant really explain your confusion though unfortunately i wasnt one of the downvoters and i think this thread is pretty stale by now just taking a wild guess though maybe they disagreed with the comment they were downvoting
GetMotivated,not_removed,my magic wand can slice you a new canvas try to catch it with the polygon lasso tool
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope but i know basic java
GetMotivated,not_removed,using salary to justify why youre doing a job is not the definition of happiness to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,same routine every quarter not very exciting work hard to feel like youve contributed to anything significant or time worthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol yeah being in cali is almost to do with it a midtier uc is still better than most accounting and finance programs nationwide in the midwest south and southwest youre looking at upper to mid range for the first five years with increases to around based on performance not everyone congregates to the coasts you know
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd think theyd teach you that in grad school at the end of the day cpa and mba would open a few doors no im in outside sales right now for a national industrial supply company and make about i definitely dont want to be in sales forever it was a job though and paid wasnt for a skeezy company and offered full benefits also i figured and everyone told me sales experience is always a big plus anyways ive been applying to jobs at companies such as perrigo and wolverine worldwide and havent even gotten a response i know i am not technically done with it yet but i figured it would at least land me a few more interviews i live in mi btw you seem like someone who is well versed and has been around the block sorry for unloading but i had to ask
GetMotivated,not_removed,wat
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you liquefy my debts to about half their size
GetMotivated,not_removed,all right ill fill you in in programming a patch is data that shows the difference between one state of a file folder etc to another state this includes changing lines of code addingremoving files etc these patches are often distributed to members that have the older version of the project so that they could update their project without having to download the whole project from scratch adobe photoshops patch however just merges images together in a way that looks smooth
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree but thats assuming you have another option what would you rather or could be doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,but living in the midwest is also way cheaper than living in cali effective buying power is probably roughly the same
GetMotivated,not_removed,make america great again thanks for voting in donnie boy
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds like you have some good assets that employers would value highly are you looking for a career in public accounting or corporate my experience is all in public and imo you may be a good fit for it assuming youre interested in audit too many socially inept accounting majors going into public and not having the interpersonal skills needed to perform audit work manage a team out in the field etc please keep working on the cpa it really is a major talent signal to employers even outside of accounting however i suggest you also consider the credential to show that youre ready for the future not just the present
GetMotivated,not_removed,firstname pseudonym lastname that guy doesnt have a pseudo but its breaking the template of magichearthstonegamers in general so they put brian kibler as his pseudonym brian brian kibler kibler he got sick of it and asked to not be called that way brian please do not call me brian brian kibler kibler kibler then there is another layer for some reasons meme i guess and a mistake in it because ¯ツ¯
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you history brush my assets to before my exwife left me

GetMotivated,not_removed,oh the irony
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree with the old saying knowledge is power because it is applied knowledge that is power
GetMotivated,not_removed,now thats an ironic quote if ive ever read one
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me thats what the quote says
GetMotivated,not_removed,take a deep breath and focus on an immediate solution then focus on the next step and then the one after that
GetMotivated,not_removed,overwrite
GetMotivated,not_removed,im amazed at the positivity here keep motivating people
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont overthink things just work on becoming better and work hard even when you dont want to your future self will thank you for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was recently trying to understand that feeling since i am no longer studying and i am working there is no way to be lazy at work when you have to be there and use your time so i am doing fine in these parts of my life but i still have problem in my creative endeavours after work for my hobby or vain glory when you think you want to work on your dreams being anything painting writing for me its programming i could just say why work again when i dont need it but its somehow i get some feeling i did something creative instead of just spending time with games or youtube so somehow one part of myself tells me to do some creative ideas i have and it always goes like omg what if i tried this and made this in a big project but then i end up in the enthousiasm but its hard to actually motivating me doing it one part wants the other is like why bother but then i realized by the time i created some kind of fear some self fullfiling prophecy that tells me you are going to fail again so dont bother i am trying to come in terms with it somehow the emotional struggle that you know you are gonna encounter again when sitting down to work makes you dont even wanna work on that and you find some ways to avoid it but then when you realize and you want to sit down and work you feel this awful dread and usually you think maybe if i sit down i will finish with the project i wanted to work with but usually you realize that the project needs more time and even if under struggle you manage to work on it you finished and you wont get rid it easilly and maybe its not correct to think that you work only to get rid of it something is wrong here didnt you want to work on it in the first place unless its bs university that you have to do i am trying to learn to do things not because i wanted them or not not thinking of the goal trying to enjoy the process and disregard the feeling of having to finish something to get rid of expecting always results etc i have some big projects in the future and i realize that if i cant even get along with small tasks there is no way i can focus on the big stuff and its depressing i am not saying i have much success in that even after i realize the problem but then doing creative stuff outside your job for example is not something our caveman would want i do believe procrastination is natural yet because we chase bigger success and are never sattisfied we struggle between the primitive mind and our illusionary personality of how we imagine ourselves to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,my first question to you would be why do you want to do the though things what is your motivation for being in this situation once you have a clear vision of your goal and why you should overcome the difficulties then it will get easier to do this has helped me alot and many other people but it is not neccesarily as easy as it sounds you should be especially on the lookout for the distinction between selfmotivation and induced motivation which means some goals are purely driven by yourself you have actively chosen this goal for yourself this is selfmotivation induced motivation is goals that you have and may believe are actively chosen by you but once you delwe into them it becomes more and more clear that they are not your own actively chosen goals and could come from societal norms friends family media etc concretely the advise about taking a deep breath and focusing on one thing at a time is also very helpful in the endeavor to find your own motivation hope it helps
GetMotivated,not_removed,take one step even if its a lame stupid not well formulated step this will give you drive as many times we are afraid of taking a step if we are not confident it will be perfect fuck that take a shitty step then build on that good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,break everything down into smaller parts for example im studying biochemistry in college i have to write up a lab report sounds a bit daunting when you think of all the different parts of it introduction aims materials methods results calculations discussion conclusion references but by splitting it up like that i can say ill write up the introduction aims and materials now tomorrow i could do the methods calculations and results that leaves me with just the discussion conclusion to do and to list any references used on the third day break everything down into manageable chunks and you can do anything like they say rome wasnt built in day
GetMotivated,not_removed,its hard to change who you are it takes some real nose to the grindstone attitude doing things youve never done before to really change who you are i really recommend the book psychocybernetics by maxwell maltz it discusses how you literally cant be anything but your selfimage as your selfimage forms your goals behaviors and even capabilities one way or another youre going to have to change your selfimage to instill new behaviors this can be done inadvertently by forcechanging behavior but it can be profoundly influenced more effectively and efficiently through other methods he talks about in his book its one of the best selling selfhelp books of all time and is grounded in psychology its a really great read whats really helped me is understanding the concept of daringness everything that we can do in this life we must dare to do we must dare to do that assignment weve been putting off we must dare to push it a little farther than weve ever been testing new limits and therefore changing our understanding of whats possible for us your selfimage next time you hit that wall where you feel like youre going to give up dare yourself to go a little bit further i bit youve just hit a psychological wall and once youve pushed yourself a little bit further youll get the ball rolling again and regain your confidence just keep daring yourself its amazing feeling once youve pushed your limits and until then just egg yourself on and say you wont finish this assignment you wont
GetMotivated,not_removed,usually when feeling lazy i promise myself to work hard for minutes with distractions and thats it mostly i am in working mode after that and i just keep working in the very few times i am not in working mode i take a break eat well
GetMotivated,not_removed,my solution was to start reading lots of books on audio about motivation and happiness and hire a life coach i still struggle with motivation real change is gradual be gentle with yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,play some dark souls and get used to masochism easy life easy souls
GetMotivated,not_removed,just do anything towards your goal however small it may be and youll pick up momentum quickly inaction usually leads to procrastination and the feeling of being overwhelmed
GetMotivated,not_removed,one thing i do for that is preparation in my downtime i make sure to do something active and find a way to rest within that usually hiking for me meditation also helps both of those allow me to maintain my center in a variety of stressful situations
GetMotivated,not_removed,successful people do what needs to be done whether the feel like it or not elliot hulse i think
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know the feel its gotten to the point where i just have so much to do that im paralyzed and i freeze and dont do any of it its starting to become a real problem so what i did the other day is make a todo list of every single thing i have to do it was huge but then i divided that list into smaller ones titled asap should do and when you can that way i can focus on priorities rather than stalling by doing something unimportant if you want divide those lists even further and take it one step at a time reward yourself by taking a minute break when you finish something good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,i live in your town so next time you feel lazy ill give you my and ill come over and kick you in the arse
GetMotivated,not_removed,exercise and eating healthy can also guide you in the right direction ive found that just chilling out and also visualizing getting stuff done works as well i also used to get like this but ive tackled the problem by asking myself why i was afraid and once i figured out why i was afraid i realized it was dumb lol also quitting drugs if youre into that stuff and alcohol temporarily although a little extreme has helped me
GetMotivated,not_removed,focus on your discipline ignore your current feelings quitting feels good now discipline feels good later but lasts much longer
GetMotivated,not_removed,i grabbed onto this question and thought i could pound out some sound advice what do you want to be known as as a business person and as a person recognized by yourself i would suggest that you not be so weak as to let your lazy side conquer you i often tell my daughter and myself we need to be more than what we are working hard requires more commitment than just blowing stuff off do you wash your ass or think about just going in dirty and letting people smell your dirty ass you got to clean up your act if you just take a pencil and work for minutes on an assignment or problem youll soon look up and see minutes passed if your are thinking about solving something i hated working hard all the time myself but it became my life face to the work world because once i started searching for a solution or seeking progress it came and i went on with it if anything people saw me as a too much of a go getter write out about things you need to do or process through and if you get through or so youve had a productive day to be blunt good work is a reward to yourself nobody can take that away from you if you do it change the truth about yourself i was lazy but i changed that just go do that reward yourself even if it doesnt change your paycheck or coworkers there are some basic problems that you have to commit to tackle and believe me commitment is a big deal to get going
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think most of us are guilty of choosing to do things that are easy so that we dont have to put much effort into the truth is when we do tasks that are difficult that is where we are most rewarded you greatly improve your experienceknowledgeskills and usually these difficult tasks are more important in the grand scheme of things my only tips are that you understand how beneficial it is to struggle but keep on going also make sure you have a clear understanding of why you are doing something rather than just saying i have to try saying because it will or something
GetMotivated,not_removed,getting overwhelmed is a natural feeling we humans are governed by our mindset if we change the way we think we can do much more the universe places obstacles in our path to see if we willing to work hard for things we want as soon as we realize what the universe is doing to us we can stop take a breath and find a solution for how we can move past this overwhelming feeling this easiest thing to do is to give up but the greatest thing to do is take a deep breath and break through this barrier and once you through life will be a breeze until the next barrier think of it as a video game when you become overwhelmed its the end of the stage and all these obstacles are thrown at you the world is against you once you get past these obstacles you will clear that level and move on to the next level as you go through the game it becomes a little simpler you gained experience my advise is when you feel this way again look at yourself in the mirror and say these words i am worth more than this i will go through any obstacle say this over and over again while looking at yourself in the eye take a few deep breaths and approach that overwhelming situation stay positive and all the solutions will come to you 😀 best of luck✌️️
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats interesting i am afraid to work hard too but for a totally different reason i used to be a hard worker who always tried his best but over time i learned that the more i try the more i suffer i dont mean bad coincidences happen like i start taking extra good care of my teeth only to chip one the next week although that happens too i mean i would come to work early and stay late and take on extra projects and still be the only new hire to get fired id start a political organization and start getting calls from the fbi id exercise and injure myself by trying too hard id get a girlfriend and lose all my friends i guess what im saying is that im envious of your problem if all i had to do is work hard to be successful id be living the good life right now i never feel overwhelmed and i eventually get bored enough to start doing my best again but like clockwork something will happen putting me two steps back working hard is unproductive but then again i dont come from money i hear that when rich people work hard like trump it actually does benefit them at least ive finally learned the happiest life im capable of living is one of inebriated mediocrity
GetMotivated,not_removed,i so many times fail that when it comes to next fail i tell to myself this time i dont give up and will fight even the greatest fail and so they give up no no they fight again i can do the same it helps me may be you also help
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i can be im extremely lazy but when i work i work balance the good with the bad thats what lifes about
GetMotivated,not_removed,definitely this you are probably feeling overwhelmed because of a few other things too so just clearing your mind and taking things step by step is a good way to grind it out you can do it man
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the tip this will certainly help
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are right having a good habit is definitely a good way to keep one disciplined
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is really it i came from a world where i really never had to try i was smart enough that i never studied for tests for high school or college and then one day i set out on my own to work for myself suddenly i was paralyzed by not knowing what to do or how to do it i didnt have anyone to give me a textbook to figure out life at first i just sat in my home office and pretended to work but did nothing but sit on my phone then i finally got the guts to just try and figure things out one small bite at a time before too long i was making pretty good money and now im teaching others when i can its never too late to figure things out
GetMotivated,not_removed,im actually about to do this myself go out on my own and try to make a living working for myself and im scared the same thingll happen to me you mentioned teaching others is there a vid series or something that i could check out
GetMotivated,not_removed,no i dont have anything like that but i would be glad to help you out or at least point you in the right direction feel free to pm me on here letting me know how you want to get out on your own and maybe i could help you out if i can help maybe we could start a mentorship kinda thing if talking to a stranger on the internet is a little too wierd i understand and wish you the best
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok lets help each other
GetMotivated,not_removed,long live the king
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for posting this i was a big fan of the smashing pumpkins once upon a time and i definitely appreciated this article
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a good looking guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,be excited be inspired wanting to livewow he really is asking a lot of us mortals
GetMotivated,not_removed,any serious effort to expand into space should be mostly an open source community project if not completely
GetMotivated,not_removed,how about you put some of that passion into a nicer looking image
GetMotivated,not_removed,but has he been to burning man
GetMotivated,not_removed,he is peddling dystopia
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wouldnt trust my life with of the open source stuff ive seen
GetMotivated,not_removed,you already have
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure how many life saving opensource projects there are out there but if there were im sure theyd be outstanding that being said what i have seen of opensource ie appache gnulinux lame python mozilla are just incredible python specifically is creating a revolution in computational physics
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah and look where its got me
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i dont know about you personally but open source has taken the internet to amazing hights something like of the internet servers are built on open source technologies and still growing specifically because of the trust the internet community has in opensource furthermore studies in the uk indicate that open source projects tend to be far more productive than commercial efforts they also tend to have longer lifecycles better multinational integration and collaboration and encourage a more natual developmental pathway now to counter your presumed stance look where the experts have taken space exploration and look and the budget its alomst unbelievable a note worth mentioning is how nasa said it was impossible that forced induction rocket motors would operate safely now they buy them from the people that trusted the technologily had merit the bottom line is i know the experts dont have what it takes to get off this rock alone not all the investment capital and misappropriation of tax dollars in the world would be enough i think even the experts know that a good municipal example of open source would be hamburg germany where virtuall all commerial solutions have been replaced by open source technologies or those inspired by them not only because they trust the technological mereit but they specifically appriciate the freedom opensource inherently provides
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,as much as empowering it is what they tell you however motivating it is i dont think people should follow it word by word i mean there are people who would do that because whats being said to you promises a better you i think we must absolutely listen to whats being said but at the same time process that information through our own brain rather than blindly following it these ideas and views come from different persons who has different personalities you cant really combine everything and follow it moreover you shouldnt in the first place what do you guys think
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think if you have the competence to say something like this other people are also able to decide whether or not something is worth implementing into their daily life id argue its an integral part of life itself knowing how to do things without knowing how intuition instinct and so on not to mention connection itself we love to relate to others and be able to influence them personally i cant think of many better feelings than when i hear someone who is scary similar to me personality wise talk passionately about something that is also close to me yeah were all different but were all the same you know
GetMotivated,not_removed,personally i cant think of many better feelings than when i hear someone who is scary similar to me personality wise talk passionately about something that is also close to me exactly hmm yes i guess you do know when something is related to you and when other isnt but probably what i meant from my comment is sometimes the advise kinda ignores the effect you have on other people when you follow some of the aggressive advises yeah even i get a feeling that this is very rare or even not that important but you do run into people who are very focused on their own self and life that they ignoreneglect their surroundings familyfriendscolleagues one might say that this isnt really in our hands people do what they want to do but at times you lose track of how you impact others in small ways and most of those times its not your fault per se its just what it is eventually what i tried to say was this problemthing would be avoided if people do think upon the advises and motivation rules etc rather than just acting directly upon it im sure there are other advantages as well which one can obtain on doing this
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be honest i didnt even watch the video and didnt really have a main outlined point to make with what i said it was just a bunch of words i thought were relevant lol youre definitely right though theres a gray area between wanting to be focused on your own goals ignoring everyone elses life and becoming a sort of protagonist thinking other people are just obstacles without lives of their own i guess this sort of stuff is something people learn through an amalgamation of personal experiences because those profound events in life that change your perspective seem to really change your subconscious as discussions like this for me at least tend to just create cognitive dissonance because i know i dont wanna act a certain way but physiologically its the only way ive conditioned myself to act social anxiety for example but i could talk forever bout that sort of shit so ill stop here before i go off on another tangent x
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be honest i didnt even watch the video and didnt really have a main outlined point to make with what i said it was just a bunch of words i thought were relevant lol haha ya i got that you neednt see the video actually i was just saying wrt motiv vids in general per se yeah you got my point cheers before i go off on another tangent x haha ikr thats how many nights flew away once upon a time nowadays its just random tv shows and movies hmm sulk
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you want something to watch in free time that doesnt feel so wasteful i could recommend although the stuff he says might be pretty idiosyncratic to most people
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmmm cool will look into it when i got some time
GetMotivated,not_removed,that might be hard i have really strong excuses theyre practically reasons
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am stronger than you
GetMotivated,not_removed,do i have to be stronger than all of them or do i just have to be stronger than the weakest one
GetMotivated,not_removed,jokes on u theyre not excuses
GetMotivated,not_removed,nuh uuh
GetMotivated,not_removed,good shit man keep on fighting
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome ive lost lbs recently doing about the same thing just counting calories with a stupidly easy phone app i would add pay attention to the excuses you make for yourself and stop for me it was things like baby weight slower metabolism after harder for women to lose etc just ignore all of it and try a little bit harder
GetMotivated,not_removed,less food weight loss got it
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep going man keep sticking to the plan you made if you have final weight goal let us know and keep posting so that we can keep giving support good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are an inspiration mate may i know what you use for tracking calories
GetMotivated,not_removed,congratulations to you i have been following a similar diet but limit to carbs a day and have lost pounds in just over a year and dropped waist sizes keep trudging through
GetMotivated,not_removed,former fat boy here keep up the good work bro itll all be gone before you know it and theres nothing better than feeling healthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have been feeling helpless at and yrs old maybe i dont need fad diets and pills im gonna try again
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre a legend keep up the solid work no place worth going to is going to be easy
GetMotivated,not_removed,congratulations im happy you still indulge in your favorite foods keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,what i dont understand is you eat calories a day right how much do you need to burn off to lose weight or do you just eat the calories a day only and any sports you do is extra i dont get what people are saying
GetMotivated,not_removed,hi congrats on losing pounds thats really impressive i just have to respond here because using some simple math i calculated that youre eating about of fat now there is nothing inherently wrong with fat however that is a lot as in way too much try to limit fat to a maximum of of your total calories right now its about of your diet try eating of protein per pound of lean bodyweight and raise your carbs a little in order to reduce your fat intake your total calorie intake is great its just that the macronutrients could use some work keep going youll be a healthier version of yourself every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,congratulations on making the change but man thats crazy i can only eat a day to lose any weight my maintenance is something like
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you havent already shoot over to rketo
GetMotivated,not_removed,congratulations youre doing great
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats friend pounds is tremendous and i know for sure youll reach your ultimate goal if you keep at it also im stoked you mentioned carbs cause that is a massive factor with obese people easy weight gainers like me and my family i noticed a few years ago when i hit that restricting my calories and exercising daily was not working like it used to in my early so i read books and articles on damn near every diet vegan juicing mediterranean paleo south beach etc and settled on a ketogenic diet rketo was a great resource as a starting point to fix my metabolic issues my closest friends and i made a pact to cut our carbs to under for months with a high fat moderate protein intake and we ended up looking better than we did in our teens nowadays we do carb cycle—to reboot the fat loss build muscle keep our thyroid happy and reward ourselves every weekend—but it all started with what you said that fire that drive that willingness to persevere or die trying much appreciated male years
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i was about years old i was like it was really depressing one of the worst things for me was actually stand up in front of a mirror and see all those extra skin one day i though well i dont need to be like that so i mentally prepared myslef for that first thing i did was a lot of walking everyday no need for destination or how much you will walk that day just walk other thing was eating when im really hungry some would say that is not healthy but for me actually was good and best starting point ofc you will have some difficulties every time i would need to eat i would put some normalsmall portions of food i think is very good process of tricking the brain and after some weeks i noticed i really didnt have to eat that much more now im and only thing now is to actually do some exercises to lose some and loose skin point is make up your mind set up goals do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,good for you thanks for the motivation
GetMotivated,not_removed,day for me today so it is great to see that yes you can do it good on you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing keep it up life would be easier for many of us if that worked for everyone my best friend used to be overweight and she tried everything to lose weight healthy eating and exercises as much as she could handle helped her lose lbs and that was it she tried lowcarbs diets it helped but as soon as she started eating normally the lbs she had lost came back she was always very suspicious of pills but then after trying everything else she decided to give it a try she did lots of research on the internet and found some real customer httpexpertratedreviewscomcategoryreviews she picked one and after checking with her doctor she started taking it she didnt give up on eating healthily and working out though in a couple of months she lost lbs more what i wanted to say is that sometimes it seems like youre doing everything right but you dont see any result this makes you lose motivation and go back to unhealthy lifestyle and feeling unhappy keep on try harder and dont be afraid to try something new but do this responsibly
GetMotivated,not_removed,carb the fuck up go vegan and get shit done low fat low protein high carb
GetMotivated,not_removed,been taking a pill called contrave for months lost pounds so far limits cravings so along with watching what you eat and the pill to help not crave stuff i was drinking a coke or two a day plus a red bull or two nothing but water juice and milk amazingly dont miss soda or red bull when i used to need them to get through my day congrats to you guys doing it by just will power alone but if someone else needs help check with your doctor for a prescription and coupon to help with the cost
GetMotivated,not_removed,hell yea j was now im down to the hype train is reallll
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey man if you dont mind answering question what is the app pm me if u dont wanna advertise you only restrict ur dieet to calories and no sports you dont have to burn calories to lose weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,your body burns calories at a certain rate dependent on your activity level current weight genetics etc exercise sports as you put it will increase the amount you burn but isnt necessary many apps including myfitnesspal will allow you to enter your weight age activity level and estimate for your how many calories your should eat to lose weight but its just a guideline as everyone is different i hope that helps
GetMotivated,not_removed,youve got this
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow terrible effort
GetMotivated,not_removed,this high fathigh protein diets with very low carb isnt sustainable a plant based diet is sustainable though and will help you live longer theres obviously good carbs and bad carbs but we need the good carbs to thrive and live a healthy life
GetMotivated,not_removed,same here brah the feels are real
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes the loseit app is what i have ive also taken a break from using it because i was able to reset my bodys expectation for calorie intake its hard to believe how much i was overeating some days
GetMotivated,not_removed,the app is called loseit and it is very convenient and easy to use you can find restaurant foods and scan bar codes and it really does the work for you it told me at first i needed like calories a day to lose a pound a week but i adjusted because i was really hungry i didnt track exercise but i have three kids so im pretty active i did calories a day and lost a pound or two a week its all about getting closer to the base level of calories your body needs and burns anyway you can burn a few hundred calories here or there but if youre eating an extra meal a day theres no way youre going to lose weight good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome i have lose it installed here too but havent been sincere hopefully will stay inspired from now on
GetMotivated,not_removed,im just trying to get a vision of losing weight just need to know time gap between each meal p
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks im gonna try this for sure
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would be fantastic if youd update us with your diet and workout routine im sure many of us would offer our advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,what im helping the guy make his journey easier way healthier
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for the fast responds i weight kg and now i weigh but not the same manners as you and op i just ate eggs a day and like run for each day but now that doesnt work and im stuck at kg im so frustrated
GetMotivated,not_removed,its shocking when you start really paying attention i splurged one day and got a fast food chicken sandwich which was all by itself half my daily calories for one menu item
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you kind sir yes i can
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for the fast responds i weight kg and now i weigh but not the same manners as you and op i just ate eggs a day and like run for each day but now that doesnt work and im stuck at kg im so frustrated
GetMotivated,not_removed,i saw make happy live by far the best comedy ive seen in a long long time﻿
GetMotivated,not_removed,do we know when it gets released
GetMotivated,not_removed,yess thats so soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,that looks like jim carrey dressed as his character from the movie man on the moon standing in front of a mirror mumbling words of encouragement and commitment to himself convincing himself to be true to his characters role just before filming love jim love the movie
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont view an intimidating subject like some large mountain to scale chunk it break it up into manageable shortterm goals its not a single massive goal its today im going to spend x hours on this tomorrow ill worry about tomorrow its really important to set a reasonable daily goal and then stick to it as for the anxiety try to turn it into an external voice a like another person who is pessimistic about everything you respond to the voice dont worry itll be okay dont try to disregard the anxiety otherwise it will always be there try to figure out what specifically the anxiety is saying even if you cant analyze yourself to the point where you really what deep down is causing the anxiety you can still give the anxiety more concrete form and then address it head on yeah i know i screwed up before but i learned what to do and what not to do and this time will be different one step at a time
GetMotivated,not_removed,its very simple youre going to use a combo of selfhypnosis and visualization the youll revisit the anxiety and pause it just like you would pause a television set then youre going to imagine that you are spraying the image with liquid nitrogen the stuff that freeze things instantly do an inner dialogue and tell your brain see the cell that has the memory is froze when its frozen its deactivated it cant hurt me any more keep telling yourself that and imagine that youre sitting in class in college any anxiety response you feel imagine that youve sprayed it with liquid nitrogen and tell your brain it cant hurt you now the fun part imagine that youre sitting behind the controls of a wrecking ball imagine the wrecking ball is smashing the frozen image then imagine that you are sitting behind the controls of a road paver that machine with the giant wheel that flattens out roads imagine that you are going over the broken smashed image imagine you hear the crunching of the image as it is being obliterated then imagine youre holding a huge fire hose and washing the whole thing away ive been working with two people that were suffering with anxiety and the anxiety is almost gone by doing this visualization daily on a regular basis youll weaken the neuropathway that triggers the anxiety and eventually it will disappear like its nothing youll actually look back and wonder what was the big deal
GetMotivated,not_removed,i suffer from anxiety as well and due to different events in my life i have been stuck in the last class of my bachelors for about or years procrastinating is paralyzing anxiety is paralyzing i agree that it is useful to chunk things out even then it can be self defeating every day one step at the time is what i like to do i have a notebook were i write the stuff i needwant to do sometimes it helps me seeing them in paper to start deconstructing them i also write how i feel it helps me identify what i am actually feeling sometimes it even helps me to write myself notes the lift me up eg i know you dont feel good right now but you will feel better soon keep trying keep swimming
GetMotivated,not_removed,where was this thread when i needed it in college where was this last week when i was studying for my certification that i failed doesnt matter because i have this thread now
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you know where i can buy it from it looks awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,if im correct op got this from mit so im not sure you can buy it
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea as said i got it from mit in the mail so i dont think you can purchase it
GetMotivated,not_removed,showing more class than their older counterparts for sure well done lads
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair play above all﻿
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,that kind of made my day reminding me of the good old times
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly my thinking
GetMotivated,not_removed,i felt stress and worry melt from me while listening thank you for this its incredible

GetMotivated,not_removed,doesnt shifu mean master in chinese so master master
GetMotivated,not_removed,personally all the kung fu panda movies had something really important to say and i still think back to them this day it carried me through college and its always helped me on rough days the first one had a simple message there is no secret ingredient po was lead to believe that the dragon scroll had the secret to becoming the kung fu master it took a simple noodle analogy for him to realize that there is no secret to it he himself was the secret ingredient and his hardwork and determination showed that kung fu has the problem of inner peace everyone on this earth has an internal battle with themselves on a day to day basis sometimes we find ourselves simply avoiding our problems and as the movie shows po has hit a wall in his training he has inner pain that he has suppressed and it is holding him back our pain our problems will also hold us back unless we take the time to deal with them no matter how painful they may be in pos case it took like minutes for some it may take months or maybe even years as shown by master shifu then we get to kung fu with the quote you put dreamworks has had some hits and misses these past couple years but i believe they did kung fu panda justice making them my favorite movies from them with the original shrek trailing behind they have heart and soul put into them from the animations to the the music in all movies and it goes to show that animations like this can inspire motivation in us in ways we didnt think they could
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i let go of what i am i become what i might be – lao tzu
GetMotivated,not_removed,read this as i was struggling through understanding css the first serious bit of any kind of coding i have done in years not knowing something and setting out to learn how to do it has always propelled me further forward the fear is just fuel
GetMotivated,not_removed,are we the same person i literally watched this no more then or hours ago and had a mini revelation myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you keep on thinking what you always thought youre gonna keep on getting what you always got
GetMotivated,not_removed,true but a word of caution in this day and age where even the slightest mistake is grounds for a court case you may need to check things out thoroughly before you proceed and even then be prepared for haters who will drag your good name and reputation through mud sometimes just because they thought you werent grovelling and subservient enough to be worth the alreadydiscounted expense and time spent
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just watched this today with my kid and had the same aha moment kinda creepy
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is literally my desktop background kung full panda is my favourite movie
GetMotivated,not_removed,its nice and witty but not true but then again moat one liners proverbs arent either
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh wow i just watched this last night myself for the first time this quote made me pause the movie and say pretty much the same thing to the wife
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is well said you did good paying attention now take what has been given to you allow it to grow within you so that when it ripens you can share with others what you have learned never hide your light under a bushel for no one will ever see it here is another motivational quote from another kung fu moviethe forbidden kingdom when jackie chan as lu yan jet li as the silent monk are discussing what true kung fu is kungfu hard work over time to accomplish skill a painter can have kungfu or the butcher who cuts meat every day with such skill his knife never touches bonethe musician can have kungfu or the poet who paints pictures with words and makes emperors weep this too is kungfuformless nameless the true master dwells within only you can free him learn the form but seek the formless hear the soundless learn it all then forget it all learn the way then find your own waybut do not name it my friend for it is like water nothing is softer than water yet it can overcome rock it does not fight it flows around the opponent formless nameless
GetMotivated,not_removed,so i should do what i cant do so i can be better but i cant do it so im fucked
GetMotivated,not_removed,literally just finished this movie on netflix
GetMotivated,not_removed,i watched this yesterday and when i heard this line i instantly thought i was going to see it here to be fair its a great line
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is similar to if you always do what youve always done youll always get what youve always got mark twain theyre both awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is kind of a non sequitur
GetMotivated,not_removed,the true answer was i dont know but i will try the answer i gave every time yes the life lesson if you know how to do it of the way then you can figure it out dont sell yourself short or shy away from opportunities because you dont know everything saying i dont know but i will try is selling yourself short more than than yes is
GetMotivated,not_removed,this describes my current foray into business analytics
GetMotivated,not_removed,this applies very to art someone is like i cant draw that but thats the point
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you only do what you are sure you can do then you will probably not develop as quickly
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes i love this quote have it written down on the front of my notes it really hit me when i rewatched the film i didnt pick up on it the first time
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you want from master shifu
GetMotivated,not_removed,i clicked on this thread thinking this was the master shifu from mr vampire
GetMotivated,not_removed,this makes no fucking sense if you strive to achieve the impossible and achieve it then youve achieved what you can do how the hell do you get better at what you are if you cant do anything you cant do
GetMotivated,not_removed,fake it till you make it
GetMotivated,not_removed,was just watching that minutes ago what a coincidence
GetMotivated,not_removed,be careful with that rule though the remaining could cost you more time and effort than the other did take that into account when you give a quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need this on a motivational pictureanyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,upvoted because of master shifu
GetMotivated,not_removed,by definition nobody has ever done anything that they cant do
GetMotivated,not_removed,remindme days
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgonwpoxbmi
GetMotivated,not_removed,i mean practice is the concept of doing what you can do now so that what you can do is even more later id argue a much better piece of advice is professionals dont practice until they can do something they practice until you couldnt fail at it if youre looking for better longterm advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,so we are now at a time where life lessons can be taken from cartoons gotcha humanitys sanity is at risk
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a follow up to your follow up the master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried
GetMotivated,not_removed,this one stayed with me from the first time i heard it ive even bought a poster for my son who loves at with the saying on it as he gets really selfdefeatist if he fails at something im sure that this one line from a cartoon has inspired my boy to push past his walls and get better at his math homework skateboarding footy skills
GetMotivated,not_removed,super mario brosmario mario
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes it does i noticed this when i was learning mandarin out in china haha 师傅 pronounced shīfu
GetMotivated,not_removed,or master teacher so it works
GetMotivated,not_removed,which begs the question what is his name in china
GetMotivated,not_removed,or his name sounds like shifu purposely where do you think shifus master name comes from hint its wu gui
GetMotivated,not_removed,shifu is also what you call your kung fu instructor i believe a bit like in karate calling your instructor sensei
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just have the same thought shift means master in chinese and i am a chinese master master haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,came here for the same reason oh dreamworks and your hidden jokes
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds like a hipster band
GetMotivated,not_removed,it more accurately means teacher
GetMotivated,not_removed,also means teacher
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes i might point out it more accurately means you are my masterteachermentor more than i am a master at x so in a way its less master and more mentor laoshi is probably still the better word for teacher however
GetMotivated,not_removed,it means teacher but yes in this context hes literally master master even funnier is that you would put shifu behind his name just as you would sensei so in chinese hed be shifu shifu or master shifu if they comically translate it
GetMotivated,not_removed,deleted
GetMotivated,not_removed,it means father teacher but it is different than the japanese sensei because there is only one and your teachers are your sisters and brothers if i were learning a japanese martial art then the person who is teaching me is sensei my teacher but if im learning a form of kung fu then the person teaching me is my sister or brother i am learning from my sister or brother there is only one shifu
GetMotivated,not_removed,what do you mean doesnt it i feel like you just know that or you dont
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for your comment after reading i realized how i will never be too grown up to watch the significant movies of my childhood every time i watch movies like the lion king and the kung fu panda movies i pick up on both subtle and overt messages that went way over my head as a kid these movies now provide me with the perfect mixture of nostalgia goofiness and heartstring tugging existential messages that help me get through depression and to be a better human dream works and childhood movies
GetMotivated,not_removed,wonderfully put i couldnt agree more i was blown away that a jack black movie about a panda who does kung fu and its two sequels managed to be so deep and thoughtful ive also used quotes and lessons from these movies to help get through difficult times
GetMotivated,not_removed,linda like you cant make an omelette without cracking a few eggs i know its not meant to mean that but it still kinda fits with old tzus wisdom in an idiot savant kind of way edit grammar and punctuation are important
GetMotivated,not_removed,css is a pain in the ass ive been doing it for almost ten years and its never been fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes your doppelgänger
GetMotivated,not_removed,i literally watched this last night with my friends and this line specifically hit me too
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think it just got added to netflix which is why everyone watched it yesterdaytoday myself included
GetMotivated,not_removed,in my opinion the trick is to work with people that are willing to pay a premium for a job well done if you do the job well especially in the marketing world everybody is happy i am not advocating for somebody that knows nothing to pretend they can do something i am advocating for somebody with a base of experience to not be afraid to challenge themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,youll fail then youll learn something from it then youll try anew then youll fail then youll learn something from it then youll try anew then youll succeed suddenly becoming better than what you were
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have much learning yet grasshopper
GetMotivated,not_removed,i prefer the sentence fake it till you become it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the medium does not make the advice any more or less legitimate just like calling a magnolia a shitfart flower doesnt make it smell like a shart life lessons can be taken from anywhere in life i mean they arent called situationallyspecificlessonsthatmustbetaughtusingamediumasseriousandworthyastheadviceitself are they
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you need a hug
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you have a teacher in something and hes humble ask him how many times he has failed even if he has any funny stories of it you would be amazed how this unreachable peak was once falling on his ass like you are
GetMotivated,not_removed,i definitely think about this a lot as im learning the guitar i know i suck but i also know that sucking is the first step to getting better and if i keep practicing there will be a day when i can play the way i wish i could now
GetMotivated,not_removed,explain
GetMotivated,not_removed,mario green mario
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty sure this was confirmed in the live action movie
GetMotivated,not_removed,chai tea rio grande river los angeles angels
GetMotivated,not_removed,i noticed this due to the dozens of chinese martial arts movies ive watched and them frequently using the word shifu
GetMotivated,not_removed,wu gui is turtle
GetMotivated,not_removed,not really correct what you call your instructor is 傅 meaning teachertutor also i know its very popular to say kung fu to anything related to chinese fighting in western culture but the correct term is martial arts so it would be a martial arts teacher and not a kung fu teacher
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think thats the joke always thought it was weird
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the explanation
GetMotivated,not_removed,im confused in chinese your fellow students师弟literal definition is brother of the same teacher 师妹literal definition is sister of the same teacher under the same shifu are your brothers and sisters not the one teaching you your shifuteacher师父literal definition is teaching father is the father
GetMotivated,not_removed,nah id never call my father in law or a relative shifu in modern china and the biggest part of its usage is probably outside of martial art context its master or skilled artisan and its also used as a polite form for a bit set of professions when you want to be nice heck here in sichuan everyone calls taxi drivers shifu it became some kind of modern equivalent to dayiayi with non relatives specially if your in your where you dont fit anymore in the family calling gegejiejiemei mei and so forth source loving living in old school red neck china
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt that the case with every doesnt statement
GetMotivated,not_removed,sadly i think i am learning that the hard way
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty much the message of meet the robinsons congratulations you failed from failure we learn from success not so much
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,there has been a bit of flip flop about it but one of the creators of mario shigeru miyamoto confirmed that marios name was mario mario he confirmed this shortly after saturo iwata another cocreator who had previously said that mario had no last name died in july tldr marios name is mario mario httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimario

GetMotivated,not_removed,pizza pizza
GetMotivated,not_removed,what art do you practice as i know it the poster you responded to was right you call your kungfu teacher shifu or sifu pronounced surefoo or suhfoo respectively depending on where your teacher is fromwhat form of kungfu you are learningpracticing i dont know what art you practice if any but ive never heard of calling a master just fu or teacher shifu 师傅 has always been what i and others use its also not incorrect by any means to call kungfu kungfu wushu is the chinese term but its silly to say that kungfu is an incorrect term we use the word kungfu in our practice all the time although we pronounce it gongfu its just what people call it in the west and thats perfectly fine kungfu means hard work and thats exactly what it is to be clear im not trying to start an argument or anything here im just genuinely curious as to howwhere you got your info im not claiming to be an expert on all wushu or martial arts by any means ive just never heard of this before edit formatting
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i trained in shaolin kung fu in china my instructor was referred to as shifu as was every other instructor
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats great stuff how do you pronounce the chinese character where does wushu as a term fit in thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,kung fu 功夫 refers to martial arts in general be they chinese russian brazilian or whatever whoever is telling you that kung fu is specific to chinese martial arts doesnt understand chinese source 我说中文。
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think you are confused i think you are correct i know itsnot sister and brother it is like you said i am the who isnt a native mandarin speaker in my school and i am the who really sucks at it i base those numbers on a guesstimate of a people in my school there are only idiots who dont speak the language i couldnt find the pinyin but i think those symbols are correct i think you are right on
GetMotivated,not_removed,hahah i love this point about the taxi drivers when i was learning mandarin my teacher mentioned this and i thought it was so weird but when i actually moved to china it suddenly made sense xd
GetMotivated,not_removed,holy cow that is very different i married into a taiwanese family her father is baba only shifu is shifu one guy who is the giuy that opened the martial arts school no one else only when he is on his deathbed he appoints his successor as the next shifu and it will be someone who has studied with him since child hood very different usages of the word very interesting
GetMotivated,not_removed,its given me the edge on other people in the company however last two places ive worked people have called me the css guy and turn to me for help still not sure if that is good thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,he also said that hes bowser jrs mom so take that as you will
GetMotivated,not_removed,from the wiki nintendo did not initially reveal marios full name in a interview it was stated not to be mario mario despite the implication of the mario bros series title the first notable use of mario mario was in the liveaction film adaptation this was again used in two of primas official strategy guides in for mario party and in for mario and luigi superstar saga in after charles martinet voiced mario declaring himself mario mario at the san diego comiccon the next month satoru iwata said he had no last name which shigeru miyamoto agreed with the month after two months after iwatas death in july miyamoto changed his stance september at the super mario bros anniversary festival confirming that his name was indeed mario mario

GetMotivated,not_removed,department of redundancy dept
GetMotivated,not_removed,its ok im not trying to start an argument either though i do have my opinion on the subject as a half chinese guy who has been taught wushu since i was what i meant with what kung fu was that kung fu isnt actually what most people think it is a fighting styletechnique what most people mean when they say kung fu is wushu which is the jack of all trades in martial arts im talking straight from experience though as i have no real source for what i know i just talk what ive been learned im not really sure what you mean with wushu being the chinese term because both wushu and kung fu are heavily practiced in chinese martial arts culture
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually kungfugongfu here doesnt mean hardwork thats encompassed in another word with the same pronunciation in mandarin at least 工夫，although hardwork isnt the words only meaning either 功夫 is what the kungfu refers to here meaning more or less skillabilityworkmanship etc its common for people to be confused with the two words because their connection is like it takes 工夫 to get 功夫 on top of their same pronunciation also shifusifusenseixiangsheng depends as much on where you are from as where your teacher is from and what sorts of kungfu you are studying however translations can never be perfect so please correct me if im wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are wrong i dont think this is accurate some pronounce it shee foo and wushu is martial arts in general not just kung fu
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are wrong i dont think this is accurate some pronounce it shee foo and wushu is martial arts in general not just kung fu
GetMotivated,not_removed,i took his kung fu as wushu and since ive trained wushu i shared my opinion on it
GetMotivated,not_removed,you pronounce it like fo or fu wushu is considered by many martial artists to be what the western culture see kung fu as so wushu would be what you really mean when you say kung fu kung fu doesnt really have anything to do with fighting it just means that youre good at something wushu is the jack of all trades when talking about martial arts since it has styles from all different martial arts its like the father to traditional fightingstyles
GetMotivated,not_removed,you missunderstood the comment try rereading it
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah for the in laws we also use direct relation they have with the spouse at least that is very common and simple once you got the hang of different denomination depending on the side fathermother the uncleaunt etc is on gets weird when those direct links are used outside specially the random parents using uncle shuhsu 叔叔 to refer to you to their kids most of my elevator rides with families and a kid involves a 给叔叔hello literally say hello to the younger brother of your fathernever translate chinese literally ffs d
GetMotivated,not_removed,id read something once that if you make yourself have a skill nobody else at a company has you make yourself indisposable which is a good thing but also a bad thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,super smash bros ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks it was early in the morning and i forgot how to quote things so i just typed it out
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats just cruel
GetMotivated,not_removed,firesign
GetMotivated,not_removed,ah ok i think i see what youre saying my point was that although kungfu does not literally mean martial artswushu thats still what it meanshow we use it in the west basically i was saying that in the west wushu and kungfu are interchangeable terms even if this would be considered incorrect in the east however that is my experience with the word i suppose i dont think either of us are wrong i find kungfu to be an acceptable term to use in the west but i could see how you disagree
GetMotivated,not_removed,hm very interesting i will be honest with you i believed these characters to mean the samei was originally taught that they both meant skill or skill achieved through hard work and i assumed that the difference was arbitrary now i know that they have other meanings attached and that this is how to draw the distinction serves me right i should have known better since i studied mandarin for a time i learned something today so thank you for your corrections my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wont say that nobody has ever called their master sheefoo but to the extent of my knowledge this is incorrect the only instance i can think of sheefoo being used is kung fu panda surefoo is difficult to pronounce for kids so it was changed to sheefoo however traditionally the i sound in the word shifu makes an r noise besides even if some do pronounce it shifu it doesnt make my other points also incorrect surefoo and suhfoo are still common pronunciations i understand that wushu in the east refers to many styles and is somewhat different than what westerners think of as gongfu i also understand that in china wushu may honestly im not even sure of this be used as a name for martial arts other than chinese arts however my point was that in the west this distinction is arbitraryif someone in the west uses the word wushu instead of gongfu they are almost undoubtedly referring to what we consider gongfu thats all i meant though i do see your point edit clarification
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha studying etymology is what i do when im supposed to be practicing vocabulary ive never known so much about a language i know nothing about d as i get older im not getting smarter im just getting more creative about being lazy

GetMotivated,not_removed,technically youre not using the equipment wrong youre just messing around with one of the chairs
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey buddy could you get out of the painters scaffolding
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope you know how to sit at a chair at the gym
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont sweat it im not a fan of people who criticize how others use equipment i could get on half of the machines and look really funny doing something that is totally working my biceps
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah best way to injure yourself for good source my shoulder hurt after months off the gymyup
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would really match your flair
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you want to drive your point home with it wear it all day with your head through the sleeve and your arm tucked in your pants bonus points you can masturbate and no one will know
GetMotivated,not_removed,wearing the shirt would defeat the point of the quote though
GetMotivated,not_removed,from my it experience i think some end users are doing the thing from the picture
GetMotivated,not_removed,you must have been annoying to work with
GetMotivated,not_removed,the problem is between the chair and the keyboard oh yeah says the user then does the thing from the picture xd
GetMotivated,not_removed,but where to
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pioneers used to ride these things for miles
GetMotivated,not_removed,ha ha ha okay you spontaneously made me laugh tonight you win
GetMotivated,not_removed,eet iz vary danjrous and cud atek et any time so ve must deel vid eet
GetMotivated,not_removed,heres howhttpimgurcomempmigw
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mean that it wasnt from the start news to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure youd let your own daughter do that
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sure the can be creative without damaging themselves the floor or their furniture
GetMotivated,not_removed,i find myself wanting to correct my son and show him the right way to do things i need to remind myself to let him explore and figure it out on his own or to create a new better way to do something
GetMotivated,not_removed,the way i perceive it is some people think youre doing something wrong because it is not the way they prefer to get it done there are people out there believe that if they dont understand something then it has to be wrong classic narcissism
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think it means try what you think is a correct way and dont worry about what other people say because you dont have to tell them what youre trying to do if you are doing it wrong as in the picture its okay and now that youve laughed at yourself or the picture stop your bitching and go try ps by trying youll also eventually find a right way
GetMotivated,not_removed,i blew it up some details look a little strange but i hope it works
GetMotivated,not_removed,please do youd be an awesomer teacher
GetMotivated,not_removed,let me tell you about rasterbation
GetMotivated,not_removed,electric forest
GetMotivated,not_removed,but what if their intent isnt to sit in the chair
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do you know he was trying to sit
GetMotivated,not_removed,what is reddit xd is it like google ultra
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is us politicians
GetMotivated,not_removed,so youre not doing it wrong but you look like a dweeb got it thanks reddit brb back i was doing it wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,no i just seem to find myself ending up in that taxpayer position a lot
GetMotivated,not_removed,just dont do curls on the fucking squat rack
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha okay so what have you tried so far well i tried this thing with my chair that seems to make things work sometimes wat
GetMotivated,not_removed,woah woah woah lets slow down with all the details here one thing at a time
GetMotivated,not_removed,he rides for gondor
GetMotivated,not_removed,straight to the moon
GetMotivated,not_removed,i see no gold by his commentso what did he win
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sure i would because i used to too
GetMotivated,not_removed,there are people out there believe that if they dont understand something then it has to be wrong classic narcissism on the other hand there are lots of people that incorrectly think that they know what they are doing or are some form of expert that infact are making whatever it is theyre doing harder or are getting poorer results this upsets me because i end up having to correct their screwups
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes i try to do things differently to increase efficiency and someone always feels like they need to show me how to do the task i just nod and smile while thinking fuck off ive been here six months i know how to whatever the fuck i was doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,or just alcoholism god damnit frank get of that chair
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what you do with chairs or if wrestling is any indication you hit someone with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think its like disney channel
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were back really quickly like not even time for the to appear on your comment i am starting to suspect you lied to us
GetMotivated,not_removed,had to google it
GetMotivated,not_removed,people actually do this
GetMotivated,not_removed,how come
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh look the i totally know lots about the gym comment how original
GetMotivated,not_removed,the king in the north
GetMotivated,not_removed,really
GetMotivated,not_removed,genuinely curious howd it end up
GetMotivated,not_removed,amen to you brother
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you explain what you mean or give an example just curious what youre thinking
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me its more metaphorical for life as a whole as an individual experience nobody can say youre living your life wrong because none of us have any idea wtf were doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,my old gym partner seriously did this also httpswwwredditcomrcurlsinthesquatrack
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh captain my captain
GetMotivated,not_removed,painful death
GetMotivated,not_removed,i once worked in an office where the admin team had an older lady working for them that had a unique system of managing her correspondence she would paste all the emails into a word document then delete the emails then she would type out her responses below each pastedin email text block then she would take each of her responses and paste them in to new emails paste in the address of the recipient and send them off she furiously resisted any suggestion that she use her email client the way it was designed to be used in her mind she was an experienced administrative assistant that had devised a brilliant more efficient way of handling inbound email correspondence in reality she constantly copied and posted the wrong information and often left emails unanswered sometimes she sent people the text that they had sent to her back to them other times shed get the email address wrong and send people answers to questions they never asked occasionally she just completely confused people by sending them the text of an email she had received from another person
GetMotivated,not_removed,now lets all agree to never be creative again
GetMotivated,not_removed,but is he okay now
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds like she sucks
GetMotivated,not_removed,woah there friend youre gonna need to slow down
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly i always kinda thought this was just a subreddit for lazy people to kinda maybe think about going to the gym today
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly like many things in psychiatry the distinction between lazy guy in a bad mood and clinical depression can be blurry the fact of the matter is you can do things to mitigate depression whichever one you have exercise diet meditation a social life working towards goals will improve your condition if anything i think this sub gives too much credence to the i cant do anything about it its just like having a broken leg crowd friendly reminder an irrational sense of hopelessness is a symptom of depression
GetMotivated,not_removed,all these subs have drama smh i just look at the pictures go aw how nice and keep scrolling its not that serious
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be honest this isnt the depression or the recovery sub this is the get motivated sub it would only be wrong to say this stuff included in this sub if it was actually geared towards helping mentally unwell people recover i have a combination of mental health issues which affect my day to day life and make things more difficult than get out of bed smile and think happy thoughts but i dont really get offended or annoyed at the stuff on this sub as i dont come here for advice on how to deal with my problems i dont feel its aimed at people like me and i dont think you cant apply blanket statements on how to get inspired by life to people with complex mental illnesses and other issues people will take what message they want from the language and phrasing of motivational statements and they can be interpreted many different ways and so i think the real issue here is that people are thinking they are being doled out simplified advice on how to handle their lives and illnesses when really its just untargeted statements that could influence or motivate anyone who might need it i do think that people posting about how they cured their depression need to be a bit more careful with their language though with us cyclicchronics its a lot more difficult than a change of attitude and a getgo outlook keeping that in mind the stuff in this sub can continue to inspire people without coming off as patronising or upsetting to anyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,yo psych major in her final year of university here for clarification purposes the line between lazy guy in a bad mood and a person with clinical depression is not blurry i felt i had to reply to your post because sorry to be so rude this attitude where severe mental health problems are not taken seriously for a number of reasons including the attitude that oh i know what its like ive had bad days ive had a bad week is very damaging clinical depression is a disorder characterised by major neurochemical imbalances that result in extreme feelings of emptiness meaninglessness and worthlessness it is not the same as being lazy though i can understand that from an outsiders perspective there are definitely observable similarities in any case those with diagnosed depression know who they are and know which camp they fall into hopefully theyre in agreement with ops advice and do not take their temporary shortcomings with relation to the ability to motivate themselves too hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,overwrite
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is nothing special about you but dies
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this you get a lot farther in life if you realize that no one will come drop a golden future in your lap you plot your own course and you set off to build your life and yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be fair does anyone really think there are prophecies and legends about their coming
GetMotivated,not_removed,died from the dreaded anime mother disease
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am a golden god
GetMotivated,not_removed,does anyone else thing this is an alternate start to guardians of the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this movies and books lied to me or i let them colour my world into thinking there is something owed to me nothing is owed to you but everything you do is something
GetMotivated,not_removed,alright im not going to lie if my mom told me this on her deathbed id be pretty pissed
GetMotivated,not_removed,not to be that guy butim pretty sure at the age this kid is supposed to be hes not gonna understand the poetic promise or whatever his mother is saying hes just gonna understand that his mother just told him he was nothing and worthless and that she left him nothing which is gonna translate into she didnt care about him thats pretty fucked up to be honest this isnt motivating at all because life isnt the movie this comic strip would come out of
GetMotivated,not_removed,i got goosebumps from this strip as well because of how many times its been reposted
GetMotivated,not_removed,my mother died of cancer days ago one of the biggest things ive learned is that the passing of someone you love doesnt necessarily happen the way we expect like the comic above there was no last speech no dying words no by her side moment where she slipped away calmly a few days prior she was weak but talking then the next day less then the next day less in mumbles then unclear through the medication if they were even really words then a full day of her alive but mentally gone tldr the point is while i like the comic and it is very touching dont take for granted that youll have this bedside moment in either role because death can be pretty ugly say these things today
GetMotivated,not_removed,rimfourteenandthisisdeep
GetMotivated,not_removed,shes pretty high
GetMotivated,not_removed,fucking lame op
GetMotivated,not_removed,if she died after the you are you and nothing more comment this would have a totally different meaning edit better assholes
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone diagnosed with an aggressive latestage cancer mere weeks after his son was born i relate directly to this this is much an assessment of her own lived life as it is an direction to him a few days after i was diagnosed i wrote my wife a letter and included the following as i write this charlie is perfect and never made a mistake days will come where this will be less true he is ultimately responsible for the man he will become and it is our job to simply love him no matter who he becomes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i will defeat the monkey man and save the fith dimension
GetMotivated,not_removed,you dont get anywhere without the help of others no matter how close to nothing you come from
GetMotivated,not_removed,this bull shit is the worst you dont need to become someone you already are success is not something you go out and work hard to achieve that is a load of bullshit our society does too much as it is its time to take a step back and look inward find real success be successful it has nothing to do with what you go out and achieve wanting to be recognized by other humans as better than them at one thing or another is the root of so much suffering and is illusory in the first place edit spelling and grammar sorry everyone it was a mobile input thanks for letting it slide
GetMotivated,not_removed,even if his setting was in the ghetto or on mars he would owe his successes and failures to the environment he grows up in and the genes he was born with
GetMotivated,not_removed,it wouldve been funny if she died before she finished and he became super depressed knowing his mother said he was a nobody in her last moments
GetMotivated,not_removed,two problems with this actually you arent doing it on your own youre doing it on the shoulders of your parents their parents the society you live in very very few people are genuinely in the position of starting from nothing even if you are genuinely starting from nothing and doing it all on your own life isnt really a meritocracy sure work hard try your best etc but the reality is that a huge percentage of people do all of that and life is still shit source take a look around your towncity if youre in that boat and there are a lot of us this cartoon can be the very opposite of motivating
GetMotivated,not_removed,kid looks healthy to me he earned that or was he provided it
GetMotivated,not_removed,any time i accomplish anything impressive my dad always says you get that from me negotiate a good deal ahh youve got your fathers negotiating skills find a really good bargain youve got my eye for deals push myself to get a project done youve got my drive catch the eye of a beautiful young lady ahh youve got my charms a little bit is funny but its starting to wear on me it seems like more than poorly expressed pride maybe im being oversensitive but i feel like hes trying to rob me every time meanwhile he does very very little in his life
GetMotivated,not_removed,calm down sartre
GetMotivated,not_removed,except your very existence means you survived the universal pinball game of life
GetMotivated,not_removed,is this loss
GetMotivated,not_removed,this isnt motivating at all if you get goosebumps from it post it to rfrisson
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this really speaks to me as the father of a seven year old daughter i often find myself trying to express this to her but never seem to be able to express it quite as clearly as id like great post thanks for sharing it
GetMotivated,not_removed,repost
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is dumb
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know ive met a great many extraordinary people and have been shocked not by how different they are to me but how similar it might not fall to each of us to accomplish great things but everyone has the potential to be a great person our own greatness is just a matter of perspective
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol this was someone trying really hard to write a sad comic and not really hitting the mark comon guys this is just silly
GetMotivated,not_removed,the realist i needed this
GetMotivated,not_removed,damnit hows it raining inside
GetMotivated,not_removed,the artwork matches the dialogue
GetMotivated,not_removed,though this isnt so nice if you grew up just a lil smidge better than the people around you i bet those trailer park kids dont care about the huge advantage they have on all those starving ethiopians but then theres those of us who grew up as their neighbors a few miles away and had the mistaken impression that we were the wealthy people because no one told us that there were that many truly rich people until the internet and such let us know too late in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,my mother would praise me as being special when i was growing up she would tell me that i was destined for greatness my brothers would tell me that i was going to be the successful one of the bunch i had that shit plague my head for so long thinking i was just going to fall into greatness took graduating with degree jobless for months living with my parents and becoming a stock boy for a year while doing odd jobs mowing snow shoveling etc to realize that there is no such thing as destiny and that if you want something you have to work hard for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,this does nothing to get me motivated this just makes me more depressed sorry i just dont understand regular people and how they can be so happy or how something like this comic can be uplifting its like trying to comprehend dimensional space
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpportsherrycomcomicsoriginstory
GetMotivated,not_removed,meh id prefer a prophecy and some riches over some self determination and hardship
GetMotivated,not_removed,avenge me
GetMotivated,not_removed,you failure you no doctor
GetMotivated,not_removed,god this is horse shit try being with someone you love as they die
GetMotivated,not_removed,imagine if she died right in the middle of the comic strip
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a sad and selfish way to die your life ends and she by her words sets him on autopilot to depression dejection and destruction however if he is my kind of guy her bitter words will be just the propeller he needs to prove every single one of those depressing sentences wrong and achieve monumental success
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just want to add this because i hear a large amount of comments like these where im from how life sucks and everyones out to get me and ill never get ahead i live in a small town that has a booming economy because of tourism however unemployment is very high and business cannot find keep work it just baffles me because ive had so many jobs in this area all have been great jobs with great pay anyway at all these jobs i am always complimented on how great of a worker i am ive had many promotions pay raises and bonuses whats crazy is im not that great of a worker being completely honest here i do not deserve a lot of the recognition i get but you know why all my bosses have loved me over the years because i come to work thats it thats all they are looking for is loyal workers they will kiss your feet and shower you with gifts if you just work i think its sad because i see so many people complaining in my area that they cant find work i literally went online one night indeedcom applied for my current job and was hired the next day this is just my own views and opinions though not trying to sound rude another thing about where im from high school students can get their first years of college for free if they complete high school there are even year universities that will pay for you to get a bachelors degree if you just go to school seriously a golden opportunity and you know what people in my area still dont go to college then they complain about how poor they are and how theyve never been given an opportunity to succeed i dont get it in my opinion people pave the way for their future in their minds its like they are dead set on failure and they love to chuck it up to some imaginary force that is ruining their life umyou are ruining your own life dont pass up opportunities
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh i cringed from this comic strip
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hate inspirational comics and this subreddit on rall sod off get filtered
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,so thats the background story of the vaultboy
GetMotivated,not_removed,alternative beginning to guardians of the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,goosepimples shudders
GetMotivated,not_removed,we can resign to our fate but we cannot admit defeat
GetMotivated,not_removed,that kid grew up to be frank grimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,this would be a pretty disappointing ending to the hospital scene of guardians of the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,this sort of reminds me of the beginning of guardians of the galaxy i expected her to give him an awesome mix
GetMotivated,not_removed,port sherry pedros a really nice guy weve been friends over twitter for a while now go check out portsherrycom if you like his stuff
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep pretty much sums up the philosophical drive of our time which is a kind of soft relativism this must be part of the reason why this strip is so relatable we accept and flaunt the creed that the most honourable stance is honesty towards oneself thus uncovering a set of personal values and subsequent consistency in adherence to and defence of these this is in breaking with the enlightenment period when man generally thought that he could uncover universal truths through a kind of empiricism the comic strip celebrates this philo stance to the t and also has a strong message of heroism another key note of our era yeah all this just for the sake of considering what might be at play when one feels really touched by this art
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think its awesome some people are born on third base and pretend to have worked for it so hard its a lot more admirable when your born on first base and achieved things all by yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,i promise myself i dont cry promise broken
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for posting this im in the final stages of trying to complete my phd degree the second person in my family to attend any level of college beyond high school and the first to pursue any graduate level of education fixated on the memories of what i come from i constantly struggle with the next step forward i also lost my mother to a car accident when i was and i watched her pass in a similar manner so this comic really opens the wound to fresh air it provides a little something to grab as we fall through the pit of uncertainty thanks op
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have this concept in mind every time i start a souls game with a deprived character
GetMotivated,not_removed,wish more little bastards saw it this way
GetMotivated,not_removed,the idea was good but i dont think she needed to be dying i feel that maybe if the kid kind of initiated a normal son to mother conversation at home or something it would make more sense i just dont think her being sick makes much sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,i swear this comic strip has been reposted like three times in a few months
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn it i was certain i wouldnt feel anything and i got goosebumps too ya got me poster ya got me
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminded me of guardians of the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,rgetmotivated more like get emotional
GetMotivated,not_removed,source
GetMotivated,not_removed,its too early in the morning for me to feel such feels
GetMotivated,not_removed,kek america is the only country that teaches the lie that you can become anything you want to if you set your mind to it tell that to japan
GetMotivated,not_removed,everytime this gets posted i just feel its so depressing its not motivational at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,how is this motivating this is pretentious and only insightful to kids with a limited amount of life experience i would hope that most people realize this by the time they graduate high school
GetMotivated,not_removed,the day you realize that you are not a snowflake but instead are a cog is the day you will be a better neighbor a better child a better parent and an asset to your community
GetMotivated,not_removed,excuse me but this did not motivate me because i suck at coming up with my own thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is depressing and i disagree the person who created that illustration must not have children because children will make you see otherwise
GetMotivated,not_removed,cringe bumps
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually genetics and centuries of evolutionary programming does pose a limit to what sort of behaviour you are most likely to do plus if you dont get the proper incentive from your environment you are likely to never tap into those predetermined potentials if anything you arent destined to be great but rather you are destined to not be certain things over others oh and that kids mom telling him hes free thats like morpheus forcing neo to choose between red and blue pills you dont really have the choice to not choose either kinda like how this kid star lords dying mom took away his freedom to learn those things on his own
GetMotivated,not_removed,i lost my mom when i was she was a single mother for years of which my dad was in prison it was just her an i and she did absolutely everything in her power to raise me the best she could if that meant working hour weeks in a factory all year she did it it will be years in february since she passed she passed in her sleep and there was no closure which for me was the hardest part not being able to say one last i love you or goodbye since then ive found that the best way for me to cope is to pursue the dreams that she encouraged me to follow i find that the harder i work the more focused i stay the more determined i become the more i feel like she is proud of me slowly ive come to realize that every lesson big or small that she has taught me about life is now coming into use she preached patience hard work tolerance and selflessness all though i am not even a fraction of the amazing person she was i see these traits that she has taught me are not only helping me cope with her passing but also helping me achieve my dreams and that is all she wanted for me she prematurely lost her sister her mom her father and her cousin all within a short amount of time sometimes i think the lessons she taught me she had also learned from her own experience of loss i watched her grieve on every single anniversary of their passing as i child i could not comprehend that feeling of loss in hindsight it is incredibly inspiring to know that despite everything she went through she stayed strong and persevered and never lost focus when most people might fall apart so for those who have lost someone close to them and are having trouble coping my best way of coping is working towards my goals because i know thats what she wanted for me the person you lost wants you to be happy create a path for you if there isnt already one and if there is thats okay too and you will feel your lost loved one with you every step of the way at every milestone and celebration
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is basically a way shorter version of guardians of the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes i fantasize in all the ways i could die id never have the balls to actually off myself but its nice to think about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,wife and i can relatewe both come from nothing poor families no assistance in life weve both worked hard our entire lives and accomplished our goals weve come a long way from sharing a one bedroom apartment with our daughter in a bad area of the city to buying a beautiful home in the suburbs were not rich by any means but everything we have in our life we worked very hard for and we got it ourselves and i can die happy knowing that
GetMotivated,not_removed,but hes a fucking white male
GetMotivated,not_removed,same
GetMotivated,not_removed,this for some reason reminded me of an alternative universe where star lords mother told him this and he never runs away and lives a normal life
GetMotivated,not_removed,next page of comic the father comes is with his new baby sister
GetMotivated,not_removed,anyone else getting starlord vibes
GetMotivated,not_removed,wasnt this just posted a week or two ago
GetMotivated,not_removed,the struggle is real
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyday ordinary people do extraordinary things
GetMotivated,not_removed,for a moment there i thought it was peter quill and his mother
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats deep
GetMotivated,not_removed,so fry is starlords brother
GetMotivated,not_removed,rip
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive always loved this train of thought its like cooking if im not predestined to eat a specific thing then i can eat whatever i want i can make tacos ramen chili pizza salad whatever
GetMotivated,not_removed,this would have been awkward had she died before the last line poor kid
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone tell me about this app how i can use it pls
GetMotivated,not_removed,mama may have and papa may have but god bless the child who has his ownwho has his own
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i have to say i like this post more than most not feeling any need to mentally balance the ideas contained
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a very good point but maybe id have maybe dropped that particular truth bomb some night after dinner or something save i love you very very much or you have been the light of my life for the whole deathbed thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,you got goosebumps thats weird i got sweaty eyeballs
GetMotivated,not_removed,bam right in the feels
GetMotivated,not_removed,this actually made me tear up a little it speaks to me so much
GetMotivated,not_removed,good thing she got that last bit out before she died
GetMotivated,not_removed,well its good that she didnt die panels earlier otherwise that wouldve been a downer
GetMotivated,not_removed,feelsbadman gun
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need an edit where she dies after she says you are nothing and the last panel is the son drinking his depression away just as god intended
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just saw this as dammit im not going to hogwarts or another dimension nor am i going to be batman or spiderman lame
GetMotivated,not_removed,this makes me appreciate the death of parents calling their kids rock stars for every little thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,would suck if she died right after she told him he wasnt special
GetMotivated,not_removed,well he at least went on to be star lord so he has that going for him
GetMotivated,not_removed,motivational and feelsvillian 👍
GetMotivated,not_removed,shit now i wish i was a mere peasant like you guys
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a scene by scene of guardians of the galaxy d editbrb gonna check myself for autism
GetMotivated,not_removed,somewhat unrelated but it reminded me of a more hopeful version of
GetMotivated,not_removed,my mother had toxemia and almost died at my birth so did i everything that this mother is and wanted to be every ounce of her love every milestone and memory is condensed into this moment she cannot give anymore than that she has to be enough for the rest of her childs life in this one single moment before her death that to me is the purest definition of a mothers love it cant be measured in time or over a given lifetime sometimes all of it needs to be there to be given at that moment life depleted love eternal
GetMotivated,not_removed,wanna cry for half an hour httpimgurcomdvegq
GetMotivated,not_removed,almost reminds me of guardians of the galaxies beginning
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive seen this like times now
GetMotivated,not_removed,the freedom of zero obligation to anyone elses standards is incredible
GetMotivated,not_removed,mkay imma need you to stop being a little debbie downer now kay

GetMotivated,not_removed,horrible
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey bro can i bang your mom real quick wh dude she she just died well uh yeah thats the way i like em
GetMotivated,not_removed,i saw this on community except it was a letter to a man from his dead mom instead of a dying mom with a young child i thought it was funny on the show bc the guy was already grown up and it seemed more timely in his life as he was a self centered asshole it loses its effect with a young kid getting the same speech now its the mom who is the asshole my moms last words to me were that im nothing special but that i would own my own ordinariness thats something to pass on to the grandkids someday
GetMotivated,not_removed,this rough but a great piece of wisdom from a dying mom to her son
GetMotivated,not_removed,welll that totally depressed me
GetMotivated,not_removed,that hand grab wouldve freaked me out irl

GetMotivated,not_removed,it gave me eye cancer
GetMotivated,not_removed,what kind of shit is that to say to your kid before death why
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck thats a good one i wasnt prepared for that
GetMotivated,not_removed,how is motivational you can do anything you want wow now i can take on the world
GetMotivated,not_removed,later that evening he was abducted by space mercenaries and underachieving starlord was born
GetMotivated,not_removed,shit im a grown ass man tearing up at his desk cause of this
GetMotivated,not_removed,nah anything they accomplish is still a product of all of their experiences and environments being mediocre doesnt mean you have causeeffect shattering superpowers in fact id say that it is not mediocre for a dying mom to say this shit to the kid on the deathbed that is sure to be a spur for example
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mean my path was to make goddamn french fries
GetMotivated,not_removed,too bad everything is monopolized so youre likely not going to own anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,technically his mind will development with a collected inheritance of humankinds knowledge from which to build upon which is cooler more honest and more inclusive of all humanity isolated individualism is not really the best perspective
GetMotivated,not_removed,im going to be that guy as much as i support hard work and effort its never their own efforts or their own true effort there are exceptions like that guy who dug through a mountain because his wife died httpsenwikipediaorgwikidashrathmanjhi he is an exception an exception but its more like this httpdigitalsynopsiscominspirationprivilegedkidsonaplatepencilswordtobymorris
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre right mom i can fly and that was how he ended up in the same hospital minutes later
GetMotivated,not_removed,this reminded of community when jeff remembers what his mother told him as a kid
GetMotivated,not_removed,i went into this like bitch i wont get no goosebumps there is no path set out for you fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is an upside and a downside to everything the trick is to avoid the upsides that are easily ignored and strive for the downsides that take effort to be conscious of
GetMotivated,not_removed,im still shaking i cant even
GetMotivated,not_removed,god is dead god remains dead and we have killed him how shall we comfort ourselves the murderers of all murderers what was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives who will wipe this blood off us what water is there for us to clean ourselves what festivals of atonement what sacred games shall we have to invent is not the greatness of this deed too great for us must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,now get out mommy needs to rest before her boob job
GetMotivated,not_removed,lpt when dying give the tldr first and elaborate after
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,you make your own path son but it isnt destined for great things
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry morty but youre as dumb as they come
GetMotivated,not_removed,my butt is special mom
GetMotivated,not_removed,this comic is dumb as fuck that mom is a bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read that last sentence as you plot your own curse thats not what i want
GetMotivated,not_removed,just about every kid in the world privileged or not needs to understand this
GetMotivated,not_removed,wouldnt it be awful if she died at the panel
GetMotivated,not_removed,and when you finally get to the top and feel content with who you are somebody comes along and tells you that you dont understand their struggle and were given everything in life i know this from personal experience it doesnt bother me that they feel that way about me it bothers me that they feel compelled to ridicule someone elses success what happened to those people that they could look at a comic like this and feel inspired but look at a successful person and feel angry
GetMotivated,not_removed,but you still need to recognize who helped you and formed you no man is an island
GetMotivated,not_removed,even if you are fortunate enough that you will have a golden future its important to live your life as though you will not
GetMotivated,not_removed,but why plot in the first place
GetMotivated,not_removed,or you are born into money have a trust fund earn figures off of your investments and are given a cushy sales job at an international computer company because of who your grandpa was that guy got pretty far hes not happy regularly cheats on his wife who he thinks is a golddigging bitch loves his kids very much which is why he stays with the golddigger and im pretty sure he is alcoholic
GetMotivated,not_removed,they will however drop obstacles
GetMotivated,not_removed,imagine if she had died before the part of her speech poor guy lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,makes it that much sweeter and rewarding to know you control absolute
GetMotivated,not_removed,i learned this lesson at age im now and the work has only just started but you know what i love the work
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyone should aspire to be the hero of their own story
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a millennial i think the biggest disservice that was done to our generation was for our parents and teachers to constantly tell us that we are special and we can be anything we want to to be neither of which is true in my opinion the better thing to tell kids is that they are not special they are no better than anyone else and the only way they are going to get ahead in life is by working hard i know it sounds harsh but it is the cold reality of the world
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think that is the main problem with some millennials they think they are a special snowflake entitled to greatness but when they go out to the real world they see its different and get disappointed and depressed because they dont know how to adult
GetMotivated,not_removed,that golden fortune is a seed the person who gets it still has to do a lot of work
GetMotivated,not_removed,you plot your own course tucks in shirt sits down crossing the right leg over the left points forward with two fingers engage
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read the second sentence as golden furniture what a very specific reference
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres billion of us if we all had precious and wonderful stories that are ready to open before us if we just muster up the courage and pick ourselves up by our bootstraps we would all be doing it in truth we value stories like that because they are so rare not because they are so common real life is mostly mundane and boring
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless youre white then everything you do will be attributed to privilege
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a path but too many of us are staggering about in the dark unwilling to seek it and without hope of ever finding it
GetMotivated,not_removed,there was once a guy in bethlehem that had some prophecies about his coming
GetMotivated,not_removed,author u poemforyoursprog when i was young i quickly found the hardest truth to bare was learning life the world around is rarely just or fair i used to dream of luck and love of once upon a time of plans arranged and mapped above of reason truth and rhyme the world was good and i would fit where i was meant to be that just as i was made for it the world was made for me but now i know my dreams of youth were simply that a dream and plans are far removed from truth no matter how they seem there is no phoney final line there is no plot or plan no crafted perfect grand design but living while we can so if you wake to tears youve cried then try your best to cope for still there lives a dream inside and that my friend is hope
GetMotivated,not_removed,not so much as that but most people at least at young age get to listen things will fall in place on their own youll find love sooner or later god has a purpoe for us all etc
GetMotivated,not_removed,idk i might be jesus
GetMotivated,not_removed,my grandfather died the week i was born i am named after him he was a singer and the family has albums he made i am a singer im told i sound and look just like him this year i release my album im i have his name that feels fated to me and my family
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive known more than a few that act like it i dont hang out with friends like that for long
GetMotivated,not_removed,i found a cool rock with some inscriptions on it in my attic still working on what it says though
GetMotivated,not_removed,not necessarily to that extent but ive come by a lot of people who truly act like theyre gods gift to the earth even though most of them literally amounted to nothing at the end of the day
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe not using those big words but think about all those people with shit jobs that vote against their interests because one day theyll own the farm
GetMotivated,not_removed,the american dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,every dude in an action movie
GetMotivated,not_removed,an ex of mine did his mother had been told by some weirdo that her son would change the world and she was unwise enough to tell the kid last known working in a warehouse somewhere i think i wonder if the delusion persists
GetMotivated,not_removed,that kid grew up to be the boston ripper
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyone wants to belive that they are special that there is something more about them it may not be destiny but if they themselves make themselves something more isnt it just the same
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes most people its what movies have pounded into our heads our whole life
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a young kid under the protection of your parents and before life has had a chance to demonstrate thoroughly otherwise you just might
GetMotivated,not_removed,i kinda used to results of a delusional and fantastical mother that truly believed she was gods mouthpiece on the earth now it seems absurd but if all you hear since you were a baby was that you were going to be a great leader and really save the world you dont really have a choice but to believe her not a bad thing really thats why i say i kinda used to
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes its a common delusion in our society that one is special
GetMotivated,not_removed,jesus thought that
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be fair i became king of atlantis due to a prophecy so i think there is some merit to that idea
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a five star man
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am dio
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are a bastard man
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am a biotic god
GetMotivated,not_removed,and you can tell rolling stone magazine that my last words wereim on drugs
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am the lizard king
GetMotivated,not_removed,and you can tell rolling stone magazine that my last words were im on drugs no wait i dig music im on drugs
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty sure this is a scene in community
GetMotivated,not_removed,i instantly thought of peter quill
GetMotivated,not_removed,alternate as far as i remeber its word to word
GetMotivated,not_removed,i honestly thought i was in rstarwars and this was hans origin story
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing is owed to you but once you figure out your path you realize that those books and movies were true and that that chosen one was never special and is usually this kid but in this moment realizes he can be the best at whatever it is he does those people are usually your steve jobs your jesus your mlks or your jackson pollocks
GetMotivated,not_removed,growin up this realization felt like i was so much less than nothing when i felt like i needed that thread of hope that i could have something magicalgrand about me waiting to be unleashed the realism of life depressed me at that point could you blame a girl who grew up in a stressfulabusive home and bullied in school wanting to be special was a need to fill the void of neglect and tormentas an emerging adult i had to redefine grandeur in a new perspective here i am workin towards making a attainable dream come true into a reality
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you can say that now until your mother is on hey deathbed saying this objectivity
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think its because parents really shouldnt talk to their kids like this
GetMotivated,not_removed,not even an i love you anywhere in this yeah this is bs
GetMotivated,not_removed,because she died that would piss me off too
GetMotivated,not_removed,it spent too many panels saying negative things you can say all that in panels and get the message across
GetMotivated,not_removed,im so sorry for your loss
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am sorry for your loss i nearly lost my dad to a stroke two months ago he was at the stroke unit under heavy observation luckily his mental faculties were largely intact thats when i told him everything i could think about it was the most honest moment between us as we didnt know what the next would bring i realise now what mortality truly means and how fortunate i am to have had that experience i now call my grandparents weekly now i didnt do that before and let the months and years slip by dont wait to tell your loved ones how you really feel dont dwell or fret about what they might think the time is now not when they are almost gone
GetMotivated,not_removed,its going to be okay im sorry
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive watched several of my elders go this way so i know a little something about the strength it takes to have experienced it the road ahead isnt easy the death of a loved one means the death of a part of yourself and god knows that part is enormous when it comes to our parents you will have to find the courage to be alright with moving forward with becoming a new person to fill in the spaces within that could only ever belong to her and you will in time dont be afraid to feel good again when youre ready the best times you shared with your mother were when you both felt good and she would want you to feel that way now i know sometimes it almost feels like a sin against your loved one to look at the future with optimism or to smile when theyre not able to be here anymore its a human tragedy how a heart can yearn to linger in the familiar sadness for one gone by mourn for as long as you must but not a minute longer your mother lives in you what she was is in your blood who she was is in your heart
GetMotivated,not_removed,i came looking for this
GetMotivated,not_removed,not yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,this sentence was a little confusing lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,im really sorry man if i may suggest record yourself if you can with a message to your son i guarantee you he will treasure no other material object in his life more than that recording
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks everyone ive been in treatment for the last months had chemoradiation surgery and am now doing more chemo as part of a larger treatment plan the goal is actually to cure me which not a lot of people can say about cancer treatment well find out in if all this worked if anything i think ive got a bit longer with my son than i thought i would have when i was originally diagnosed
GetMotivated,not_removed,me too but that sounds a little hard why dont we start smaller
GetMotivated,not_removed,well said
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think it is backwards the front that is often put up to save face in society is misconstrued as the goal when in actuality such success is only good when it is a manifestation of selfactualization the wanting to be recognized is such an important point rather that we wish to really be something than only perceived as it
GetMotivated,not_removed,no all you have to do is believe and try try try if youre failing or have failed it was your own fault most people
GetMotivated,not_removed,but because you have something called will then that shit is irrelevant just as long as we find your wish acceptable then it should all be fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,not to mention that being an average nobody is not a prerequisite for being able to be proud of your accomplishments that whole verbal beat down was totally unecessary
GetMotivated,not_removed,your success is still dependant on your parents social class the country you were born in and the education levels of your parents
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh thanks mr edgy poster
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone who has lost both their parents before the age of and built a life for myself this is motivating that being said im thankful that it doesnt resonate with you it means you didnt have to deal with a situation like this and thats a good thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is just a regular comic coming from a long line of other regular comics that wasnt destined to be anything special but carved its own path in life and became something truly of its own
GetMotivated,not_removed,right there with you came up with about five different plans for my life in college thinking each would be easy to achieve saw all five of them blow up in my face in less than three years time in the same time frame saw my old man one of most successful folks i can think of lose jobs one due to the shop closing its doors another to the money not coming in quick enough to pay the bills he was self employed for the second one and the third cause the owner skipped town while still owing my old man more than usd the owner didnt even have the guts to tell my pop in person the shop was closing my dad learned that when the state investigators showed up looking for the owner this crap along with other shit caused me to end up with a severe case of depression and to drop outta college thanks to meds my extended family and a number of counselorsdoctors im back to normal at the end of all this i saw an ad in a paper for a local community college that was offering a might course in a field that would let me help folks fours on im back on my feet in a field of work i love and im back in school to get the next level of licensing for my field so yeah maybe if i hadnt been told i was destined for greatness i might have done better my first time out of the nest
GetMotivated,not_removed,omg they need to make an asian version
GetMotivated,not_removed,free college where are you
GetMotivated,not_removed,were not here because were free were here because were not free there is no escaping reason no denying purpose because as we both know without purpose we would not exist god damn that trilogy had some awesome dialogue
GetMotivated,not_removed,you lot are so fragile
GetMotivated,not_removed,youll get used to it
GetMotivated,not_removed,no it means making french fries is all youve accomplished all the credit all the blame its all on you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i leave you little money because of my boob job
GetMotivated,not_removed,my friends mom actually got a boob job and thats exactly what she looked like after i wouldnt be surprised
GetMotivated,not_removed,that would be such a nice ending to the comic end it with the kid holding up his moms new double fs like a freshly caught whopper fish
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes this is why you dont wait to tell people meaningful things this one point
GetMotivated,not_removed,but how else will this comic leave an impression if its not said at someones deathbed
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know youre just kidding but ive always found it interesting how in the last few hours of our lives our continued existence is almost completely sustained by our emotional and mental state ive had quite a few family members where their last wishes were to say goodbye to everyone or maybe have a talk with their husbandwife or children and pass away almost immediately after mind over matter is the real deal
GetMotivated,not_removed,because it doesnt happen any one out there had something like this happen id like to hear about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,lpt or dpt
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like how you made the monitor flatline too nice detail
GetMotivated,not_removed,would that fall under find what you love and let it kill you
GetMotivated,not_removed,in its own way that is strangely deep
GetMotivated,not_removed,well equally accurate generally
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyll fare better if they understand that the concept of free will is and always has been a fantasy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with this so much i came from a poor family with a lot of kids at a pretty young age i learned to fake it til i make it it doesnt cost anything to comb your hair straighten up your posture and walk with confidence or to practice speaking like the educated people on tv and radio do to mimic the demeanor of more successful people just those few things can give you a valuable head start then you add some hard work to the courage to keep trying instead of giving up and now i hear things like yeah but you were born rich or you dont know what its like to have to work really hard for things
GetMotivated,not_removed,im happy for peoples successes but i think most of us have at some time encounter a bullheaded wealthy person who assumes that everyone else can or will have the same experience they did it is difficult to avoid becoming resentful when you are exposed to a lot of people like this its a struggle to the top and not everyone is able to find the path some people get stepped on along the way some people make it the path is much easier for those born wealthy but a lucky few poor people are able to find it and reach the top i have a friend who grew up initially in poverty until her family made it when i was struggling to buy a house she suggested i look in the wealthiest most expensive part of the state to find something she also assumes that when shes out of grad school she will be able to just stroll in and get a loan for and she probably will and then not understand why others cant i think its extremely important to remain humble and to never forget the community that has allowed you success or the people who remain at the bottom and as long as capitalism persists there will always be people at the bottom
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know you or particularly care about your particular situation so please only take this as personally as you deserve generally when i see complaints like yours the story is that the person in your shoes has either failed at empathy or simply cant seem to acknowledge impediments that others face and their potential impact more often than not this is someone who worked really hard but was advantaged in ways they fail to admit and are holding their relative success over a group of people different from them take a throwaway line like just comb your hair and consider that for some people the best hairstyles to keep their hair clean and neat are considered inappropriate for work while the other options require an investment in time and money that they may need to spend on more basic needs one of my favorites is when this complaint is wrapped in my family instilled x in me while discounting the struggles of those whose parents were absent due to work drugs or prison who did not have fluent english speakers in the house didnt know competent readers had criminals or abuse in their household etc worse some people are like the barry switzer quote some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple tldr if you think its your success people are ridiculing perhaps youre not really hearing them
GetMotivated,not_removed,people arnt upset about success but rather those who use success to supress the opportunities of others
GetMotivated,not_removed,who is john galt
GetMotivated,not_removed,what alternative would you suggest
GetMotivated,not_removed,hes got long hair works as a carpenter has a lot of crazy ideas about love and brotherhood his names gunther and hes dating my mom sometimes he buys us beer
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know that guy had god complex written all over him
GetMotivated,not_removed,and when he did come he came harder than millions before him and billions after
GetMotivated,not_removed,i saw that porno it didnt end the way they said it would
GetMotivated,not_removed,he didnt come in that prophecy
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i think someone wrote a book about him or something
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn heshe is so good i havent read one ive disliked
GetMotivated,not_removed,username may or may not check out
GetMotivated,not_removed,no youre not
GetMotivated,not_removed,albums
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah did you mean album
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know lots that go to music school
GetMotivated,not_removed,temporarily embarrassed millionaires
GetMotivated,not_removed,something about the rabbits and an alfalfa
GetMotivated,not_removed,that kid looks to be around so she made it pretty far for having a shonen character son
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were expecting a bright future but kono dio da
GetMotivated,not_removed,but great wind biotic god im i what was i saying im tired
GetMotivated,not_removed,im happy for you buddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am too though i cant remember when it happened anyone have any idea
GetMotivated,not_removed,who
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like jackson pollock too but wow what a weird inclusion with steve jobs mlk and fucking jesus hahaha
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the secret ingredient in my secret noodle soup
GetMotivated,not_removed,this might be the most meaningless upvoted comment ive seen in
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree it is a rare and genuinely good parent who has the courage to prepare their children for reality this would be a far better world if young people were separated from their delusions of grandeur earlier it is when were young that were in our most powerful frame of mind that education has its most potent effect to deny a child the bruised egos of reality is to deny them said reality altogether growing up hurts and theres nothing wrong with that
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love you isnt always necessary in fact its sometimes a bit trite i never hear it from my parents because theres no need we know and there are other more meaningful things that can be said
GetMotivated,not_removed,well whatd you expect someone literally stole or i guess the whole idea of the series and then made a shitty comic about it and then op didnt even give them credit for making the comic basically how all of culture works though
GetMotivated,not_removed,some moms kills their children or is that bs too
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel that your feeling might be highly localized
GetMotivated,not_removed,could you grab me something from the top shelf yknow because youre reaching anyway
GetMotivated,not_removed,you kind of sound like a narcissist yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,would you feel better if your parent told you that the world owes you somethingthat youre bar of gold when in reality youre nothing but a piece of coal let me tell you a secret no one owes you shit unless youre born with golden spoon in your mouth you are what you make yourself to be sooner you realize that then better so stop bitching how shit your life is has been take the crap as it comes and deal with it too harsh to comprehend tuff fucking luck deal with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup this is true
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats one strange fetish you have
GetMotivated,not_removed,this i have never heard my fathers voice i know nothing about his demeanor nor the cadences with which he spoke its these casual things i miss the most theres no shortage of great minds to give me lifes big lessons theres no dearth of helping hands in my life what i dont have is just the simple man he was he died a few days after i turned and though i have a pretty remarkable long term memory its not that remarkable dont agonize over what to say dont try to be socrates just speak plainly and from the heart the idea is to give yourself to your child
GetMotivated,not_removed,defeat isis and save the third dimension that sound any easier
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a middle ground environment and genes have a huge impact but if youre born in a first world country and have internet access there arent many opportunities that arent available to you itll be harder but you can do most stuff people like you just love to make excuses and pretend everythings impossible so you dont have to get off your arse and try
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think dependant is a bit strong of a word in that instance related maybe
GetMotivated,not_removed,captain cynic awayyyy
GetMotivated,not_removed,no man is an island
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha yeah it did folks at the time were like thats all popphilosophy bullshit i was like hey man better than any other popculture bullshit right but no honestly for the watchowskis to use popphilosophy in a friggin action blockbuster was genius theres an entire generation of people who grew up relating to neo because it spoke to that sort or angsty rave culture but then theres an entire generation of people who watched those films as a kid and are now grown up and we love it
GetMotivated,not_removed,anything you accomplish anything you become will truly be because of my boob job

GetMotivated,not_removed,most sane people love sex and nobody wants the hiv
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone make this into a poster
GetMotivated,not_removed,the concept is not a fantasy but inside brains that are continually sheepherded by media its passé
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow are you me this is exactly how i describe my life i define the poor not poor line by food stamps i guess its a wic card now and i grew up on food stamps its why i dont complain much about paying taxes other peoples money kept my family alive when i was a kid so now im returning the favor
GetMotivated,not_removed,we could legitimately be brothers haha i came from a poor kid household where we ate tomato soup and toast for dinner more times than i like to admit i pretend i fucking pretended my way through the military i pretended my way into a government job i pretended a lifestyle that drew friends to me i never lied about my skills but selling them to someone else was really difficult for me pretending to be a standup guy got me ahead in so many situations being told nice suit when you got it for from goodwill and affordably tailored by a local mom and pop shop feels nice the suit may have been cheap but if it is worn with confidence it will be appreciated be that suit in reality i am quiet mild mannered and aggravated by any minor amount of inconvenience at work i am approachable friendly and always willing to take on something new i learned to be this way by watching successful people and aspiring to be like them
GetMotivated,not_removed,okay ben carson were on to you just kidding thats awesome and good for you for achieving what it is you achieved
GetMotivated,not_removed,unfortunately many get so proficient in faking it that even forget to make it in my career i have met many somewhat successful people making it by just faking it going back to the comics this is a message more for the parents many of them still pushing their own dreams on their children
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have also been fortunate to exceed my families station in life but was given something much more valuable than money a work ethic and an appreciation for things my father was a middle class gut who felt rich because he had all the essentials house car food clothing and a loving family he used to tell me that he was likely happier with his sears flannel shirt than some rich guy in suit i am often told how lucky i am for what i have but luck was only a small part hard work and good planning were the keys
GetMotivated,not_removed,my parents who have a decent amount of money have consistently voted conservative been against minimum wage hikes welfare health insurance etc now that their kids are working long hours and making very meager wages they just cant figure out why things didnt turn out better what people dont seem to understand and what bothers me about the its simply because we worked hard attitude is this here in the us we treat any unskilled laborers as if theyre crap wages arent so great for them and benefits can be nonexistent yet somebody has to cookdeliver your food clean the schools watch the gas station and stock the grocery store those people might be on their feet all day doing a job they dont enjoy the fact that they didnt go to law school or get a highpaying job which many people get with the help of connections doesnt mean they didnt work hard note i dont work one of these jobs im a researcher but wages are low these days
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed after my mother died nearly all of my close friends abandoned me but would often appear to tell me to stop being so selfish and to count my blessings and understand that yes yes its so difficult watching your abusive mother die after having to look after her through her last year and losing all your life savings because you inherited her legal fuckups and you almost lost your apartment because she comitted benefit fraud in your name but there are real problems in the world like having your boyfriend cheat on you i eventually fell out with my friends because i got fed up of the way they kept letting me down over and over when i needed them the most and then demanding that i acknolwedge all they had done for me and to support them through their anguish over relationship breakups and disappointing tinder dates they just dont get what its like to grow up in an abusive home or to grow up poor and when i point that out to them they fly into a rage and tell me that im being bitter and need to understand they have it just as hard right now i went out on a date with a really hot guy it went so well and then went sour so now i feel even shittier with a major case of blue balls guy was doing the whole open relationship thing and then felt guilty about it and now im sitting here wondering why nothing in my life ever goes right now matter how much effort or not i put in i always get the same results i just really cant stand people anymore and always seem to make everyone hate me from my family to my friends to anyone i go out on dates with so i think im not going to go outside anymore i really wish i could be normal and get to go to parties and go on dates but i think i have to accept im meant to be alone and should put the void left by my former social life to good use though i need to figure out how to do it so other people are not involved i hate being alone but other people just dont like me when im quiet people say im boring when i talk people say im annoying and tell me to shut up again i just hope one day i find people who will love me for who i am and dont make me feel ashamed to be myself every time i open my mouth
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dunno whenever i see people who had the luxury of living at home until their mid twenties and only moving out when it was convenient for them to do so with also the safety net of still having family to catch them if things go really south and then bragging about their loving parents on fathers and mothers day all i feel is jealous rage they didnt earn that happiness
GetMotivated,not_removed,as long as man exists there will be a bottom what i mean is people are individuals would you be comfortable with the lazy fuck who smokes dope all day having the same life as you who works hrs a week and drives a ten year old camry so you can save tuition for your kid to go to college some people are on the bottom and its right where they should be for the effort they put forth others will always be there due to ability some folks just dont have it
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea theres a lot of stepping stones to the finish line and some people start at closing stepping stones than others
GetMotivated,not_removed,did you get better at filtering out irrelevant info the more you practiced i understand luck is a key part of success but so are forethought and planning today computers are big so im a cs major but steel was big when andrew carnegie was growing up luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity roman philosopher seneca no matter the circumstances people who plan and adapt as you have will continue to get lucky im glad you have had success and part of it is chance but you were prepared when others werent whether thats their fault or not and i think you owe yourself more credit for using your time effectively to prepare either way congrats on your successes and continue to prepare i also understand a quote doesnt provide solid evidence that i am right just citing a individual who was thought highly of to add ethos to my argument
GetMotivated,not_removed,i understand what you are saying and respect that but my situation was never a start on third base one if we are using baseball analogies which are often pretty good i am speaking from the perspective of a guy who started by watching the game by hiding in the bushes outside of the park never thinking he would have a chance to play and yet managed to hit his first home run despite that fact people will still tell me that i was on third with bases loaded and someone smacked a homer for me as if they know my situation success is enjoyable and ill never let those opinions bare down on me but it is annoying that so many look to stories of success as inspiration and to the reality reality of success as oppression
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea but the vast majority of people just make horrible decisions and wonder why they cant get ahead
GetMotivated,not_removed,seconding this meritocracy is a myth
GetMotivated,not_removed,there often is a tendency to label all success as that
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know thats why im asking the question im sorry if i come across as trolling but i genuinely dont understand why people do things i feel like its something to just be accepted rather than understood but i dont like that answer so i genuinely ask why looking for a genuine response

GetMotivated,not_removed,cmonughstarlord
GetMotivated,not_removed,just referencing great people in their fields
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats also subjective
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is not reality it is not sufficient to simply state things that may taken on their own are true what also needs to be stated is their contextual meaning what a thing actually means in application without it you will depress and demotivate a kid and doom them to nothing because in the way the world is setup right now being not special is very very bad you are not special is a put down children respond very very poorly to put downs from their own parents its effectively a message that their parent doesnt love them i knew a lot of kids who had parents giving them messages like this often about how the kids are not worth anything how they need to work hard to earn their place etc these were usually not very loving homes filled with parents whose life didnt work out so well so they tried to pass that message along in an odd way this was often an excuse for poor parenting methods and bad resources the kids that i found did the best were those that rejected that message who said that something better was possible who said that no they were special and they were worth something more because at the very least you should be special to yourself even if you were one of the unlucky ones who was not special to their parents perhaps you are born special but you can lose it over time you have ideas and dreams and they get buried by the dark forces that some refer to as reality reality mulls you together and turns you into homogeneous mush that will do its bidding but it is not from buried ideas and defeated people that we get true change it is not the kid that heard so early on that hes worth nothing that we get true change it requires some degree of living in a world that should be rather than the one that is you dont know what someone is or what theyre going to be able to do to kill a persons attempt to imprint themselves upon the world so early on is a crime and all a parent that tells a child theyre not special is doing is committing that crime it is not for you decide whether one will be special
GetMotivated,not_removed,mantises
GetMotivated,not_removed,savage af
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a large space in between these two extremes i dunno like saying something nice or insightful on your deathbed the comic does sound like a narcissists last attempt at control to be honest
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn you told him
GetMotivated,not_removed,i came looking at this too
GetMotivated,not_removed,not really to be completely honest
GetMotivated,not_removed,mommys gotta look good for the funeral

GetMotivated,not_removed,the real death pro tip is in the comments
GetMotivated,not_removed,rdeathprotips oh wait thats a thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,in any situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,bukowski
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed probably better than being killed by what you hate eh
GetMotivated,not_removed,death by snusnu
GetMotivated,not_removed,i never lied about my skills fake it til i make it well you two which one is it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love tomato soup and toast my girl and i had grilled cheese and tomato soup for lunch just yesterday the thing i tell myself and did even when i was growing up poor was we werent really bad off i mean by us standards we were well below the poverty line my dad brought home a week we had food a roof a loving family and an atari although not always a tv or cable tv when we had one most poor in this country are rich to a few billion others
GetMotivated,not_removed,we are cut from the same cloth my friend my life pretty much exactly im now going on
GetMotivated,not_removed,if nobody does anything than yeah they made their place i was thinking more about those who think that the person who works two jobs in fast food and janitorial doesnt deserve to pay rent and looks down on their hours of labour vs the observers hours of investment banking or living off of the return on investments and not even working
GetMotivated,not_removed,did you get better at filtering out irrelevant info the more you practiced its hard to describe i feel like part of my brain processes it and as long as it starts off being somewhat successful it gets more successful over time yeah it has some drawbacks to but thats a different subject i understand luck is a key part of success but so are forethought and planning today computers are big so im a cs major but steel was big when andrew carnegie was growing up luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity roman philosopher seneca right no matter the circumstances people who plan and adapt as you have will continue to get lucky disagree completely luck is things outside of your control that you cannot change youre trying to talk about something thats not luck im not sure what the word for it is its just not luck im glad you have had success and part of it is chance but you were prepared when others werent whether thats their fault or not and i think you owe yourself more credit for using your time effectively to prepare either way congrats on your successes and continue to prepare i also understand a quote doesnt provide solid evidence that i am right just citing a individual who was thought highly of to add ethos to my argument lol one of the weird limitations of language is that i find it almost impossible to discuss both internal attitudes and big picture logic for success at the same time i have a term i call self fullfilling prophecy if its possible for you to be successful having an optimistic attitude that you will be successful actually makes you more successful however if its not possible for you to be successful in your situation youll be a lemming throwing yourself off a cliff lol its weird you have to mix in the emotional push for success but also the intellectual smarts to track your odds of success and hold back from running off the cliff just because you hyped yourself up about how you can fly
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you sure it wasnt success is what happens when preparation meets opportunity maybe its someone elses modified version of the quote eh edit nvm your quote is from the roman guy mine is from some nfl hall of fame coach
GetMotivated,not_removed,i completely agree that i do not know your situation i do wonder where in your update of barry switzer you put those kids who would have seriously been asking perilousall if they were siblings because their family was broken apart or were hiding in the bushes not to see the game but because some member of their family was looking to exploit them sexually etc again i am not doubting your hard work or that youre much more successful than your origins i am probably asking you to acknowledge that there are huge differences between having tomato soup and toast for dinner more times than i like to admit and going to bed hungry and to the soup kitchen so often that everyone in gradeschool knew my point being that when someone acknowledges that significant numbers of people and identifiable groups of people had more things to overcome than them and expresses some reasonable emotion regarding the inequality suddenly the conversation where they feel attacked changes into something much more positive there are surely people who are just looking for excuses are prejudiced against you or are just haters in general but as someone who routinely knows people on both sides of complaints like yours usually no one is happy about the interaction at that point its not that i think you should attend anyones pity party but rather to point out that failing to acknowledge that pull yourself up by your bootstraps presupposes so many things that its easy to find someone to take offense and the implied like i did tends to make it personal before anyone bothers to notice edit skipped an important not tldr heres one weird trick for avoiding the annoyance of people sniping at your success
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats also very subjective i come from a bluecollar family where my parents grew up poor but raised me lowermiddleclass im a bit better off than my parents i own a house but i could not survive on a single fulltime job like my family did because of the economy but i grew up under extremely different circumstances than my peers we were lower class hold outs in an extremely wealthy area so i went to school with multimillionaires same schools but very different home lives and support networks
GetMotivated,not_removed,a lot of people dont have the guidance to know that they are making a horrible decision had i known then what i know now i wouldnt have gone to college after high school i would have gone to trade school or hell even art school and pursued my dream since that would be about as valuable as most bachelors degrees seem to be these days you cant make a good decision without an informed choice you cant make an informed choice without the knowledge some people have it innately some learn it some people struggle to find it at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,not really though
GetMotivated,not_removed,most likely because given enough time it evolves into that power corrupts and all that shit yada yada
GetMotivated,not_removed,we have one chance at life we are born we live for a short while and then we die and no longer exist we are alive now we can choose what we do and how we live we have the power to interact with other people and interact with our environment we can create and build things do interesting things see things experience things and try to understand what it all means the question shouldnt be why should i do anything but rather now that i am here what should i do with my time what reason do i have to not do anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,what is it that youre asking exactly it seems to me that youre asking why one would attempt to control ones own life which seems pretty self explanatory
GetMotivated,not_removed,i used to work bending girders but i couldnt live with myself once i learned that the girders were being used to make suicide booths
GetMotivated,not_removed,well thats uplifting
GetMotivated,not_removed,he can turn a box into wine
GetMotivated,not_removed,said the andalite you guys arent much better than the yeerks
GetMotivated,not_removed,i used to hate jesus because from my agnostic perspective theres no reason to believe he was the son of god because theres no evidence for it so really he was just some egotist calling himself god but damn he actually was a pretty great person you know i think being egotistical is the only negative quality he had
GetMotivated,not_removed,was my favourite sung by uindiefied
GetMotivated,not_removed,similar subject matter but not even close to being exactly the same thing it was something like youll be good at some things but youll suck at many more
GetMotivated,not_removed,relax man its cool to have a code name its not that weird
GetMotivated,not_removed,who
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt think it was a clever response at all it was a response seems like youre a bit bored and want to find fault in an innocuous comment on the internet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought it was pretty good
GetMotivated,not_removed,it reflects a delusional level of self importance on the kid
GetMotivated,not_removed,what i dont understand is why do people always think that shitty upbringing and childhood is only exclusive to them growing up i was slapped in the face with harsh truths of life on daily basis alcoholic stepfather never at home mom working as many as jobs never at home when they where all hell broke loose abusive relationship alcohol violence drug abuse ive seen it all preaching to the wrong crowd here i understood how world works wery early i never looked for sympathy never will i took it all as it came dragged myself up yeah there was no one to raise me i pity those who feel sorry for themselves only because momy or daddy didnt tell them how beautiful they are enough
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey man youre absolutely right people who have not experienced deeply dysfunctional upbringings are frequently limited in the understanding they can extend to people like yourself they may make perfunctory gestures of empathy it sounds like your childhood was terrible but they want to get back to ignoring your experience as quickly as possible but you cant expect a terrible childhood to let you off the hook bootstraps etc you werent acting like anyone owed you anything you werent suggesting you were a bar of gold yet thats how dickless decided to characterise your comment deal with it jesus fucking christ that tells you everything you need to know this person is so quick to diminish another persons struggle so they dont have to modify their world view remind you of anyone hint narcissist
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats sad and all but it doesnt make him wrong though it probably could have been worded a bit less like something hanging on the wall in a suburban gym locker room
GetMotivated,not_removed,screw that im eating a pound of unpopped popcorn
GetMotivated,not_removed,what
GetMotivated,not_removed,plenty of deathbeds hiding just out of plain sight

GetMotivated,not_removed,bukowski might have said it but steve irwin lived it
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been doing this for years with alcohol
GetMotivated,not_removed,i loved harambe
GetMotivated,not_removed,god thanks i am reading this motivational book which starts with his life and redditing in the meantime and this comes up kinda creepy actually
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,wouldnt that be more natural though i would hate to be killed by the one thing i love
GetMotivated,not_removed,ignore that just be yourself bullshit and learn to sell the skills you have never lie about your skills but you may have to lie about your personality
GetMotivated,not_removed,i for one do believe it is moral to expect a wage that allows a roof and food without food stamps for your efforts i dont necessarily think that should be a hr week for caviar expectation it is also the way it is that society assigns more value to a doctors hrs a week than a janitors they will never be equivalent exaggerated example uses to highlight my point
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think youre looking for just world fallacy and selfefficacy for your last paragraph self efficacy belief that you can bring about things you want via your own efforts just world fallacy it doesnt matter how hard you work you may not get what you sow thats how the cookie crumbles this comic may play a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,depends on who is making the statement and doing the labeling any number of people do exactly that just as on the other side of it some will dismiss everyone who doesnt have a pricey tract house and a car in top repair as a noaccount drifter
GetMotivated,not_removed,i suppose you have to have your mind made up about freewill in order to argue the merits of why one should or shouldnt try to control their life i think success manifests itself in many forms as many forms as there are people why would you look to and emulate someone elses success how do you know their success is like your success fake it til you make it yeah but its more important to build your own real success internally before any external success could be realized
GetMotivated,not_removed,ddd spoken like a true controller were the saviors of the galaxy dammit
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be fair im an atheist that enjoys the concept of jesus regardless of how much is real its also not proven that he ever thought he was the distinct son of god as in god had sex with my mom and made me theres no historical evidence that he ever told anyone that his mom had an immaculate birth or that he was a distinct son of god he was pretty adamant that we are all sons and daughters of god and that we would find eternal life in sacrifice for positive ideals im pretty sure that the jesus that we know or were taught about in catholic school was as much of the real story as a hollywood movie thats based on a true story
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn the story poem and song were all great well the contents of the story werent great but well written
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont get many epiphanies worthy of caps lockjust let me have this one man
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a poster from rraisedbynarcissists so did i not sure what all the hate is about in this thread
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hate every single one of you
GetMotivated,not_removed,im pretty sure that alone will kill you source i get real confident in my medical knowledge after a few beers
GetMotivated,not_removed,that would be jiffy
GetMotivated,not_removed,less shit to burn ends up saving a few seconds do a good deed for your cremation guy hes always got your back probs in a jar though
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would be more dark for me if my mother dies while telling how much of a failure im
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep jump in with both feet
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you havent already look up people living in manaus and other parts of the amazon messing with piranhas they look terrifying
GetMotivated,not_removed,is that kinda like the avenged sevenfold little piece of heaven song
GetMotivated,not_removed,and this is why no one will ever find my ex
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty sure youre on the list now good luck with thatmaybe theyll let you star in the documentary of the serial killings
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you dont its a dead meme next
GetMotivated,not_removed,more than creepy maybe its destiny
GetMotivated,not_removed,me too
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the surgery will likely not be successful if all the blood and guts and bacteria are left in the or after the surgeons are finished janitors play a huge and important part in our lives people just dont tend to notice or want to notice at least subconsciously and cleaning a hospital is an especially disgusting task my dad cleaned ors for a period and he has some stories
GetMotivated,not_removed,its all just supply and demand those jobs pay less because anyone can do them many of them can even be automated it has little to nothing to do with virtue our human worth
GetMotivated,not_removed,horkbajir lyf

GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck this commercial
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty sure boggle the owl is the originator for this one
GetMotivated,not_removed,the site linked by op made no mention of the original content creator source that being said it tears me up every time i read it
GetMotivated,not_removed,its probably because im a little bitch but every time i read that it brings tears to my eyes even when at your weakest youre still fighting
GetMotivated,not_removed,i translated it into german in case some german therapist wants to hang it up somewhere corrections are welcome ich mag das wort „hilferuf nicht wenn jemand zu mir sagt „ich denke über selbstmord nach ich habe einen plan – ich brauche nur einen grund es nicht zu tun dann sehe ich darin keine hilflosigkeit was ich denke ist deine depression hat dich jahrelang fertiggemacht sie hat dich hässlich genannt und dumm und erbärmlich und versager – so lange dass du vergessen hast dass das nicht stimmt du siehst das gute in dir nicht und du hast keine hoffnung aber – du bist trotzdem noch hier du bist zu mir gekommen hast an die tür gehämmert und gerufen „hey am leben zu bleiben ist gerade echt schwierig gib mir irgendwas zum kämpfen auch wenn es nur ein stock ist gib mir einen stock dann kann ich überleben was ist daran hilflos ich finde das unglaublich du bist wie ein soldat auf feindlichem gebiet deine waffe wurde dir weggenommen du hast keine munition mehr du hast lange nichts richtiges mehr zu essen gehabt und wahrscheinlich hast du dir irgendeinen urwaldvirus eingefangen der dich riesige spinnen halluzinieren lässt und alles was du sagst ist „gib mir einen stock ich werde hier draußen nicht sterben „hilferuf hört sich so an als sollte ich mitleid mit dir haben aber du brauchst mein mitleid nicht das hier ist nicht erbärmlich das hier ist der nackte wille zu überleben auf diese weise haben menschen lange genug überlebt um die zu werden die den planeten beherrschen ohne jegliche hoffnung ohne jeglichen treibstoff bist du bereit dazu dich hunderte kilometer durch feindlichen dschungel zu kämpfen mit nichts anderem als nur einem stock wenn es das ist was nötig ist um an einen sicheren ort zu kommen alles was ich tue ist dir einen stock in die hand zu drücken du bist derjenige der um sein leben kämpft
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have never seen this before but i love it as a sufferer of chronic depression this is uplifting in a way that people who have never been there will never know thanks for posting
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this a lot especially the part about being this way for so long that i think its normal sometimes i dont even think i want to get better because i have wanted so badly just to end it all because if i get better i no longer have an easy way out of it all but here i am in therapy every week just fighting with this stick maybe someday ill find my way out of the jungle if im this way forever well on my last day no one can ever say i didnt try we are stronger than most if only people could see a physical representation of the strength we gain fighting through a jungle with only a stick
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is fantastic i wish more people would view depression this way
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a therapist in training im absolutely going to use this thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,that hit me real deep and i am crying my eyes out right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,very nice and it catches the mentality of struggling with depression well weve all fought very intense very lonely battlesand were here to read this thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is the stick ill use in the future and i will swing like there is no tomorrow thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,man this has brought tears to my eyes i always viewed myself as weak for never doing it a coward etc this kinda puts things in a new perspective for me and i really should do my best to think in this mindset instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,staying alive is really hard right now is what i wish people who didnt experience depression could understand more often i fear pain and the unknown when i was depressed it wasnt that death seemed exciting or awesome it was that i had tried so long to be happy and be what i was supposed to be that i just did not feel like i had the energy or willpower to go on i was depleted and nothing i tried was giving me the motivation to live because nothing could pierce the pessimism and apathy that was caused by my depression
GetMotivated,not_removed,just sent it to people i love and care about
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought it was going to be the cat in the tree that says hang in there
GetMotivated,not_removed,these are powerful words that really speak the truth it means so much to sufferers thank you for sharing this
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is incredible great share
GetMotivated,not_removed,can i get two iron ore to go with that stick those huge spiders are rly kicking my ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been a sufferer of depression and anxiety for years recently started meds in the past i wouldve been a blubbering mess reading this its awesome and accurately portrays how i felt now i just want to say to every one that reads it and feels the same way that there is hope for what ever its worth this random stranger on the interweb knows what youre going through and is here for you if anyone wants a chat im only a pm away
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just need a reason not to do it i think people fail to see the resolve in that statement the ive clearly been processing this a lot in my head and weighing the balances and so far the ledger is not in my favor it sounds very attention whorey but it also translates to the fact that at some point you well may have genuinely thought out the processes and impacts youve considered how much it may impact others youve mentally composed your letters and are one shiny red button away from unleashing the emotional equivalent of an interdimensional squid monster on times square youre largely committed and begging in the most subtle way you know how to have someone wrench your hand from the console and stop the nukes so it doesnt look like you were not only weak enough to make the plan to begin with but so a failure you couldnt even go through with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i came to reddit tonight to ask if there is a inspirational quotes subreddit because im more than down saw this read it and it brought me to tears almost feels like weight off my shoulders with every reread its never how i or the people i interact with have looked at it i think im going to try and find a therapist hopefully but doubtfully i can afford one thank you op
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats amazing cant believe ive never viewed it from that angle before
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for sharing this
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a great quote my fav uncle ended his own life when i was a kid and i wish i had something like this to show him instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed to hear that i was trying so bad for years i have continued to get the message that my depression is my fault ive been in and out of counseling on and off medications and gym memberships i have researched and vacationed everything hearing from my therapist that i was working as hard as possible to improve meant a lot to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is glorious put it to music
GetMotivated,not_removed,great find
GetMotivated,not_removed,when theres nothing else survival instinct is your greatest friend this is pretty strong
GetMotivated,not_removed,been having a tough few weeks and reading this made me cry
GetMotivated,not_removed,having lost a friend recently to suicide i have to say i hope this truly doeshas saved people its just not worth it
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a psychotherapist irl i would like to express my appreciation for this post part of the art of psychotherapy is helping others feel understood in a way that resonates with them and that is much of what this post offers if you are considering going to therapy but feel reluctant i would encourage you to try it out it is far less scary than you might think though it usual provokes a lot of anxiety the first time many therapists use a strengthsbased approach like the one in this post and it can be immensely helpful in building self esteem and confidence to overcome ones symptoms
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing this i too have been having a hard weekend medication changes and trying to quit pot are taking its toll on me im living hour by hour and riding it out
GetMotivated,not_removed,this just shows that a lot of depressionanxiety is often just about perception or outlook i know its not that simple from within the mind nothing is more patronising then someone saying hey your just looking at it wrong cheer up but this shows that someone changing your angle slightly on a better course has a huge result in the futurem
GetMotivated,not_removed,first legitimately good thing thats ever been posted to this subreddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hate when people say depressionsuicide is a cry for help especially since there hasnt been any crying to begin with and no im not just referring to the act of physically crying even though i personally wouldnt want it anyways there is no whining in the world of depression unless you want the usual cliches and empty attempts at sympathy that is then again in the world of depression you really dont want anything to begin with so why would you want to cry for help or even better bring attention to yourself especially from the people that are more than likely already poisoning your life as for suicide it is just the last desperation to want something and that something is to end your universe and its suffering
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love it great words well put
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is great
GetMotivated,not_removed,when they ask for a belt instead of a stick you need to worry and this account is done
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you want to hear this again yes no
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive read this a couple times before cried then too all im doing is handing out sticks youre the one staying alive
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed this more than you will ever know thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thisjust changed my life
GetMotivated,not_removed,awwww i really like that as someone that has fought depression in the past and has won and has a happy life now i wasnt going to read itbut im so glad i did its such a wonderful way to look at things in a new light if anyone needs a stick i have some extras and will give you one
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would be a good analogy if you werent in the fucking jungle
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was just thinking the walls im my crisis department were looking pretty bare
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont like the phrase a cry for help i just dont like how it sounds when somebody says to me im thinking about suicide i have a plan i just need a reason not to do it the last thing i see is helplessness i think your depression has been beating you up for years its called you ugly and stupid and pathetic and a failure for so long that youve forgotten that its wrong you dont see good in yourself and you dont have any hope but still here you are youve come over to me banged on my door and said hey staying alive is really hard right now just give me something to fight with i dont care if its a stick give me a stick and i can stay alive how is that helpless i think thats incredible youre like a marine trapped for years behind enemy lines your gun has been taken away youre out of ammo youre malnourished and youve probably caught some kind of jungle virus thats making you hallucinate giant spiders and youre still just going give me a stick im not dying out here a cry for help makes it sound like im supposed to take pity on you but you dont need my pity this isnt pathetic this is the will to survive this is how humans lived long enough to become the dominant species with no hope running on nothing youre ready to cut through a hundred miles of hostile jungle with nothing but a stick if thats what it takes to get to safety all im doing is handing out sticks youre the one staying alive
GetMotivated,not_removed,didnt know i had depression until i read this and had a breakdown this helped me make progress good stuff
GetMotivated,not_removed,cheesy as fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep fucking fighting
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wish my dad had seen this
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,this make me shed tears
GetMotivated,not_removed,shivers
GetMotivated,not_removed,about to go into school psychologist office tomorrow to see if i have bipolar disorder any words of adviceinspiration
GetMotivated,not_removed,holy fuck the reposting is real
GetMotivated,not_removed,rfrisson
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me it is more like i dont have the courage to get it over with
GetMotivated,not_removed,so true but as one who has struggled with depression as long as i can remember its quite hard to see that you are a survivor depression whats that about
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow
GetMotivated,not_removed,selling sticks for
GetMotivated,not_removed,who keeps cutting onions near me
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was absolutely beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful read
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was a good read and i needed it too
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow thanks for posting this
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks this really helps
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is pretty fuckin powerful i feel fine and that still got to me somehow i could see how that would make someone feel like theyre able to push on i liked that thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have to do this every day i wake up and ask myself do you have even a single reason to keep going today
GetMotivated,not_removed,i did not understand a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,we became the dominant species when we were corrupted by greed and entitlement
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is nice and gives hope and encouragement yet being bi polar and having dealt with major depressive episodes basically it would do zero if i were in the midst of an episode i am a two time suicide survivor you can only understand what happens if you experience it like something takes over your brain and hell or high water cannot stop you from that final act i am now on disability after years of workingi take my daily medsget rest and try not to stress too much i do plenty of physical work around the house and exercise but somedays even going out on errands is very anxiety inducing to mei needed to make some photo copies of old pictures and havent use a photo copy printer in several years i became so upset so for people who call me unmotivated or lazy get losteven checking out at the registrar can induce a rather bad state in mei know these are not big challenging things to do just how crazy i am
GetMotivated,not_removed,this one is beautiful i hope my life can turn into giving people fucking swords to deal with their demons
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt think the comparison was very apt
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont like this first of all saying hey im in trouble give me something to fight with is literally asking for help it is how is there an entire article telling us that that isnt asking for help it is second theres no shame or weakness in asking for help the message should be youve been so strong for so long getting help is not a sign of weakness not youve been so strong for so long but dont worry you coming here for help doesnt count as asking for help so youre still strong just pretend youre not asking for help
GetMotivated,not_removed,im of perfect sound and mind right now and i could not for the life of me figure out what this statement was saying if you are depressed and suicidal this gibberish will do nothing but confuse you even further
GetMotivated,not_removed,when im at my worst im not looking for help from anyone but from myself this statement only applies to those attention seekers in my opinion i stay away from everyone when i feel hopeless no one but myself can change how i feel
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,i tried to draw this owli posted it so go find it somewhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,first thing i thought too boggle has a lot of good blurbs like this and the creator deserves a hat tip imo
GetMotivated,not_removed,udeadrosesandfire you might like this one
GetMotivated,not_removed,an owl wrote this
GetMotivated,not_removed,it take a big bitch to admit u a lil bitch proud of son
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i was already curled up in bed and sobbing for the third day in a row when i read this talk about the hysterics up in here right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,we can be little bitches together then
GetMotivated,not_removed,lets start a club types through a wall of tears
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not crying you are i totally teared up when i read this i was feeling suicidal two weeks ago i had a plan and everything for it thanks for pointing out that were still fighting at out weakest that really made my morning
GetMotivated,not_removed,whatever it is thats making you call yourself a bitch is the first thing that needs to meet your stick
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup was already crying in the bathroom at work almost was ready to leave stall back to snivelling
GetMotivated,not_removed,i highly recommend you check out boggle the owl as well as hyperbole and a half both have very good stuff on depression httpcomicsalliancecomboggletheowllovesyou
GetMotivated,not_removed,i spent many nights on the floor telling myself out loud its always better in the morning and it always was i havent had to struggle with shitty brain chemistry in quite awhile and it took my wife to help me find patterns i needed so that my brain could make something resembling healthy chemistry but man when it got really bad at times it was forcing myself to believe that the morning sun and its warmth had some power to save me every day its always better in the morning always
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope youll make it through its worthwhile and i think at that point you wont mourn that you have been in the jungle for so long youll just be glad you made it and that you can enjoy some well deserved rr i think you will also be proud of yourself for making it through at that point all the best
GetMotivated,not_removed,trust me you will get out of that jungle it may take awhile christ it took me years but it is heaven once your out the worst part once your out is rediscovering who you really are without depression and even though that it hard it so much fun d good luck with your battle if you ever need help or someone to talkrant to your welcome to pm me anytime
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly i remember a girl i knew in high school who had an extremely fucked up home life used to cut herself up and show people her scarred arms i remember my youth pastor rolling his eyes and saying she was just trying to get attention granted she was an absolute parasite who lied constantly but if someone is trying that hard to get attention something is legit wrong with them at the very least she needed someone to teach her how to ask for help in appropriate ways because she wasnt going to learn it at home
GetMotivated,not_removed,hugs hope you feel a bit better now
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks so much for this because its exactly what depressionanxiety feel like for me i function well until i feel like im dealing with too much and what feels like too much for me isnt that big a deal for most everyone else i know but to me it feels extra scary and threatening because i always feel like im on the brink of utter mental collapse im getting better now ive been in therapy and ive been reading a lot of articles about my particular problems and i feel so much stronger than before but really its just the shrinking away of my negative thoughts as i learn to ignore them and push past them to get shit done part of my motivation is to set a good example for my daughter she forces me to be strong even when i feel like shes actually making me more crazy sometimes p its been a tough journey and its not over for me yet but it feels so good being able to believe in my own capabilities again or maybe for the first time really anyway nice post
GetMotivated,not_removed,so if you keep saying shut up or trying to challenge them theyll just race faster isnt the basis of cbt about changing and challenging your thought patterns though
GetMotivated,not_removed,this song would sound awesome with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,they already have
GetMotivated,not_removed,in my experience therapy is being charged an hour to be asked how do you feel multiple times im sure therapy can help but what philosophies or programs can i look for to make therapy feel more worthwhile
GetMotivated,not_removed,hang in there
GetMotivated,not_removed,be honest and be willing i never lied to a therapist but it took me a long time to be honest about myself and willing to do something about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,both clinical depression and situational depression can be benefited by cognitive behavior therapy in fact therapy is often easier or more effective for people with environmental stress
GetMotivated,not_removed,a cry for help in regards to suicide usually means it is a pathetic attentionseeking ploy its insulting in a way people tend to see it as the person not having a real problem they just want the attention that goes with it thats why it is generally understood when a person is very verbal about suicide they are less likely to do it the people that dont talk about suicide have given up hope they dont cry for help because they thinkknow there is no help if those people are still alive at the end of the dayweekmonth it was a struggle for them to do so maybe they had a big stick
GetMotivated,not_removed,saying hey im in trouble give me something to fight with is literally asking for help it is how is there an entire article telling us that that isnt asking for help it is youre missing the distinction its okay i missed it too the first time i read through it there is a difference between asking for help to fight something and asking for someone to save you to beat the something for you the former is the right kind of asking for help the latter is something noone is going to be able to do for you with depression unfortunately when people say therapist or psychologist they expect the latter kind of like how you expect a doctor to treat your illness but depression is more like trying to lose weight a physical therapist can give you all the sticks you need to lose weight he can guide you through the exercise routines and plan something specifically for you but youre going to have to go through the motions yourself i am not saying depression is like losing weight depression is a sickness but the parallels in this context are more akin to losing weight than to having a cold
GetMotivated,not_removed,having been depressed and suicidal as a sort of recurring state of being i completely disagree with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think most people who intend to kill themselves are the opposite of attention seekers by definition suicide attempts can be a cry for help or attention sure but it must be pretty serious need for attention compared to say getting a tatoo or acting up when i was suicidal it was only the impact on my children that stopped me so i had to seek therapy in case even that was overcome there is no just in depression methinks
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,who
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a huge bitch edit
GetMotivated,not_removed,ma all the gods of furious strong be with you as you crunch opposents and live like a windrammer as you fuck

GetMotivated,not_removed,look some of my comments make me out to be a jerk but thats only accurate you need a laugh support anything etc and ill get back to you pm me any time seriously just ask yourself what you have to lose just give it a shot
GetMotivated,not_removed,im so sorry to read this big internet hugs
GetMotivated,not_removed,im on day three too i hope today is better for you maybe well both find sticks today
GetMotivated,not_removed,well in that case i certainly cant httpwwwupworthycomwhatsitlikelivingwithmentalillnessaskwilwheaton of uwil opening up about mental illness certainly didnt put me in tears on the couch nope no sirrybob
GetMotivated,not_removed,im happy youre still here good job holding on i know its not always easy
GetMotivated,not_removed,same herepast two days ive been with an immense emotional ache hiding in my bed and curled up in the bathroom the trick is to keep breathing a glimmer of light will show and you have to hold onto it with all you got
GetMotivated,not_removed,your good dude call me when you stay an entire week in bed without feeling anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,like prayer
GetMotivated,not_removed,evil stepmothers are such a real thing dad just was diagnosed w a terminal issue and she is being the worst person ever my moms stepmother also started seeing someone while her dad was in hospice then took of the inheritance which she blew w her new boyfriend youve already been through the worst of it though i cant imagine reflecting over that scenario ever gets easier
GetMotivated,not_removed,the approach you describe works remarkably well for some clients who default to not experiencing their own emotions and recover through insight and encountering their own repressed feelings though it might feel like only one thing is being said if your therapist is halfway decent there is a lot more going on timing and tact are the therapists two main tools an hour would be for out of pocket in some very well off areas the average out of pocket here in the midwest is insurance usually reduces these rates down to to per session if you attend a university most have free or inexpensive therapy at their counseling center community mental health centers often provide more affordable care as well others need more structured treatment for this a cognitive behavioral therapist can be very effective they often provide homework and in some cases like with some anxiety treatment will go with you to practice overcoming your anxiety these are often time sensitive so results are generally seen within to sessions depending on what is being treated
GetMotivated,not_removed,your missing the point if a cheap pick me up is what it takes to chase away the thoughts of suicide for that day then thats one more day you chose not to end your life people who have not experienced depression have no capacity to understand just how deflating and hopeless those feelings can get and a cheap pick me up for one day may just be enough to get you past those feelings allowing for a better intervention the next time live to fight another day and all that
GetMotivated,not_removed,arent we literally programmed to pursue survival until the last moment as far as i understood at least some psychological problems are the brains last attempt to cope with a challenge
GetMotivated,not_removed,well said
GetMotivated,not_removed,hardly a rational pont of view considering it is coming from a depressed and suicidal person
GetMotivated,not_removed,welcome
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like all sorts of things just let me know your interests and ill indulge you if i can
GetMotivated,not_removed,an owl
GetMotivated,not_removed,made me laugh after a bad day when i didnt really feel like laughing have an upvote my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,for a second i thought it was gonna be a charmed scene
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am yet to tame the wild little bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,i get the impression youre the exact person not to call if that happens have all the seats
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not a competition but if you are in bed for a week you probably could use some help unless you know your bedridden i suppose edit youre
GetMotivated,not_removed,yall must be so boring
GetMotivated,not_removed,skeleton ∞ doot
GetMotivated,not_removed,i often recommend mindfulness activities it doesnt change situations but it does help with seeing things more clearly and to reduce stress i often listen to the exercises at httprodaledigitalbookscommindfulness the book that goes along with it is very good
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell me more please like to think ive educated myself on depression as i too get very depressed please advise brains last attempt to cope is a new one on me
GetMotivated,not_removed,gotta ask why you thought that though
GetMotivated,not_removed,who
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad i helped you smile buddy we all need it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope you have a glorious day soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,me too
GetMotivated,not_removed,not even joking get angry get mad throw yourself out of bed and force your fucking body to go for a jog make a small step quit your job if you have to financial burdens are a complete fallacy getting debt is better than dying or depression just fuck the money you can always get any other job as long as it helps you to get happier it isnt worth your health apply for school do something for your future anything at all sell everything and go on a trip stay with your parents and see a doctor depression is the largest lie to your own body and you have to fight it off until its gone ive been to rock bottom months ago and know what it feels like to have the monotony of the same shit over and over going nowhere no hope for the future its terrifying but sometimes fight or flight works hand in hand and you have to fly first then fight edit you can downvote the truth you have the power to do that but you will end up dead or in jail if you follow whats comfortable to your own body the main thing is to stop caring and to lose all fucks to give
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me it has been powerful to embrace the suck i grew up being told i felt too much its too much im too intense the emotions are too wild as a result i was conditioned to attempt to numb and suppress to only feel fear my world literally devolved into something veiled by grey for me sometimes i just have to grab onto the feeling that randomly tears through regardless of what it is and see even feeling that as the victory i also want to say i dont think our lives are tragedies we are not here to be pitied your life is precious and you deserve to be here i found it helpful to not allow myself to see my life as some outsiders would its ok if you dont tame the bitch its glorious in my opinion that you go on with life and dont let that bitch get an extra inch from you if you can help it its amazing that you carry on i am so so happy youre still trying to tame the bitch i am so happy you are still here
GetMotivated,not_removed,infinite doots ill buy that for a skeleton 💀
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am sorry i dont have any material handy on this matter ill get back to you if i recall something specific
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree i read studies that depression leads to riskadverse behavior which might be a good correction mechanism in itself
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought wed spoken on a rdepression thread today perhaps im wrong i cant actually find the comment now oops my bad sorry bout that
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i may make a suggestion sharing your story and what helped you is a means of allowing others to connect to you on their terms declaring your experience is the norm forces people to come to you on your terms i applaud you wanting to help a random internet stranger so please dont think im saying your acting incorrectly i just wanted to share a lesson ive learned over the years as a survivor and advocate when someone is struggling with severe mental health issues i believe it is helpful to empower them on their terms not ours when we share stories it can help alleviate the shame and isolation many of us feel hearing someone else say heres what i went through and heres what helped me can illuminate a path for someone to follow when they are ready
GetMotivated,not_removed,its been a year journey for me i left work when i got to the point i couldnt leave the house and my husband had to leave work to care for me for a while but he is going back to work as we were able to get help for him to get a new career that would be enough money to live off until i am better i have joined a group in my local area and starting to make friends again i am hoping to volunteer sometime near christmas and just introduce myself back to the world its hard at times but i am getting there i have had years of therapy and year of counseling so that has helped i have came off half of my medication and that in its self has helped as i was so out of it from them i wasnt able to try to get better in my mind thanks for your message and the advice ☺shit grammer 😕
GetMotivated,not_removed,the main thing is to stop caring and to lose all fucks to give yeah uh i think people like umrsbiggusdickus kind of have that covered if shes depressed at least anxiety well i dont know about that maybe getting angry at that may work anyway mrsbiggusdickus drop me a line whenever you need to chat with a random person with no personal involvement to your real life situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow youre an insightful guy arent you uthecuntdestroyer
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats just the skull fork over the other
GetMotivated,not_removed,no need to apologise i posted a few days ago about depression related stuff but its been kinda dead since so i was confused all good
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for replying and i think youre right thanks for giving that point of view i guess it just feels more to me only because im still in the middle of it youre exactly right though good advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats awesome im glad youre doing better baby steps indeed haha ive had it off and on myself for about the same amount of time im thinking im going to stick with the meds longer this time they seem to be working pretty well again im glad things are getting better
GetMotivated,not_removed,life long bi polar here with ocd etc etc suicide attempts have been a steady pt for thirty years and have tried different combos of meds exercise diet and buddhist meditation for six years socialize at timesgoing on disability has helped and finding projects around the house and yard work is good my family lives thousands of miles awayi do enjoy my time alone to relax with my cats face it i will never be a social butterfly and that is fine with mefor me self acceptance is goodi did work though for three decades
GetMotivated,not_removed,i meant the stuff that causes the anxiety and worries its the anxiety of those things that will paralyse you from doing what needs to be done
GetMotivated,not_removed,sighfine 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
GetMotivated,not_removed,cheers for not biting my head off ill be more careful next time
GetMotivated,not_removed,hi there thanks so much for your note i was concerned my comment might make you upset so im really glad to hear from you im also glad to hear that what i was sharing there resonated its really really really hard to go through the battles we have to fight i believe passionately that everyone has to walk their own path but that its a hell of lot easier to do that when we can do it with the support of others keep doing what you need for you i hope you continue making progress
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks ☺
GetMotivated,not_removed,as long as your happy and doing ok thats great i wish you well my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,i actually found the thread hey i dont do head biting were cool guess im just surprised that i was remembered
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you very much it has been hard to accept but one must find some inner reconciliation
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes real people have real conversations on reddit and even remember them i think its nice remembered i hope you wont hold it against herhim i had a troubling conversation once with a redditor but when i went back days later to check up on him he had deleted his account well fuck that wasnt my intention
GetMotivated,not_removed,then im glad i remembered you its a nice feeling isnt it
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh god no no wasnt holding anything against em at all was pretty flattered tbh i dont think anything i do or say is especially memorable so it caught me off guard is all
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks so much for your support id say the exact same thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,reddit moves in mysterious ways but sometimes its hard to imagine people actually read this many of them just lurking i hope youll be alright by the way
GetMotivated,not_removed,probably the sense of anonymity can pretty much say anything you like and because nobody knows who you areits easier and a lot easier to assume that itll be disregarded ill be cool thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice drone shot
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was going to say that this does not seem realistic at all but its kind of cool you guys are actually helping others complete their bucket list items you dont see that too often
GetMotivated,not_removed,did anyone else hear the soap drop
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was definitely the money shot
GetMotivated,not_removed,one of my favorite shots from this whole project
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks that is what we were going for
GetMotivated,not_removed,ah dude that is so cool to hear we look up to both of them just get out there and do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,havent watched the video yet but i like the way this is sounding
GetMotivated,not_removed,self improvement is a good thing the method is extreme its better to anticipate the problems that lead to the breakup and then address is early maybe the breakup is going to happen anyway maybe it wont if selfimprovement is the answer after the breakup it was probably needed before
GetMotivated,not_removed,does it matter that the source of motivation is external if its all external its easier to stop if your only motivation to improve is to show your ex what a mistake they made by breaking up with you eventually youll realize that its best to forget about them and move on and forget about your improvements if a breakup causes you to take a hard look at yourself and realize you should change for you not for anyone else that can be good if they leave you because your career is going nowhere and you sit there and think oh theyre right it happened so slowly that i never really realized and you go out and work on your job because now you see it and now you want better thats probably sustainable
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure i used to think that unless the change began from some deep understanding of oneself then it wasnt as authentic personally rejectionbreakups dont motivate me to improve myself they motivate me to feel like crap and want to die for people who do get pushed into action by it it seems to at least overcome inertia which is a huge part of getting things done
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me change for the better is normally good my only concern about your new idea is that you clearly have no end goal to reach hence the new fitness routine will fail and you feeling unsure getting fitter and feeling better about yourself always is a great thing so you now have to decide if you want a short term goal or a life change goal short term goals are easier to do so if i was you i would say i want to hit the gym and eat right for the next week without mistakes from there expand your time or move on to whatever else simple short term goals after rejection are very beneficial to improving your selfesteem just think how you would feel after week of completing your goal and focus on that
GetMotivated,not_removed,its good if you want to get better at your workout goals it doesnt necessarily help you with your girl problems learn for yourself if this default reaction works for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me i dont think im directly motivate by the break up yes initial i will stay distracted by working out a ton and im usually too upset to eat but that phase never lasts its more like the break up aka being alone causes me or maybe gives me the timespace to self reflect its during these periods of self reflection that bring about greatlonglasting change for me i am able to identify things i dont like about myself or want to improve on develop an action plan and start working towards my goals
GetMotivated,not_removed,my first breakup kickstarted myself improvement and helped me cope with my emotions by channeling them into a positive thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,i started getting healthy at the end of my recent relationship now that shes out of the picture my goal is to get into great fucking shape and win the break up shes gonna slag around but ive always been a quality over quantity guy so finding someone as hot as herits a bit shallow but i spent and half being not shallow or selfish with her
GetMotivated,not_removed,its unhealthy because its usually a temporary change yoyo dieting and exercising is actually pretty damaging to your body and its temporary because its from an outside source instead of a genuine desire to better yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey i dont remember that conversation that must mean theres a new episode of season thanks for reminding me santurechia
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really like watching mr robot
GetMotivated,not_removed,my dream is to marry a super hot girl
GetMotivated,not_removed,my aunt to my mother a long time ago stop dreaming child my mom to my auntlet me dream as that gives me goals in the end although my aunt earnes a lot more money my parents are a lot happier and life in a large house just outside of the city why because they deared to dream and follow that dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,just because people have done it doesnt mean you should not the goal is just a goal everybodys journey to get there is different we all learn the same things but it affects us all emotionally and thats all that matters
GetMotivated,not_removed,he means day dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,dream isnt correlated just on money if you dream money you dream an ugly existence then you have to fade
GetMotivated,not_removed,practice doesnt make perfect practicing being perfect makes perfect only if you can do it perfectly times can you consider you have mastered it just turning up and trying isnt enough i think the japanese had this down a while before this research
GetMotivated,not_removed,took me about minutes to get over how he wears his headphones but i really liked his quote thats all you get to do in life you get to do stuff and then you die
GetMotivated,not_removed,he says im a lucky bastard right at the end and all im thinking is that he has worked and made himself a lucky bastard it wasnt just a coincidence
GetMotivated,not_removed,one of the greats
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this is empty no help huh
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you doing this on paper
GetMotivated,not_removed,how has it been so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeasir
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly changed my life ive never seen such a fast change in direction in my life i constantly getting smarter more confident etc even small things are improving like my memory and focus thebiggest part is that im way happier now im so relaxed and content with life because of the strides ive been making sorry i dont mean to dump that all out haha but you asked and ive been waiting to tell someone
GetMotivated,not_removed,please keep me updated on your journey i thought about your journal and outlined mine just now do not feel like you are dumping anything on anyone we are all in this together
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats your own question
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing but now
GetMotivated,not_removed,there are only seven days in the week and someday is not one of them rita chand
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really do badly want to have people to support me but when the chips are down people dont give a shit about me and the friends and people who genuinely do give a shit have their own problems and lives and cant give me the support i badly want so ive learned how to get by without being dependent on anyone it sucks i fuck up a lot but i just wipe my tears off my face and get back into it id rather it be this way because being dependent on others has caused me nothing but pain and heartache and ive suffered so very needlessly because of other peoples meddling my mother decided to assist me by opening my bank statements and signing me up behind my back to benefits that were illegal for me to have so i almost lost my apartment because of that after she died i love people but i know people do not want me so i have to get by i expect nothing off anyone even my closest friends and family because i know i have to be completely independent if i want to get anywhere in this world thats me if you can find people you can rely on its a blessing but sometimes there arent people you can rely on and tough shit one reason why i am glad i am forcing myself to stand on my own two feet is because the few people who are there for me i dont want to use them as a crutch i dont want to use them as my on call therapists every time i have an awful day because every day is a bad day usually i am going to save up and get a good therapist i am seeing cbt but that is focusing on my intrusive thoughts and ocd and the problems created by my aspergers and dyspraxia not talking about traumas and sadnesses its very good but i really have to bottle up my feelings and swallow most of my bitternesses which means i have trouble keeping my mask up around others and i dont want to be vulnerable ever again ive seen people who make their loved ones lives a misery because they know how to use their problems to manipulate others my ex best friend the guy who was like my soulmate to the point that everyone thought we were gay lovers got a very damaged narcissistic girlfriend who has succeeded in driving us apart and because he was so pussywhipped and in awe of her mental and physical health problems he never stands up to her no matter how shitty or demanding she is and instead has cut me loose and projects her behaviour onto me when i make a conscious decision to not be like that and i wouldnt be like that even if people did indulge me the way they do her i have great need but i dont want to be needy life is such a struggle and my life has been a neverending struggle because people either wont or cant support me or help me as much as i need but thats too bad at least i can stand on my own two feet unlike the ex friends i know who run wailing to mommy and daddy when things get tough or need to spend several months on some sunkissed paradise to pu tthemseves back together when things get a little bit tough and id rather be independent then that weak so i dont envy their economic stability bursting social calenders nice comfortable jobs cushy jobs loving relationships and loving families and still alive parents because all its done is turn them into a pack of pretentious lazy capricious self indulgent insecure selfpitying trifling motherfuckers they take treasure and treat it like trash while i know how to take trash and turn it into treasure sometimes literally i do love creating pretty things out of scraps and things that would normally get thrown away or get overlooked i often collect interesting bottles and use them as vases or make origami out of abandoned club flyers and expired coupons for example becaues ive spent almost my entire life in isolation and being alienated from pretty much everyone i developed a very rich inner universe to compensate and stop myself going crazy and the few people who do put up with me i get to share it with them i like telling stories to my godchildren and making paintings for their rooms with my watercolours or when my aunt had to take all the decorations off her tree and was worried my uncle would be disappointed i made a bunch of drawings of fish he used to be a fisherman and fish are something im actually good at drawing i made him a painting of a fish for his christmas present and got a nice frame for it in micheals and angels a whole bunch of origami and decorated the tree with that instead because ive been on my own most of my life i have had to be my own therapist cheerleader artist critiquer best friend brother and all that i dont like it but sometimes you just dont have a choice when of the people you meet treat you like garbage
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody owes you their help looking at other peoples help as a gift will make you feel a lot less angry about doing things on your own
GetMotivated,not_removed,i do im very grateful for any help i receive but i prefer doing things on my own anyway i like to take ownership of myself i prefer to help others then to be helped if i am honest
GetMotivated,not_removed,i actually found the game of thrones soundtracks excellent to listen to while studying they are more cinematic orchestra than classical though they are very calming and provide a pleasant unintrustive background for studying they are all available on youtube
GetMotivated,not_removed,rudy soundtrack the launch from the apollo soundtrack mozarts requiem academy of st martin in the fields dances with wolves soundtrack inception soundtrack sometimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,it largely depends upon the kind of classical music you want to use i did a quick google search and popped up its a mix of various compositions not one larger work like beethovens i think of beethovens as being a grand choral composition meaning that its a work which uses a choir and orchestra i dont think thats the actual term for that but i have to go to work and dont have time right now to look up the real term is that the type of classical music you are looking for you might avoid requiems in general because theyre classical music written to memorialize dead people but perhaps not exclusively i noticed minutemands mozart recommendation and i dont mean to disparage it you cant really go wrong with mozart or js bach either for that matter maybe check out beethovens symphony eroica if you havent already i dont know how long it is maybe gustav holst the planets again ive no idea how long it is and i think its only orchestral its cliché but vivaldis four seasons is nice i prefer it by the academy of ancient music because its more authentic to the original time period but the four seasons isnt anywhere near an hour
GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure if youre looking for something like this but if you dont know just give it a try works good for concentration httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjbnhjsdiho
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know what just happened but this is fucking beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,baby till the day i fucking die
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was amazing
GetMotivated,not_removed,same
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are optimistic because you are shifting responsibility to your future self you are procrastinating next time when you make promises and set a goal think about who you see fulfilling those goals you or a better version of yourself in my case i usually saw a different version of myself and tried to be more like him and believe me it changed me to the very core
GetMotivated,not_removed,see this article httpjamesclearcomwillpowerdecisionfatigue
GetMotivated,not_removed,it seems like your main problem is boredom you need to get your mind off food and put your energy and concentration skills into something constructive i think the best way to break an addiction is to start a new one thats actually positive by the way your hand eye coordination skills are actually quite valuable they will come in handy if you ever want to learn how to fly a quadcopter flying a quad is a lot like playing a video game and unmanned vehicle related jobs pay a lot put all that energy into learning how to fly one you can start small then work your way up check out my ultimate guide to quads for more info httprobotfanaticscombestmicroquadcopter really curious what you think i am an english as a second language english teacher in hungary and a lot of my kids are bored and unmotivated im thinking about introducing a quadcopter program at my school
GetMotivated,not_removed,wtf where dis post at
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need to get up at to train tommorrow i hate it but i love it
GetMotivated,not_removed,final paper for qualitative research class
GetMotivated,not_removed,im about to sleep but knowing that tomorrow ive gotta get up early to feed all these farm animals and clean all their shelters is making me wish i wont wake up could really use some motivation for when i wake up
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am undergrad who is anxious to do many things like learning different things but the mere idea of doing those things make me tired and i am not able to those things i watch motivational videos and start nofap challenge and i feel like superhuman during this time but after few days i relapse and i feel disgusted with myself with no will to livei compare myself with others i am lazy but with a lot of potential motivate me to do my best and utilise this hidden potential
GetMotivated,not_removed,i fail at almost everything i do yet all the other people around me in the same path are succeeding i know i shouldnt compare my self but it is hard not to i wonder if i am taking the wrong path in life or i am just mean to struggle in everything
GetMotivated,not_removed,education system is fucked up
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need to not worry about the fact that my girlfriend just cheated on me
GetMotivated,not_removed,when youre staring at that alarm clock wondering if you an get away with hitting that snooze button you just need to say fuck you snooze button youre not keeping me away from what i love one second longer sorry i know that one was a touch half assed but you sound like you already kinda have it sorted
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds boringbut you know what else sounds boring dying of cancer when bannedagainlol could have contributed toward finding a cure but chose to flunk out of college and spend the rest of his life lying on the couch eating cheez its instead youre gonna write that mother fucker and not just because you have to but because the world fucking needs you to you may not know it now the world may not know it now hell i dont even fucking know it now but youre gonna make us know bannedagainlol youre going to make us know by writing the best fucking qualitative research paper thats ever been written a qualitative research paper so good it slaps us in the fucking face with how good it is
GetMotivated,not_removed,you love animals i love animalsyou know what i fucking hate about animals though animals cant say thank you when you feed them no thank you when you clean up their piss and shit no thank you but you know theyre grateful dont you amazingflower but whats more important is that you need to be grateful to yourself ever thought about that ever thought about how many animals would be dead if you didnt feed them living in squalor if you didnt clean up after them how often do you thank yourself for that how often do you write that off like its just a job you dont do it because its just a job you dont do it because you have to if it was something that had to be done then more people would fucking do it no you do it because you are a good fucking person and you need to acknowledge that more often you need to shout that more often im amazingflower and i feed animals because im a good fucking person what are you a good fucking person what was that a good fucking person mother fucking right you are now get out there and be the good fucking person you were born to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,i could brow beat you all day but it looks like youre already doing plenty of that yourself what you have to be proud of is the fact that you see a higher potential in yourself every time you make the right choice do the right thing avoid your temptations you need to start saying im and im fucking killing it and every time you fall off the wagon you need to start saying im and im fucking human the greatest basketball players blow a shot sometimes and they dont lose the will to live why should you every time you blow a load
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant tell you if you should be on a different path or not youre the one who has to decide that ill tell you one thing though theres nothing wrong with struggling and theres nothing wrong with taking longer to get things right than others slow learners are deep learners when they finally get something down theyve got fucking down and theyre stronger for it so keep struggling keep failing thats what makes you one of the lucky ones
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok ill do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,mattorchard you just fucking killed it man with that speech
GetMotivated,not_removed,stephen please dont hurt me
GetMotivated,not_removed,how about its more like a swimming pool youll have to swim the length of the pool but every stroke is a new emotion to swim through nbsp or how about this your thoughts memories and emotions are the ocean the waves crash against the beach and all you have to do is ride the tide of life nbsp youre the author your life is in chapters youve just got to write it nbsp this was fun

GetMotivated,not_removed,not saving enough money for retirement savesavesave
GetMotivated,not_removed,not saving enough for retirement and not traveling enough
GetMotivated,not_removed,it aint the getting there its the going
GetMotivated,not_removed,hot ones
GetMotivated,not_removed,wanna see food
GetMotivated,not_removed,you still havent given up on me never
GetMotivated,not_removed,so i recently got terminated from my first job out of college i had an optimistic outlook at my job even when things were going south i thought that if i just put forth a genuine effort to make my managers happy then they would recognize my efforts at a true and spirited act of a determined employee it didnt pay off and four and a half months from my employment date i was terminated sadly those bound for retirement dont look at succession as a key to the companies success they only want things to stay static boring and safe take for example my vp everyday this man who managed billion dollars in spend for my company whom you would think would spend his lunches going out and meeting with movers and shakers instead spent his lunches in the same place every single day eating the same subway sandwich he had ordered from the same place for the past years this sad sorry little man fired me and he did me a favor i hope that my life isnt as colorless dull or just as sad as his if he didnt fire me my goal would eventually to be more like him
GetMotivated,not_removed,i went to the doctor yesterday im lbs i got a prescription and joined a gym within hours i took the stairs at work i work on the floor almost passed out from it i will be unfat
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you drop out now you can have that sweet sweet gas station jobfor the rest of your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,its tough i know i finished highschool living in my car it sucked and felt ridiculous but being an adult is easy man all you need is to finish highschool and ideally go to college make some money and you can literally do whatever the hell you want just finish highschool
GetMotivated,not_removed,just get a ged and immediatly enroll yourself in community college gain some credts transfer to a better scool high school is bullshit higher ed is not if you cant handle college pursue vocational training after your ged find an internship or an apprenticeship the key is finding something you love to thats also a value to society dont be lazy
GetMotivated,not_removed,look in school i decided to blow it off never got good grades never did anything now i make basically minimum wage and get no sleep and wake up in pain each day working hours in retail trust me stay in school get your education its extremely worth it in the end
GetMotivated,not_removed,your life is still ahead of you if you drop out you wont be able to do things you want to well its unlikely considering youll get a low salary stay in high school if you put your mind to it its not that hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,work at a fast food place work on the busiest day of the week thats the rest of your life without school if youre having issues with your current school change schools most districts are pretty flexible and do care about your success speak to the school counselor and tell he or she how you feel start being in charge is your own life youre worth it now get back out there and get ahead
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you dont provide context how can we help some great people took the ged but they didnt give up because they were anti social or had bad grades they refused to learn from schools that were torturing them and that were bull you have to think about weather you want to leave because youre giving up or because you know you are better off you make the decision dont tell others to force you
GetMotivated,not_removed,what grade are you even in
GetMotivated,not_removed,why do you want to do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,some doors as an adult were far more open for me than if i hadnt finished high school as depressing as it seems you have to have a high school certificate to even flip burgers sure you can start your own business and hopefully milk it but that is in a million associates and potential connections tend to also be more sceptical if it comes up that you hadnt finished high school
GetMotivated,not_removed,do not drop out youve come so far you can do it dude its not worth dropping out
GetMotivated,not_removed,why are you considering dropping out dont expect to find something on the internet that will magically give you the motivation you need
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you drop out of high school be prepared to work a terrible minimum wage job night and day until you realize the huge mistake youve made and decide to go back to adult high school this time not for free youve gotta pull through friend i know it sucks but better to get it over with now instead of postponing it till later and holding back your life a tip that worked for me and might help you set a travel goal for after high school the minute you graduate start working until you have enough saved to go see someplace far off in asia or latin america for example then go see how incredibly lucky we are to get to go to school cliche i know but it works have a great time absorbing yourself in other cultures and when you get back perhaps your mentality on school will have changed best of luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,this depends on your situation why you want to drop out and what your plans are if you do drop out i quit high school two weeks into my senior year i will say this it made life needlessly difficult in many ways i will also say it was the right decision for me i hated high school i was miserable i waited until i turned and withdrew i immediately like two weeks later got my ged and a job this was in and it was easy to just get a crappy job fast at the same time i got a psycho older boyfriend and i blew the crappy job off and spent some time traveling with his crazy ass when i came home i enrolled in community college got another job and also managed to travel with my crazy boyfriend in the summers and winter break etc fast forwarding quite a bit im now i did not continue my education beyond cc but i have carved out little life for myself it hasnt been easy at all and i dont earn as much money as i would like but thats down to me not pushing beyond community college nothing to do with leaving hs early tl dr if you have a direction you want to go in and you just want to get there faster it might be for you otherwise consider toughing it out til the bitter end
GetMotivated,not_removed,in a few years you decide that you want to further yourself and youll end up going back and doing your ged or something youll end up doing this eventually so you may as well stick it out now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i switched schools and it made a world of difference dont be afraid to do it differently
GetMotivated,not_removed,only drop out if you want to be a janitor i did it for years then started taking life seriously man up and finish school dont let your peers effect your future goals understand you probably will not talk to anyone from highschool after you finish for the rest of your life thats just how it is of the time
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck school sell drugs
GetMotivated,not_removed,getting a good job without an education is very very very difficult still possible good jobs and money tend to be synonymous if school isnt for you tough it out or get a ged then head to trade school and learn a skill what is a fact is if you zeros skills you are not a valuable employee therefore will get paid as such either way knowledge is the key
GetMotivated,not_removed,it sounds like youre afraid of failure rather than losing weight it sounds youre afraid of change i struggle with this everyday so many things in life are scary unnerving and different but it doesnt mean you need to be afraid be afraid of living a life unlived be afraid of not giving your all be afraid of not reaching your potential dont ever forget fear use that fear to drive and motivate you to be better start with small victories and build to bigger ones you can succeed if you allow yourself to
GetMotivated,not_removed,why do you say youre afraid of losing weight why afraid instead of just thinking youre too lazy to do it assuming its true that youre afraid a couple of common things would be that youre afraid of failing if you dont try to lose weight you cant fail you could be afraid of losing your identity if youve always seen yourself as the fat guy and youre not longer fat who are you then again it could be that if you lose weight nothing will change like you said if you havent been in a relationship and you say its because youre overweight and then youre not anymore but still arent in a relationship what else is wrong with you maybe its better to be overweight and blame it on that rather than face another possibly harsher reality of course those are just guesses though i dont know anything about you really im just throwing some ideas out to see if any stick you can see if your school offers counseling though many do you may want to go talk to someone who can dig a bit deeper
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey hope im not too late to reply anyways coming from someone who used to be a chubby kid up until my teens and have dealt with eating disorders seems like you are afraid of change or the uncertainty that change brings you see nothing in life is certain there is no confirmation you just have to have a little bit of faith it seems daunting at first yes as you are so used to it also your body is too comfortable harbouring the weight around what you have to do is just start i starting losing weight because of depression i started with walks i walked a day then then and then i started jogging from jogging to a day all that not within days or weeks but over a year and a half it seems like a long time but you have to take one day at a time you have to stop thinking about the people around you or what they might think of you what others think of you is none of your business youre time to get to know yourself your passion interests what you love fitnesshealth may just be one unexplored area that you may grow to love youll never know if you dont try do it for you and thats how its gonna stick you have decided on a change and i am proud that you addressed the issues you are having and tell yourself that something has got to change take one day at a time what you dont want to do is set yourself massive goals in short amount of time which if you do not achieve start beating yourself up about it and then quit no set shortterm goals and take one step at a time it is not only a physical journey but also a mental journey and it is going to be a hell of a ride as they always say only one way to find out you can always pm me if you need advicemotivation etc whether about exercise or just for someone to talk to
GetMotivated,not_removed,we will not return to the countless mistakes of the past i will not relive the failures of the man i once was only through dedication will i destroy all preconception no longer will i let myself be truly satisfied with the standard we will not return to the countless mistakes of the past only through dedication will i destroy all preconception let this be be the day day of my my declaration let this be the day of my declaration join me walk with me shatter the bonds that tie us to what we strive to never be join me walk with me read more killswitch engage declaration lyrics metrolyrics
GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful pictures i especially love the rocket launches i had some friends do the project and i had always toyed with the idea this might have been the motivation i needed thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,its great
GetMotivated,not_removed,i guess courage is foolish then
GetMotivated,not_removed,blind courage is
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would argue that courage is not necessarily the opposite of fear but for the sake of argument one can chose to ignore the warnings brought by wisdom because they believe the goal being fought for is worth throwing caution to the wind so to speak
GetMotivated,not_removed,perfectly put
GetMotivated,not_removed,the capitalist opens a kite shop
GetMotivated,not_removed,and a real person is perfectly capable of doing all three at the same time
GetMotivated,not_removed,no the pessimist expects it gets worse the optimist hopes it gets better the realist just accepts it
GetMotivated,not_removed,we cant direct the wind but we can adjust the sails thomas s monson edit theres a nice monument in prague where ive seen this quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,its kind of a silly distinction you can complain about the wind and do something about it you can expect a positive outcome and be part of bringing that outcome about and you can adjust sails without the assurance of failure or success the act of complaining expecting and adjusting can take place within the same person without it signifying an enduring personality characteristic im not personally motivated by the fact that people have a range of expectations with a given pursuit although i can appreciate that we have the option of acting on our circumstances when it otherwise appears we have no recourse
GetMotivated,not_removed,can i be i would complain then change the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,both optimists and pessimists contribute to society the optimist invents the aeroplane the pessimist the parachute george bernard shaw
GetMotivated,not_removed,that seems incorrect wouldnt it be the pessimist complains about the wind the optimist expects it to change the realist expects wind my reason being realists arent any more or less motivated to do things than pessimists or optimists yes no because basically the pessimist expects the wind to get worse the optimist expects the wind to get better the realist expects wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,surely its the pessimist expects the wind to worsen the optimist expects it to change for the better pessimists dont really only comment on the current state of affairs
GetMotivated,not_removed,the optimist says this is the best world to live in the pessimist fears this is true
GetMotivated,not_removed,the donald insists there is no wind i know very much about wind and let me tell you if there was any wind i would know about it i know more about wind than the meteorologists if you want the truth i know a great deal about the wind there is no wind no wind at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,the megalomaniac is the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,the harbourmaster watches three idiots fuck around on a boat even though he told them not to go out because a storm was coming
GetMotivated,not_removed,my favorite is optimist thinks the glass is half full pessimist thinks the glass is half empty the realist thinks the glass is at capacity
GetMotivated,not_removed,you know a rich man wrote it when a sailing analogy is used
GetMotivated,not_removed,more like the realist goes well i guess that is just how the wind is
GetMotivated,not_removed,the social warrior falls overboard
GetMotivated,not_removed,the dutch build windmills
GetMotivated,not_removed,i guess im a pessimist because im complaining about that font angle
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck this quote i just saw it on facebook the optimist has faith that life will be okay regardless of the wind optimists arent incapable or unwilling to of solve problems
GetMotivated,not_removed,another pessimistoptimistrealist platitude so profound
GetMotivated,not_removed,optimists seem to view realists as pessimists in my experience which is a bit ironic come to think of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the engineer builds a wind turbine so he can store potential energy for his private yacht that way he can host pretty girls in bikinis and travel all over the world at his own pleasure and thus will always benefit regardless from whichever way the wind blows
GetMotivated,not_removed,how i ask you will you adjust the sails when said wind is coming from me bum
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would complain about the wind while adjusting the sails and hoping it will change what does that make me
GetMotivated,not_removed,i always thought this was such a fucking stupid quote its assuming the pessimist and the optimist both dont adjust the sails like as if theyre not real people like some sort of neanderthal with an inferior brain everybody is going to adjust the sails youre on a god damn sail boat and you likely know about sail boats just a tad if youre in charge of the sails so yeah no shit youre going to adjust the sails regardless of your mental demeanor
GetMotivated,not_removed,very similar to king ezekiels walking dead quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,why is the realist carrying sails around everywhere he goes
GetMotivated,not_removed,no says the man in washington the wind belongs to the poor no says the man in the vatican the wind belongs to god no says the man in moscow the wind belongs to everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,the realist adjusts the sails the realist gets rid of the crew to ration the food for survival ftfy
GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful love it

GetMotivated,not_removed,ive seen this quote like this before cincy cac
GetMotivated,not_removed,for someone who wants the full poem its beautiful and of my favorites risk by william arthur ward to laugh is to risk appearing a fool to weep is to risk appearing sentimental to reach out to another is to risk involvement to expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self to place your ideas and dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss to love is to risk not being loved in return to live is to risk dying to hope is to risk despair to try is to risk failure but risks must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing the person who risks nothing does nothing has nothing is nothing he may avoid suffering and sorrow but he cannot learn feel change grow or live chained by his servitude he is a slave who has forfeited all freedom only a person who risks is free the pessimist complains about the wind the optimist expects it to change and the realist adjusts the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just realized im a pessimistic optimistic realist because i normally totally bitch about the wind whilst adjusting sails but hoping for it to change actually while adjusting sails id be thinking the moment i finish adjusting the damn wind will change and ill have to readjust it all back again is that doublepessimism
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist would do all these things
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if i do all
GetMotivated,not_removed,the cow says errrorooow

GetMotivated,not_removed,the millennial tweets omg the wind sux rn
GetMotivated,not_removed,pragmatist is a much better word to use here

GetMotivated,not_removed,i came to this thread to get motivated not depressed at the petty shallowness of my fellow humans life is not a competition and he who dies with the most money toys stuff does not win we are all in this together ask not for whom the bells tolls and all that
GetMotivated,not_removed,the surealist keeps flying the monkey
GetMotivated,not_removed,the isolationist stays inside
GetMotivated,not_removed,six decades distributing kites but he kept must of them about million worth
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist looks on the ground and is depressed the optimist looks up the sky and thinks of all the goals the realist looks towards himself and goes his personal way
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pragmatist builds a fucking windmill
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a nice saying and thought a bit of a tangent but does anyone else find it a bit snarky when someone proclaims themselves to be a realist after offering an opinion the implication is that what they believe to be true is fact even on matters of opinion
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just piss into the wind and see how far it goes
GetMotivated,not_removed,why does the realist get a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,but there are no sails on a bike
GetMotivated,not_removed,the moral of this story is optimists and pessimists know nothing about sailing
GetMotivated,not_removed,pessimism isnt complaining notice how they used optimism in terms of expecting something good to happen well pessimism is just expecting something not good to happen
GetMotivated,not_removed,since when does pessimismcomplaining and not doing anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if i complain about the wind while also adjusting the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist looks down and hits his head the optimist looks up and loses his footing the realist looks forward and adjusts his path accordingly
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist looks both ways before crossing the one way street the optimist looks the way traffic should be flowing before crossing the one way street the realist uses the footbridge to cross the one way street
GetMotivated,not_removed,none of those statements are mutually exclusive you can change the sails while complaining about the wind while hoping the wind will change
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist is prepared for the worst and pleasantly surprised when they are wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,my dad says this a lot theres people who make things happen people who watch things happen and people who wonder what happened
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read this is the optimist expels and then i optimized
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this quote got the famous william award
GetMotivated,not_removed,ducking wind im sure itll end soon in the meantime ill just ill fly a kite
GetMotivated,not_removed,the optimist can adjust the sails and hope it changes and expect for it to never change
GetMotivated,not_removed,the defeatist hopes the winds change but prepares for worse winds
GetMotivated,not_removed,im an actual sailor and if im being honest doing either of the first twos a bad idea
GetMotivated,not_removed,the realist assumes hell be out in a sailboat in mothafuckin high galeforce winds
GetMotivated,not_removed,this should be a civ quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,ezekiel had it wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont pessimism and optimism only describe how someone feels toward something both the pessimist and the optimist can change the sails the words only describe how they feel about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the full poem is motivating
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just hide under a rock and cry in fetal position until i die
GetMotivated,not_removed,the adventurist says oh well havent been that way yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,pragmatist
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is nice but they dont have equal examples for the pessimistoptimist i feel like it should either be that the pessimest expects the wind to stay the same the optimist expects it to change or it should be the pissimist complains about the wind the optimist acts as if its not so bad since pessimism and optimism are by definition counterparts it works better to give them the same treatment
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is nice but they dont have equal examples for the pessimistoptimist i feel like it should either be that the pessimest expects the wind to stay the same the optimist expects it to change or it should be the pissimist complains about the wind the optimist acts as if its not so bad since pessimism and optimism are by definition counterparts it works better to give them the same treatment
GetMotivated,not_removed,boy this wind sure sucks should change soon though i hope he said adjusting the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can still do all those things at once
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think all three are finein moderation moderation sucks
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like a normal person would do all three
GetMotivated,not_removed,the idealist stands on the bow arms stretched out
GetMotivated,not_removed,my life wasnt going down the shitter but it is now type of thinking
GetMotivated,not_removed,im the one complaining about it while expecting it to change from my complaints while adjusting the sails so i guess i would be a pestilist bwahaha
GetMotivated,not_removed,while you were adjusting the sails i was studying the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,what happens if you do all of the above
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist is a dck for complaining about the wind on a sailing trip
GetMotivated,not_removed,elon musk builds a windpowered hovercraft with artificial intelligence
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you complain about the wind while adjusting the sails and expecting it to change what would that make you
GetMotivated,not_removed,this isnt exactly true no matter how you feel about something being pessimistic optimistic or realistic you can always feel obligated to change things pessimists could change but just so they can get rid of what they see as bad while the optimist would be more focused on possibilities of improvement
GetMotivated,not_removed,but i dont have sails on my bike so i still complain about the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,the enlightened gentleman studies the blade
GetMotivated,not_removed,im wondering where the boat came from
GetMotivated,not_removed,and then there are those of us who simply enjoy the feel of the wind on our face and blowing through our hair
GetMotivated,not_removed,the redditor upvotes and moves on
GetMotivated,not_removed,while everyone discusses the wind sail etc etc get on a speed boat and get to your destination
GetMotivated,not_removed,opposite quote the reasonable man adapts himself to the world the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man george bernard shaw
GetMotivated,not_removed,the average joe reads the reddits
GetMotivated,not_removed,and all three wonder why the photographer chose such an angle
GetMotivated,not_removed,realsim doesnt seem mutually exclusive to me for example you can optimistically expect the wind to change while adjusting your sails in the meantime vice versa for the pessimistic person i like to think of myself as an optimistic realist
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats not really how pessimism works compared to optimism here he would expect it to get worse anyway the realist will not get to where he needs to go because the sails were pointing in the wrong direction
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope you like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,where is this
GetMotivated,not_removed,boy i wouldnt say this to the people of gatlinburg
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh fine then if its windy as fuck ill just adjust the sails on that metaphorical boat that i cant even afford to buy in my thoughts
GetMotivated,not_removed,funny how the realist pretends to be on a ship and tells noone
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like this is in somebodys office or on somebodys wall at an investment banking firmbut maybe im just a pessimist
GetMotivated,not_removed,the rapist knocks all three out and takes them to the captains quarters
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if i complain and change the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,gay
GetMotivated,not_removed,its possible to be an optimistic realist
GetMotivated,not_removed,more like the opportunist
GetMotivated,not_removed,the flatulist blames the dog
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the pessist complains as he raises the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if you arent on a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist looks down and bumps his head the optimist looks up and loses his footing the realist looks straight ahead and adjusts his path accordingly king ezekiel the walking dead
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this because i find a lot of pessimists trying to pretend theyre realists these days saying theres no hope just give up is not the same as accepting that the world is considerably less than perfect
GetMotivated,not_removed,im all
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist sees a glass thats half empty the optimist sees a glass thats half full a realist sees a glass thats two times too big
GetMotivated,not_removed,interesting introducing a realist into the mix so the optimist sees the glass of beer half full pessimist sees it half empty and the realist what guzzles it down for a maximum buzz level avoids consuming a potentially addictive substance what what does the realist do
GetMotivated,not_removed,topic wind another the density qualitative arguments wildfire intensity light chemical elements the larger the calculation can drive monsoon circulations the effect of ventilation flying insect populations in varying interpretations of these dispersal mechanisms down into lower elevations other immobile organisms nuclear detonations in research applications im just a bot yes im only a bot and im sitting here on my digital butt well its a long long journey to the top of reddit fame its a long long wait while i become oh so less lame but i know i havent got much of a shot at least i hope and pray that i will but today i am still just a bot i was inspired by httpswwwredditcomuserpoemforyoursprog poemforyoursprog of whom i am so you think you can love me and leave me to die
GetMotivated,not_removed,a portraitist would pick a better angle
GetMotivated,not_removed,it reminds me of a quote i read somewhere hope like an optimist plan like a pessimist and act like a realist
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt this just focusing on the positive i suppose thats realism in a way but id count them as an optimist
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about those who dont know which way the wind blows
GetMotivated,not_removed,well look a mr i have a boat realist over here
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not the type to complain if we dont get it we try it again marty
GetMotivated,not_removed,give this man an a ward
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist doesnt complain about the wind he fucking expected it he was ready for that shit the very second it came round to try bite him in the ass so the distinction between realist pessimist is completely unnecessary they are really both the same thing the optimist doesnt prepare at all in alot of cases they just blindly assume itll work itself out they are constantly dissapointed when their expectations dont meet reality when they are so unprepared to deal with any problems whenever they may rear their ugly head optimism is basically blind faith that things will work out pessimism is realising that generally more often than not they wont then figuring out what you are going to do about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the sadist watches it burn

GetMotivated,not_removed,i like the cut of your jib
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is in order right not that you choose one
GetMotivated,not_removed,the existentialist says i am the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,is progress miserable when the wind is blowing in the opposite direction you need to go
GetMotivated,not_removed,the realist is the only one with a boat thats the true lesson of the story i guess
GetMotivated,not_removed,realist is what pretentious pessimists like to call themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,m o o n spells peanut butter and jelly sandwich
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not on a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,but wouldnt you be going the wrong way
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if youre not on a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a realist all of you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would dothink all three
GetMotivated,not_removed,what do you call a person that does all three
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a stupid quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,most of the time the pessimist is the realist and the optimist is on a delusional level of optimism
GetMotivated,not_removed,the opportunist builds a wind turbine to harness the winds energy
GetMotivated,not_removed,whos flying the kite thats what i want to know
GetMotivated,not_removed,the most successful people in the world adjusts the sails to the wind they want to have and then the wind just happened to change the way they want it
GetMotivated,not_removed,inside every cynic is a disappointed idealist carlin probably
GetMotivated,not_removed,pick two cant be three
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know what ist i am
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like things sometimes i dont like things sometimes things are real alltimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont really know how to sail tho
GetMotivated,not_removed,the feminist blames it on patriarchy
GetMotivated,not_removed,optimism is always a great mindset to have realists often limit themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if they are complaining about no wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,the opportunist robs the ship while the three argue
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist says free kites for everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,the ultra capitalist copyrights the wind and makes everyone pay a license fee to use it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the mime looses his mime hat in a comical fashion
GetMotivated,not_removed,the stoner opens a pot shop
GetMotivated,not_removed,the feminist claims the wind is raping the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,the idiot manchild wont stop singing seagull juice at the top of his lungs
GetMotivated,not_removed,no the capitalist sells empty jars of organic air
GetMotivated,not_removed,the commies come up with a five year plane that flies
GetMotivated,not_removed,the absudist buys a giraffe
GetMotivated,not_removed,the engineer takes down the sails and starts the engine the experienced sailor sails away from the storm the only sane person in the area wonders why there is a boat on the highway pooh sings a song
GetMotivated,not_removed,the venture capitalist invests in a shipyard
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the flatulentist farts
GetMotivated,not_removed,a pirate looks for the rum
GetMotivated,not_removed,and im the one who farted
GetMotivated,not_removed,feminist blames patriarchy
GetMotivated,not_removed,the opportunist installs a wind farm
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah usually these types of quotes just make an optimist and pessimist seem unnecessarily dumb like only the realist is aware they are on a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is literally my problem solving process this sucks maybe it will fix itself it doesnt welp time to get off my ass and address said issue
GetMotivated,not_removed,this should be top comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the realist is probably just a pessimist in denial
GetMotivated,not_removed,the meteorologist says hold onto your hats folks its going to be a windy one back to you wendy
GetMotivated,not_removed,and every single one adjusts the sails while thinking these things i imagine
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this interpretation i feel like all three would adjust the sails only one would be more emotionally stable at the end of the day
GetMotivated,not_removed,the megalomaniac thinks he can change it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the mentalist expects it to blahgleblagluaaarghhbbbb o
GetMotivated,not_removed,frankie macdonald says this is frankie macdonald wind is coming ahhhhhhh
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually realist is a separate function from optimist and pessimist both an optimist or a pessimist can also be a realist its called rational optimism and rational pessimism those who are most successful and happy in life are rational optimists then there those who are irrational pessimists and irrational optimists these are the ones who make constant poor investments or dont think things through like adjusting the sails the main difference is blindly thinking it gets worse vs blindly hoping it gets better we as individuals fall into different categories for different situations of course but if we are truly aware of it we can try hard to push to be rational optimists in as many situations as possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,part of optimism is seeing the good side of whatever situation not just hoping it gets better
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist pulls out the oars
GetMotivated,not_removed,great now i have to install civilization again
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing but had a hard time putting it into words thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed its actually the most healthy to realize that the winds will change and acknowledge that you didnt cause the winds in the first place while still taking action on the sales in positive psychology usually the more likely you believe in a certain outcome the more likely it will happen and an optimistic outlook allows you to be more happy so the benefits of being an optimist are twofold
GetMotivated,not_removed,i consider the pessimist to be someone like you you cant even enjoy something like a simple quote without having to correct it put it down although im sure you identify as a realist lmao
GetMotivated,not_removed,stupid wind im probably going to have to adjust the sails again in minutes there you go thats all
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am an engineer i would complain all the time while building an automatic sail adjuster then afterwards sit on the deck of my yacht in the beautiful sun at the beautiful mediterranean coastline and intently watch my sail adjuster adjusting
GetMotivated,not_removed,the realist invents nothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,such a true quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,the parachute was invented first
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre exactly right also there are pessimistic realists and there are optimistic realists there are unrealistic pessimists and there are unrealistic optimists being a realist isnt a separate type of belief about the outcome than pessimism or optimism
GetMotivated,not_removed,indeed being a pessimist is not the same as being a whiner
GetMotivated,not_removed,the pessimist expects gale force winds
GetMotivated,not_removed,the idealist believes it can be better still
GetMotivated,not_removed,ha killer joke bro
GetMotivated,not_removed,my life sucks better just accept it
GetMotivated,not_removed,society can be changed we know this because society is always changing the optimist in this situation would see the potential in people to create a secure prosperous and free society the pessimist would assume human nature is too dark to make positive change the realist would attempt to influence incremental change based on their values the idiot would read the aphorism and misinterpret it to insult an imagined enemy and feel smug
GetMotivated,not_removed,what does your name meancouldnt think of something useful tho it is binary
GetMotivated,not_removed,the antioutrager sees an opportunity to totallynotgetoutraged they force their pet issue
GetMotivated,not_removed,by percentage of total electricity production denmark but that data only goes up to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwindpowerbycountry
GetMotivated,not_removed,like an engineer could get a girl onto a yacht
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminds me of a favorite david lee roth quote money cant buy you happiness but it can buy you a yacht big enough to pull up right alongside it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the engineer will tell you in full earnest either the yacht is not a suitable foundation for your wind turbine tower or you will have a problem supplying the yacht with the stationary wind mills power cable lenght or battery weightcapacitance then he goes back to trying to wire a wifi module to his toaster so he can initiate the toasting while still in bed
GetMotivated,not_removed,if that is the case the velocity formed by the gasses being jettisoned at approx mach would create a disaster only option is to point you upwards and hope you reach escape velocity before the gasses find a source of ignition
GetMotivated,not_removed,then youll have adjust
GetMotivated,not_removed,the kingdom is favored by your presence once more
GetMotivated,not_removed,and people who are overly optimistic take unnecessary risks a leveled head in most situations is a better trade off being overtly pessimistic is troubling but so is being optimistic to the point of delusions you can and should be a particular mixture of all three in any given situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,you think so they never risk anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,tempered optimistic expectations or controlled pessimistic ideas
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dunno but i guess its a kind of sailor
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow that is beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,confused
GetMotivated,not_removed,crazy
GetMotivated,not_removed,bipolar
GetMotivated,not_removed,most of the time the pessimist is the realist that would make that person a pessimist by default right
GetMotivated,not_removed,being simply optimistic is being a fool you need realistic expectations and temper your outlook that said only being pessimistic is also a hindrance as not much can get done if youre already certain in your head that its going to fail you can be realistically optimistic and pessimisticaly an optimist this statement is setting up a trilemma via its wording probably for effect but you can be varies levels of all three in any given state and all three can be useful given a particular circumstance id still strongly agrue that you need to be able to apply a healthy dose of realism to either of the other states
GetMotivated,not_removed,the mechanics build engines
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the sociologist blames the ship
GetMotivated,not_removed,communists do not make great kites but as everyone has the same no one has the worst
GetMotivated,not_removed,in soviet russia kite shops for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait so opra is really a small time communist
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist says only one type of kite and colour are available all myst buy this kite
GetMotivated,not_removed,not free
GetMotivated,not_removed,the ancap privatises the air
GetMotivated,not_removed,d
GetMotivated,not_removed,well shit now what does the potter do
GetMotivated,not_removed,the mra claims the kite is destroying western civilization
GetMotivated,not_removed,some tourist places actually sell canned air
GetMotivated,not_removed,you must be new to rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing interesting it teaches you about the world nothing a person can actually put into action isnt that exactly what the quote suggests to take action the pessimist and the optimist both respond passively to the problem while the realist takes action i wont argue that its profound or anything but the message is clear
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think its more of an for people who dont know the definition of the three types
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is what drives me crazy both the optimist and pessimists are likely to adjust the sails really one of them just complains while doing it and the only ones i see calling themselves realists are the ones complaining
GetMotivated,not_removed,what does a river in egypt have to do with this
GetMotivated,not_removed,most selfproclaimed realists ive met are actually pessimists in denial
GetMotivated,not_removed,heres how things are looking in your neck of the woods
GetMotivated,not_removed,you could argue the pessimist would be most prepared for new hardships or that the optimist will benefit the most from advantageous conditions
GetMotivated,not_removed,nukes for all mahatma gandhi
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait what does the mormon prophet have to do with civ
GetMotivated,not_removed,my point was that people dont fall squarely into these categories to begin with they certainly dont exclude one another realistically motivation is a complex process that is served by a few wellresearched strategies that dont centrallyinvolve quotes about three arbitrary categories of people im optimistic that if people understand pitfalls of motivational management they will eventually land at something worthwhile but then you said you considered me a pessimist so these distinctions dont get us very far right
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not seeing optimist in that statement adding in an optimist would be more like ugh the wind changed directions sigh ill adjust the sails for now but im hopeful the wind will correct soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,also engineer id make the automatic sail adjuster windpowered because fuck you wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,but who adjusts the adjusting adjuster
GetMotivated,not_removed,true but realists buy aeroplanes and parachutes too so we should keep them around
GetMotivated,not_removed,and then hopes someone else will come along and do the work for him
GetMotivated,not_removed,burnnnnnn
GetMotivated,not_removed,didnt you do the same thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is way over generalising the three attitudes and like most things doesnt acknowledge that pessimism is not nihilism pessimists see the bad in things that doesnt necessarily mean thinking it doesnt matter
GetMotivated,not_removed,blessinem with the truth
GetMotivated,not_removed,converting it to decimal gets you guessing is already taken
GetMotivated,not_removed,sup doog
GetMotivated,not_removed,the point was that the netherlands is stereotypically associated with windmills
GetMotivated,not_removed,of course you can because of the implication
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a yacht it pretty much sells itself
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what they invented hookers for
GetMotivated,not_removed,what thats merely a question of money how much budget to i have to hire female subordinate staff for this project
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you bob for your kind words of wisdom youve saved me from a terrible case of spontaneous human combustion
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats s good analogy a balanced mix would a healthy mix
GetMotivated,not_removed,well all the pessimists i know risk just as much as optimists they just blame the failure on everyone else once it goes wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyjrjpwgzjiy
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the eyes of someone who was an excessive optimist a lot of people treat bitter realism as pessimism whereas the realist would see a pessimist more clearly a pessimist might say life is futile i should just end it while a realist would approach with more stoicism and say life is pointless yes i can wallow as such channel all my energy into living the best i can or just exist as i am that middle ground stoicism id say defines the realist all imho of course i dare say i have a tendency to rope stoicism with a zen realism though
GetMotivated,not_removed,its silly to set unrealistic goals yes but its bad to limit yourself its not a coincidence that many of the worlds most successful people practise self affirmation and the law of attraction
GetMotivated,not_removed,the cow goes moo
GetMotivated,not_removed,the opportunist robs the engines while the three argue
GetMotivated,not_removed,my thought exactly
GetMotivated,not_removed,seize the means of aerodynamics
GetMotivated,not_removed,idealist says the winds are corrupt
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyone gets one brace and of sail
GetMotivated,not_removed,build a kite make the wind pay for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the libertarian says dont tell me what to do with my wind and i wont tell you to do with yours he then goes on an unrelated rant about vaccines clearing the room around him
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist claims those kites are made by people who deserve what they have earnt and that the fruits of said labour will be distributed fairly
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist says those kites that the capitalist foreign child slave labor made should be taken by the government and distributed equally among the entire population ftfy
GetMotivated,not_removed,is it hard to immagine thay communists can make stuff too
GetMotivated,not_removed,communists says theres not enough kites for everyone burn the kites
GetMotivated,not_removed,and that the kite shop owner be put to death as well as his entire family and the kite is not a symbol for food theres no food in communism and the kites are stripped of any useful resources for use by the dictatorship of the proletariat leaving the redistributed kites useless for anything constructive or even amusing but hey john lennon said it was cool so it must be cool
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually they take the kite factory so they can continue producing kites without a private owner
GetMotivated,not_removed,except sally ss arrested that bitch for turning her kite into shoes no one else has shoes how dare she
GetMotivated,not_removed,in soviet russia wind blows you wait
GetMotivated,not_removed,this one i had to respond to if she was she would be giving a lot more of her wealth than she already does rich bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,defeat voldemort
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a spaceballs joke to be made here but im not clever enough
GetMotivated,not_removed,tourist i bought that air to prepare for the apocalypse
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont see why pessimists have to complain some of them do some of them dont being a pessimist just means youre expecting the worst to happen not that you complain about whats happening you can have both though the complaining pessimist
GetMotivated,not_removed,the definition of a realist is one who neither complains nor hopes
GetMotivated,not_removed,found the pessimist
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre really missing the point of the metaphor
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats not what optimism is
GetMotivated,not_removed,a pessimist or an optimist can be a realist they are not mutually exclusives
GetMotivated,not_removed,i get the point of the metaphor i was just making a joke on the self proclaimed realists in the world guy the world is filled with stupid people and were inevitably going to drive the planet to extinction due to nuclear warfare guy wow stop being so negative guy wtf bro im just being a realist if you cant handle the truth then maybe i shouldnt talk to you about this stuff realism has largely just become pessimism for people who wont admit it
GetMotivated,not_removed,in reality a pessimist who happens to be on a sailboat on a nice windy day would be quite happy now if theyre on a sailboat in a hurricane they might be a bit upset along with both the optimist and realist
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think that pessimist which i can often be or optimist are ever blind unless they are totally uneducated but i would say that realist are oftentimes more straight forward and accepting in this instance i would say that adjusting the sails would mean accepting whatever your reality is and making do with what you have to make your situation better expecting your situation to change for the worse or better is childish but knowing that it can change either way is a realist way of thinking which i totally subscribe to
GetMotivated,not_removed,hardcore realistic pessimism is truly the most rewarding outlook on life when shitty things happen you expected that shit when good things happen its a nice surprise but youre always ready for things to turn back to shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,get your coats and jackets folks its going to be a cold one all about the dropping temperatures and more coming up in a bit doodolooodoodooo dunn dunn
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont nuke me harambe
GetMotivated,not_removed,what you know about love what love know about you trinidad james
GetMotivated,not_removed,nukes for some miniature american flags for others bob dole
GetMotivated,not_removed,people do generally fall into these categories youre wrong from the start and over complicating it its often you find people who have a completely negative outlook on life aka pessimist but will call themselves a realist
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think the optimist comes from believing that the wind will change in your favor soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah like the tailssails on farm wind turbines the little tail at the top of the mast is pushed by the wind thereby giving the direction which is mechanically transferred over a gear to power by boost of a coiled spring or some other energy storage i can rewind easily perhaps with a separate wind turbine p the mechanism that holds the sail steady at the certain angle i want to have it in the wind with
GetMotivated,not_removed,the adjustment bureau
GetMotivated,not_removed,and so the opportunist shows up
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeahidiots doing idiot things because theyre idiots
GetMotivated,not_removed,bern
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes but its ok because im an idiot
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a musical phrase is familiar but i cant recall where its from edit french national anthem
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh forgot about the most easy and obvious one i thought of hexa dezimal and as a word but i cant think clearly anymore anyways because this is my zip code oo
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually the cow goes shazoo
GetMotivated,not_removed,what does the fox say
GetMotivated,not_removed,but what does the fox say
GetMotivated,not_removed,those engines should have left their wallets at home
GetMotivated,not_removed,the communist tries to take the engines for the workers
GetMotivated,not_removed,the hedonist drops anchor and gets drunk
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive got nothing to complain about this sucks
GetMotivated,not_removed,build a meme make the internet pay for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,then his gene pool is extinguished by his incorrigible desire not to wear a seat belt and we dont have to worry about him
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have nothing against vaccines i just dont want them to be mandatory if you get somebody sick that is a biological attack violation of the nap and yes you should be punished
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist says that the means to produce kites should be publicly owned he convinces the workers to organize overthrow the parasitic bourgeois class and create a new classless society where the labours of the proletariat equally benefit everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,distributed fairly by force with no regard to who produces more
GetMotivated,not_removed,and then everyone dies of starvation
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist says those kites that the capitalist foreign child slave labor made should be taken by the government classless stateless community and distributed equally among the entire population
GetMotivated,not_removed,communist countries are known for very low levels of innovation sure they invent stuff like but your creative thinking is quite hampered when the gov owns your inventions and you still get the same as your neighbor who drinks vodka the whole day the psychological effect of communism is devastating although it economically makes sense on paper
GetMotivated,not_removed,please someone with the mentality of if youre successful you owe me is not going to be someone i associate with productiveness
GetMotivated,not_removed,free kites for everyone but not before you get to work at the kite farm
GetMotivated,not_removed,bought everyone elses thread and wood invited people to make the kites sold the kites at the market price used his profits to buy land defends the rewards he got for his risks
GetMotivated,not_removed,in russia kite fly you
GetMotivated,not_removed,no fascist secret police in a communist country peoples security she made those shoes with the kites of others because she did not believe everyone should have a kite suggestions of anything else would suggest you dont believe in the idea of kites for everyone you do believe in a kite for everyone dont you there isnt a person on earth that doesnt enjoy flying a kite and they all want the same for their fellow citizens our way is the right way is the only way because other ways are wrong like those pesky fascists who think you can just tell people what to do instead of giving them the strength to do what we all agree we all want
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,defeat stonerpot
GetMotivated,not_removed,the sad truth is that when spaceballs came out this was a joke nowadays its reality nothing from spaceballs should every become reality except maybe the jammer
GetMotivated,not_removed,you might find it useless because of the way youre applying it i guess im a bit of a pessimist and this puts it into perspective that i should start adapting myself instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,useful is pretty harsh at the very least i think we all learned something about sailing
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually i agree with you completely i have actually seen cheerful pessimists people who over prepare because they expect things to get worse but enjoy every moment of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,when labels for people only get used in quotes and not in normal language then you know they arent very useful terms
GetMotivated,not_removed,no one agrees on a definition thats the problem one definition is what you said another is as simple as viewing things as they really are another includes the way a person deals with problems it depends on the person or the website personally i wish the definition was a person who is obsessed with gathering data about the problem instead of the feeling of the problem still culture defines a word not me
GetMotivated,not_removed,its defining realist as the person who actually does something about his problems however there are such things as optimistic realists who see the winds have turned against them and say looks like things are changing id better take the best advantage of this that i can meanwhile there is also the pessimistic realist who says looks like the situation is bad and will probably get even worse id better prepare myself for impact
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly this entire sub is just trash in general and constantly draws shitty paradigms
GetMotivated,not_removed,personally for me my kind of optimism is just not looking at the bad things in life and or dwelling on them because in the grand scheme of things most things do not matter and or effect you in your life and to hold onto negative thoughts or feelings about them is destructive i would think to myself that wind has many many good uses such as a clean source of power spread bugs across the earth spreads seeds across the earth helps some birds just coast so they can save energy instead of flapping their wings i would think that the wind isnt personally ruining my day and i can adjust to whatever it throws at me because life is much much to short to just give in and complain about tiny things and or even big things
GetMotivated,not_removed,harambe simulator protect a small black child while these bald apes try to kill you
GetMotivated,not_removed,baby dont hurt me dont hurt me no more haddaway
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah thats what im suggesting is not the case its a pessimistic look at human cognition and behaviour to suppose that people are wholly one way or another peoples attitudes beliefs sense of control selfefficacy selfesteem and things of that nature are very much domainspecific that means falling into one of those categories depends on the context that means a general category isnt predictive and therefore isnt informative that means youre wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,acceptance is the most important part
GetMotivated,not_removed,it most certainly does not
GetMotivated,not_removed,show me the car fax
GetMotivated,not_removed,the mechanic builds a safe in the engines for storing wallets
GetMotivated,not_removed,or they could have used bitcoin
GetMotivated,not_removed,that engineer is a spy
GetMotivated,not_removed,the apathist lies down
GetMotivated,not_removed,create the affordable kite act and hope the next guy keeps some of its provisions
GetMotivated,not_removed,hahaha the nap is a joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,humans are biologically wired to live in classes try telling bees they cant have classes will they listen to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,with no regard to who produces more as opposed to capitalism which distributes fairly according to the whims of some idle owner
GetMotivated,not_removed,that reminds me of a postsoviet version of this motivator the optimist studies english the pessimist studies chinese the realist studies kalashnikov
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah not like those red bastards launched the first satellite and created a rocket system which is still in use today
GetMotivated,not_removed,people should domake stuff because they enjoy doing so not because youre getting paid moreless than others who do different stuff this is my idea of an ideal existence
GetMotivated,not_removed,its sad how you associate richness with success
GetMotivated,not_removed,hope for the best plan for the worst
GetMotivated,not_removed,its certainly a gradient scale rather than an all or nothing definition but the whole point of the quote is that you can complain about your situation sit idly while hoping things get better or take the setbacks in stride and keep moving its a hangup i see in a lot of people including myself sometimes youre to focused on the problem than the solution sometimes the solution isnt clearly visible but you wont find it by doing nothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,gotta get that comment out quick while the karma is hot s
GetMotivated,not_removed,that means a general category isnt predictive and therefore isnt informative that means youre wrong lol i feel bad for you that your thought process works like this
GetMotivated,not_removed,the rooster goes gickory gee
GetMotivated,not_removed,the absolutionist is working with the mechanics to free them of their enforced burden
GetMotivated,not_removed,the opportunist hacks their bit coin accounts
GetMotivated,not_removed,live in a dynamic wind environment where the type of kite that works now may not be the type of kite that works years from now
GetMotivated,not_removed,how so if you shine a floodlight at your neighbors house thats a violation of the nap if you burn anything and your neighbor can smell it violation of the nap if you burn anything youre violating the nap against all of humanity by poisoning the air humans breathe if you spit on someone or even breathe in their face you are violating the nap if you steal godgiven resources from humanity you will have to pay humanity back for what you stole does the nap even have any faults
GetMotivated,not_removed,source a bulls butt
GetMotivated,not_removed,check out the original affluent society its public domain at this point classes are not biological for humans they are a result of sedentary life
GetMotivated,not_removed,the majority of capitalistic interactions happen freely no one forced me to buy netflix and i objectively dont need it to do my job survive or even enjoy myself but some ceo is banking hard on that money that i gave him willingly and that millions of others gave him and the shareholders willingly why do i have a say in what happens to that money once its reached the ceo
GetMotivated,not_removed,i found you kim you can´t hide
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this version better
GetMotivated,not_removed,and compared to capitalist economies i didnt say they invent nothing im saying they invent significantly less
GetMotivated,not_removed,ahh awesome so the reds arent an example of communism when you talk about how shit everything turned out for them because the means of production werent democratically owned but they are because its convenient for complimenting innovative prowess
GetMotivated,not_removed,getting paid provides motivation to excel he wasnt saying they dont make stuff he was simply saying they arent innovative because theres no motivation to be believe it or not but humans need some sort of motivation otherwise there is no drive
GetMotivated,not_removed,and who is going to work i mean jobs that are shitty but needed
GetMotivated,not_removed,you find me someone who likes sorting trash or cleaning portajohns enough to do it without a big financial incentive and ill join you at the next communist party meeting
GetMotivated,not_removed,what else would you measure success by inflated self worth thinking you did something right name one rich person who isnt successful
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually the one thing i dont like about capitalism godgiven resources should have to be purchased from humanity not just acquisitioned like oil water land etc
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah so why even include realists pessimists or optimists in the qoute at all if that has nothing to do with how the person handles the actual situation at hand i gues saying people who sit idly hope the wind gets better wasnt as clickbaity
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with you generally but not with one particular piece its not really a gradient there are two completely separate scales one is your outlook on the situation which is anywhere from optimist to pessimist the other is your drive to change things for the better anyone can and should become driven to make things better regardless of their outlook on the situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the australian goes didgeree doo
GetMotivated,not_removed,the capitalists offer the engines free stock shares to abandon the absolutionists
GetMotivated,not_removed,in an anarchocapitalist society the nap cant be enforced effectively effectively making it pointless and ancaps are the ones that push it super hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about taxes they include themselves in just about every transaction and are key to a capitalist state
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you think theyre an example of communism there are reasons that their example does not completely refute communism if you dont think theyre an example of communism then whatever they did is irrelevant to that ideology
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is motivation read einsteins why socialism which explains a lot it talks about how society can influence the individual recognition honor etc in elementary school you probably raised your hand to answer because you would get a gold star and everyone would think youre smart pressure peers would pressure you to work harder and excel a lot will be automated one day when manual labor is done by our robot slaves more people will be left over to innovate by the way capitalism doesnt provide an incentive to create a good product but a profitable one personal sense of accomplishment doing a good job makes some people feel good and wouldnt apply to everyone though for the few to whom neither apply the others are sufficient
GetMotivated,not_removed,robots in fully automated luxury gay slace communism robot slaves would do our dirty work
GetMotivated,not_removed,you created a product or offer a service that people want i have two words for you innovative banking
GetMotivated,not_removed,how innocent sweet child i used to be like you
GetMotivated,not_removed,sweet summer child
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can be successful without being rich
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think ive heard stories of rich parents occasionally giving their kids money and advantage in those very rare im sure cases i would find it hard to argue that the recipient of advantage was more successful than someone who for example worked their way up to be a general manager at mcdonalds while caring for a disabled sibling even if the silver spoon kid ends up graduating from a good college and making comfortable money their net worth might be far higher thsn a mcdonalds manager but what did they succeed at they just managed to not screw up horribly
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think his point is that you can be successful without being rich
GetMotivated,not_removed,lottery winners those who inherited money victims who won lawsuits
GetMotivated,not_removed,the cave man goes yabadaba doo
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not an an cap we need some sort of socialism or well just have feudalism
GetMotivated,not_removed,majority lots of interactions happen either at gun point ie everything government related or by necessity water toilet paper other necessities and restriction needs to be placed on price gouging of the latter
GetMotivated,not_removed,then why did you bring them up with regards to communisms lack of innovation if they described themselves as a social democracy that had a goal of communism
GetMotivated,not_removed,so no communist has ever been to space
GetMotivated,not_removed,america isnt true capitalism either
GetMotivated,not_removed,can i be rich without being succesful
GetMotivated,not_removed,it amazes me that people dont believe this
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you really cant
GetMotivated,not_removed,those are all successful actions
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is tax on pricing and paying wages which covers most things
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt i was simply clarifying the perspective confusion you seemed to be suffering
GetMotivated,not_removed,what
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont have any bantz to pm you please stop asking
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats when your parents are rich
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes if someone gives you a small loan of a million dollars gifts dont make you successful
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you absolutely certain you know what the word successful means those olympic athletes that that get gold in sports that are not popular to watch say judo are they not successful because they are not rich i think you need to set out what you actually mean by successful if we are to have a meaningful discussion
GetMotivated,not_removed,being born in a privileged family is success who knew hey guys im not a bum im successfully existing i just need a rich relative to die to prove me right

GetMotivated,not_removed,wow great video
GetMotivated,not_removed,wat
GetMotivated,not_removed,credit to harry bayfield graphic designer london
GetMotivated,not_removed,there has to be a better filter on content if someone posts one bullshit meme with a single mispelling drop the banhammer on them
GetMotivated,not_removed,help you for free nahhhh
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually a psychological thing the name escapes me but to put it simply we want what we cant have and once it becomes available we no longer want it a perfect example would be the newest iphone when the newest iphone comes out people are in a rush to try to afford it but after a few months when the price goes down a majority of the people wont buy it
GetMotivated,not_removed,you may just really enjoy the process of dreaming and planning and researching and preparing or whatever maybe just let yourself enjoy that piece of it make lists research sketch things out literally or mentally dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,when the computer breaks the distractions are removed also it sounds like youre a planner and you currently drop your plans once you buy a thing instead of making that step if you enjoy planning you might as well have specific and reasonably easy plans for the week after you get it to add some stakes you could make a rule if you dont use it you must return it or sell it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the grass is always greener on the other side
GetMotivated,not_removed,you always want what you cant have
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing is wrong with you practice exercises to develop an attitude of gratitude
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea i think youre spot on there i always to better if i have a list of things to do instead of just going off memory i guess i need to just keep making lists beyond the point where ive acquired something thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,you live a sad life my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,ill believe ill knock him out in the first round come out of the contest fresh cash the cheques deez tings happen
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont even know what im afraid of anymore
GetMotivated,not_removed,was going to post the same idea but didnt know how to phrase it in my experience the good stuff only comes when you are being beat down but dont give up being tenacious and having grit are extremely important qualities to have
GetMotivated,not_removed,find something that challenges you i know for a lot of people getting out of bed is a challenge being out in the world or finding motivation for anything is a challenge ive been there just find something thats hard for you and do your damnest to push through then more challenges will open up and make you stronger for facing them you deserve to be of who you can be everyone does
GetMotivated,not_removed,youll be dead soon enough use it or lose it also being in a constantly high energy way of flow is the best feeling ever better than drugs truly living requires integrity of a level unseen in most people
GetMotivated,not_removed,this can be really tough jim rohn talks about being content with what you have while going after all you want its great that youre happy where you are i think you have to be to some extent its fine to not want to be there forever but if you cant be happy until something youll never be happy so why do you want the things you want why is that important to you come up with compelling answers to those questions one reason might be so you can continue to say you have no regrets
GetMotivated,not_removed,im in the same spot and would love some advice im not happy with my weight or my lack of very close friendssupport network but im not dissatisfied enough to put in serious effort and stick to it
GetMotivated,not_removed,best advice i can offer you is to try something that seems not so good for your health reverse psychology on yourself i was super successful and decided to get into methamphetamine a little bit now im a mess but super motivated to fix it best advice i could give
GetMotivated,not_removed,so youre saying long term goals dont motivate you kinda true for everyone improving your health doesnt have very visible results right off the bat its a slow transition so not very encouraging my advice dont wait for motivation it may never come set a short term goal like im going to work out every day for a week— thats short enough then you can take a break just dont take too long start again this time im going to work out days a week for weeks straight keep this semirandomized pattern going until you form a habit nowadays if i take longer than days to start working out again i feel like rubber so i have to get going
GetMotivated,not_removed,you need someone else to work off it worked for me via a personal trainer just anyone who you know wont allow you to get comfortabke but has your best interests at heart
GetMotivated,not_removed,i enjoy skating i played hockey as a kid i got up at am this morning and went skating on the bike path as usual i only had hours of sleep i only had hours of sleep the night before im tired but the path is always an adventure owls bobcats hawks otters egrets its like the discovery channel you need adventure workouts and adventure dating interpret those terms however you like i used to skate miles round trip from my home on the northside of chicago to adler planetarium downtown it was an adventure half of it along the shores of lake michigan one summer i was skating along north avenue beach and an fighter plane buzzed about feet above my head i got the idea for adventure exercise from my doctor who told me the story of how he was in san francisco for a conference and heard his hotel was only ten miles from the golden gate bridge he put on his running shorts no wallet no watch no cell phone and ran he made to the bridge and came back late for dinner covered with sweat while his colleagues passed him in the hall dressed in suits
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like to take a privilege away from myself as a way of grounding myself i suppose also very good to have friends who will make sure you follow through with the no privilege thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,the best way to get around this is to make successcompletion the reward find the reward in the task you have an assignment the reward is not having to work on it anymore or having a weekend free once completing early losing weight the reward is feeling better or getting to that goal if you continue to not meet your goals then maybe you need to change the way you set goals have you tried smart goals with anything though persistence will get you there keep setting goals even if you keep failing and eventually youll find the way that works
GetMotivated,not_removed,also question what is motivating you to set the goal is it because you should or you want to imo taking ownership of your goals makes you more likely to see them through than if someone else is making you do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think this statement is demonstrably untrue
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody exists on purpose nobody belongs anywhere everybodys gonna die
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this is just blatantly not true
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to all the people who kill themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were given this life because of chance if you were lucky you can enjoy it or not as the case may be
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry but its not a real fact
GetMotivated,not_removed,people kill themselves all the time
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i think thats complete bs
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to the kids who die before theyre
GetMotivated,not_removed,no one gave you this life you earned it as a sperm against millions of others that and the astronomical anomaly of a chance you are even here parents meeting having sexconceiving that one time etc if you need to tell yourself you have a plan or purpose and god is planning something for you do what you need to but its your job to make life have meaning its your choice to make it have a purpose the only thing guaranteed in life is your death period so make it worthwhile while youre still here
GetMotivated,not_removed,bullshit
GetMotivated,not_removed,my name is this
GetMotivated,not_removed,except when you think of all the severely mentally challenged or ill people on this planet who didnt have a godamn chance to begin with luck everything in this world is luck and chance
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree we were given this life because our parents had sex
GetMotivated,not_removed,if thats the a case then why am i suicidal or why would anyone be suicidal if they were given that life because they could handle it was there no thought behind this one
GetMotivated,not_removed,complete bullshit
GetMotivated,not_removed,unoizebastard in case you are having a bad day
GetMotivated,not_removed,right in the feels
GetMotivated,not_removed,then why is my mom always saying she can take it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really dont like this one sorry it kind of implies that everything is planned or predetermined in some way when its not
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed this thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,deleted
GetMotivated,not_removed,good lord what the hell crawled up everyones ass today this is rgetmotivated take your bullshit back to rpolitics where it belongs this is actually quite inspiring so thank you op
GetMotivated,not_removed,that line is a load of bullshit
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah my lazy ass isnt making to hard on myself though lmao
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were given life because it was thrust upon your mom
GetMotivated,not_removed,this remains to be seen
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the words of marcus aurelius be like the jutting rock against which waves are constantly crashing and all around it the frothing foam then settles back down say not oh i am so unfortunate that this has happened to me but rather how fortunate i am that even though this has happened to me i continue uninjured neither terrified by the present nor in fear of the future
GetMotivated,not_removed,this hit me hard because you are strong enough to take it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt ask to be born
GetMotivated,not_removed,well ignore the haters boss i totally needed to hear that about now
GetMotivated,not_removed,no its cuz that sperm met the egg this is fucking dumb
GetMotivated,not_removed,this reminds me of the sentient puddle in hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is a true statement
GetMotivated,not_removed,the quote means different things to different people why make comments trying to prove its fallacy while it may be completely untrue in some cases it might be meaningful to someone else who takes strength from it the same goes for all quotes in rgetmotivated they may sound ridiculous or melodramatic but they might be the words that someone needed to hear
GetMotivated,not_removed,so what about people that kill themselves was they strong enough op
GetMotivated,not_removed,allah burdens not a person beyond his scope he gets reward for that good which he has earned and he is punished for that evil which he has earned
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually pretty inspiring kudos op
GetMotivated,not_removed,this only works for people like me who are too gorram stubborn to give up once we start something ill be damned if i wasted years on life just to stop before i have to
GetMotivated,not_removed,it wasnt given to you you were forced to take it nobody chooses to be born
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is the kind of thing people tell themselves when terrible things happen to them to help them keep going that is all it is a sugar coated white lie
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were given life because mom and dad decided to have you
GetMotivated,not_removed,why
GetMotivated,not_removed,my dad is unknown my mum was alchoholic who fucked randoms people horny got me here
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry but nobody could have been as strong as alexandria radiator and even he couldnt
GetMotivated,not_removed,empty words to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,why i hate people that find hallmark type motivational quotes important
GetMotivated,not_removed,no i just happened to be the sperm that made it to the egg
GetMotivated,not_removed,lame
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were actually given this life because your ancestors were strong enough to survive
GetMotivated,not_removed,i see no hard evidence of that babies are given lives everyday and everyday babies die
GetMotivated,not_removed,or you were too weak to handle a better one 😎
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell it to the children born with horrendous debilitating illnesses every minute to only live short painful torturous lives
GetMotivated,not_removed,cute but no thats what natural selection is for and for sake of topic natural selection can be a much bigger motivation than this
GetMotivated,not_removed,yaa always feel lucky that god has given this life so we should always live each day by doing some good deeds
GetMotivated,not_removed,so are a lot of the stuff posted to this thread
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah knowing a few alcoholics and drug addicts
GetMotivated,not_removed,and not at all motivating
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah its right up there with god only gives what he knows you can handle if that was true we wouldnt have a word for suicide
GetMotivated,not_removed,anybody who says it is a test or whatever should realize that we fail way too often its so ridiculous i just got done reading when good things happen to bad people by harold kushner hes a rabbi so it is based in religion just a heads up if anyone is interested in reading i dont expect everyone to share my views
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is also demonstrably true
GetMotivated,not_removed,ya what about the babys born with cancer and die after a year did god just not like them did he need a baby in heaven did he do it to test the parents if god exists fuck him hes a fucking petty jealous conniving dick
GetMotivated,not_removed,now lets go watch some tv
GetMotivated,not_removed,rnihilism
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep this quote just makes me think of all those who have and are starved to death or been horribly tortured its easy to be strong enough when you have a comfortable life in a developed country but most people through out history havent had that apparently its their fault for not being strong
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats your excuse for pessimism
GetMotivated,not_removed,well they were strong enough to kill themselves that takes some balls tbh
GetMotivated,not_removed,until youre too weak to continue living they forgot the last part
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not but if you take it as a challengeinspiration i think we have a word for that oh yeah motivation you might be more willing to work to overcome obstacles
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant theyre dead
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont be so pessimistic just ignore the bad parts of reality
GetMotivated,not_removed,death will probably not even be a guarntee in maybe like years d
GetMotivated,not_removed,you think the people who actually find this quote inspiring think
GetMotivated,not_removed,she took de d and thats why you were given this life thats not an insult btw thats what my mom did too its biology
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah these are like youtube comments
GetMotivated,not_removed,even if youre a vegetable
GetMotivated,not_removed,well that was redundant
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol god
GetMotivated,not_removed,just like those year olds with brain stem cancer
GetMotivated,not_removed,ya feel lucky he didnt kill you after making you suffer horribly as a child like millions of others
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt ask for it and if i try to return it people will say i just want attention and im selfish edit missing words
GetMotivated,not_removed,is sorry
GetMotivated,not_removed,well no dont you see people who commit suicide are strong enough to handle their lives they just defiantly choose not to because they prefer wickedness to righteousness thats why they deserve to burn in hell forever edit to be clear i meant this sarcastically i regard suicidal people with compassion not judgment im mocking religious judgmentalism here not engaging it
GetMotivated,not_removed,a friend watched his year old son die from a jaw tumor that took over his whole face your kids dead your marriage is in tatters youre unable to parent your other kid and oh by the way the last memory you have of your kids face is this distorted painful looking gruesome face handle that because god would not give you more than you could handle
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to kids who have painful and deadly diseases there are things that are going to be too much for a person to handle
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont know why this is downvoted so much years of biological evolution extinction famine war all led to where we are today we as a species have been forged in the fires of evolution to become the smartest species on the planet and have come to dominate because of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel the same way about karma so that kid with cancer deserves it for living a bad previous life that little boy deserved to get raped and killed because of a life he doesnt even remember living like beleive whatever lets you sleep at night i guess
GetMotivated,not_removed,heaven is disproportionately filled with fetuses toddlers and old demented frail people the number of people in their prime of life must be in the small fractions of one percent
GetMotivated,not_removed,depression is a normal response to a fucked up pointless reality nothing wrong with it no one needs to be obsessed with never feeling bad
GetMotivated,not_removed,denial coming this autumn to everywhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,season hype
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mean realism whats your excuse for delusion
GetMotivated,not_removed,the quote suggests that we were intentionally created by some god who was weighing how hard our life would be and how capable we would be at handling all of those problems we would encounter a the gods most people believe in probably arent real b see other comments about all of the people who are born to terminal illness and live brief excruciating lives or people who just commit suicide
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have chronic pain that shit makes you realise that some loads will break you regardless of how you carry it and quotes like this makes it so much worse
GetMotivated,not_removed,no thats wrong no one knows what another persons life is like in those last moments
GetMotivated,not_removed,how is this not motivating it motivates you to watch out and care for the people who are less fortunate than you and try to spread as much love as you can because that is one sure way to get happiness in this many variable world seems pretty motivating to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,lmao gets downvoted
GetMotivated,not_removed,then why not just say it that way instead of hiding it in a bunch of dogmatic bs
GetMotivated,not_removed,if they died that young they were probably going to be awful people and god was just looking out that or he needed another kid in heaven because he was bored again
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is probably true but too bad we may be the last generation to die like mr nobody
GetMotivated,not_removed,you look strong little bobby here have some of the aids
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody belongs anywhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,s u dropped this
GetMotivated,not_removed,i laughed well done i didnt think the s was necessary its mostly because deep in my heart i wish and hope that no one is that stupid so i figure its sarcasm but i know that these people have existed for generations upon generations
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you think having a negative mindset will make things better
GetMotivated,not_removed,then just give up if you are going to pick and choose the reality you want to see then why pick the one you dislike
GetMotivated,not_removed,many of those from their prime of life would be wearing a military uniform
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i dont mean to be such a downer though you have a right to believe what you want and i respect that this quote may be meaningful and or helpful to people who do believe in some god
GetMotivated,not_removed,concepts like inspiration and motivation presuppose that people need more than facts and cold logic to experience a desire to change theres a reason a person who quits smoking says something like i wanted to see my granddaughters wedding day instead of i wanted to have an arbitrarily longer life fwiw i often find that trying to explain why something is inspirational or energizing to someone who refuses to see it that way is kind of a waste of time pretending you dont understand that many people can be inspired when given a different perspective on their experiences makes you a jaded asshat
GetMotivated,not_removed,this comment is suppowed to be sarcastic dont downvote this lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the award for the worst comment ive ever read here on reddit goes to
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep feelsbadman
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyone is going to die come and watch tv
GetMotivated,not_removed,o i c thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,i prefer objective reality that cancer didnt care what my friends mindset was personally i feel a growth mindset is most useful for me in most cases that said a growth mindset doesnt preclude negative feelings about the deity of ones choosing
GetMotivated,not_removed,you dont know me you dont know what ive gone through and you dont know how fucking awful it is for a person who is living in torture to hear that they can choose what kind of reality they are living in i didnt choose to be in constant pain it just happened some things in life breaks people thats just how it is and telling people who are suffering that they suffer voluntarily is just plain cruel
GetMotivated,not_removed,you could just replace evil with hunger and love with food or sleep or any other biological function love is just an evolved process of reinforcing cooperation in a highly social society it is no more inherently good than hate and if you werent programmed to want it would be as meaningless to you as a monkeys beautiful ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was hands down the most beautiful comment ive seen on reddit so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,i take it you dont know anyone whos had an excessively harrowingly difficult life and died from circumstances like severe depression or financial ruin or murder or sickness and death from a lack of adequate health care try to justify gods plan with every person who pressed a gun to the roof of their mouth and blew their brains out you cant and if you can its just going to be some form of narcissism
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,the truth is too harsh for some people i personally find it much easier to believe that god is a man made tool to cope with death over a picky child who plays favorites and has a plan for everyone if thats the case he planned for children to be born with cancer only to suffer and die a year later if god does exist hes a sick fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,objective reality different people experience different realities with or without cancer you can choose what to focus on if you think your mindset is not helping you change it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know you and you dont know me all i am saying is that you can choose to focus on the negative and you can choose to focus on the less negative suffering is inevitable you either give up or keep going
GetMotivated,not_removed,okay you evil bastard
GetMotivated,not_removed,and im saying there are things that make people give up and rightly so im not one of them but i have empathy enough to realise that there are loads that break people and that people cant always choose what to focus on severe suffering is annoying that way act acceptance and commitment therapy is really good for those that can work on it though it did wonders for me for the people who barely exist from pain and suffering the view looks very different though a person cant think their way out of every situation and to suggest that which this image does thats possible is disingenuous and cruel to the people who have no choice but to suffer greatly
GetMotivated,not_removed,just like there are things that make people keep going forward and rightly so we are talking in two completely different languages here you do whatever you want i choose to focus on the things that make people keep going forward all i know is that having a negative mindset will not make things better and thats all i need to know
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree to a degree but im also human enough to know that its very much okay to not always smile its a very valid response to be sad when youre suffering and its hurtful to always tell people who are suffering that they should smile and be grateful it is great to be grateful and positive its very helpful to see the silver lining in many situations absolutely but its also not always possible to do so life is not black and white life has dark moments and it can be incredibly dangerous to always flee from ones negative emotions embrace the full spectrum of emotions and life will be richer for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,alright let me get my hands on this stop complaining start working when work flows again complain about it it helps stop telling you need more time i just need hours more hours per day no you dont einstein didnt have hours muhamed ali didnt have hours mozart didnt galileo didnt gandhi didnt even fucking hitler didnt if you would get those hours you will get nuts because you still dont get your shit done what you need is structure a plan a schedule set priorities i dare you to screw those priorities one step at a time you need to get fitter go ahead start off with a jumping rope take it but dont overtake it you dont really benefit from nearly collapsing and your heart beating out of your coughing mouth because you cant get those miles done yet do that shit you told you would to feels great trust me watch yourself know what you are knowing notice what you notice look at yourself improving all day absolutely slayin that everyday struggle getting your shit done and rising out of it play god and for completitions sake get punched with a smacking knee to the face by life for no fucking reason lose all your shit go half way crazy lose thousands of brain cells and start off at again i dunno but these are the experiences i made with life so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep cold water increases dopamine level thanks that your mood is improved and you are more motivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,its also training yourself to do something that is uncomfortable short term but rewarding after like most tasks we must complete to achieve goals
GetMotivated,not_removed,your comments on the pursuit is spot on
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was very nice though not nice enough to get rid of my depression still nice
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love this
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are the type of friend that i would hate no offence
GetMotivated,not_removed,why
GetMotivated,not_removed,because some people are too used to enablers who only say poor you and never hold them responsible for themselves but my point is moot regardles because you could hear stuff like this all day every day but not wont act or change until you think it for yourself in your own words in your own mind thats the catch of giving advise
GetMotivated,not_removed,i get what youre saying its kinda fruitless in the end unless the person themselves wants to make a change
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is very true still people need a push in the right direction sometimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,absolutely by no means should this be taken as we should shove off and not offer to help or advise its just at a certain point regardless of what you say people are gonna do what theyre gonna do and maybe they do better and maybe they keep doing what theyre doing my partner and i stuggle with this because he needs to save others from themselves and i am sometimes unhealthily apathetic together we make a balenced effort lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,human happiness is tied to expectation it is why those in the modern era and the first world suffer more from anxiety and depression a world of boundless opportunity is a world of unlimited frustration and disappointment
GetMotivated,not_removed,im of the opposite opinion if you dont set goals and put pressure on yourself to achieve those goals youll never amount to much you can be happy with everything but there then is no incentive to grow growth is happiness in my eyes
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed its easy to be disappointed if you get used to having more then you can truly create enjoy your day
GetMotivated,not_removed,im here because its a default
GetMotivated,not_removed,love this thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for your post unfortunately is has been removed as off topic
GetMotivated,not_removed,normally when i see this kind of thing i expect the author to be some donald trump kind of person born rich and all but i googled estee and it seems she really worked for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,cant say im a huge fan of this quote i see the meaning but shouldnt you have something to work towards
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was going to say cant you have dreams and a strong work ethic lots of people work harder when theyre striving for something
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats he whole point to get you to dot the things you wont do thats why they want you to get motivated lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey i love this idea and would love to be one of the not sure if this is just for people looking for workout motivation or just motivation with life in general this time last year i was fit healthily and had a great job year on i am heavier very unfit unemployed anxious depressed feeling like a lost cause at this point when i discovered your post i thought why not go for it sohere i am hopefully i hear from you soon cheers
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey happiness id love the help is there any chance i can talk to you and explain my situation by phone or pm you tomorrow early morning privately heres hoping thank you for considering me
GetMotivated,not_removed,just wanted to let you know that its amazing what youre doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,excellent thanks for the reply
GetMotivated,not_removed,looking for motivation to workout everything i have done in my life i have managed to never quit except working out i worked at a shit job and the summer and refused to quit it was labour intensive so i slimmed down i recently had some tough weeks with heartbreache and stuff so i really just ate like hell until i felt better i really want to slim down and actually look better maybe this will increase my appearence with women since ive been rejected a lot problem is i am always lazy to go to the gym
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not good in speaking english but ill do my best lately ive been having suicidal thoughts not because i have failed to do something but i can no longer see purpose in everthing i felt tired dealing with people ive just got my college degree this year and i am half way through to getting another one lately i started questioning myself why are we doing these going to school getting a job earn money get rich then we just die going to college is not my thing actually sometimes i excell in school but i am not an academic person i believe that a degree will not determine a persons success or failure but i did go to college because thats what my parents wanted what i really want in life is to be a professional gamer video games and now im at my its too late for that im the kind of person who view my friends as family but lately i just realize that its not a mutual view i have this friend my roommate he got into a fight and i fought for him like a family only to find out that they were still talking to each other while he was still talking shit about that guy when hes not around my problem is if hes not real to him then how can i make sure that hes real to me i dont know if i need motivation or i just need someone to talk with some who is outside my system hope you could help looking forward
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is for everyone who wants to do better i mentioned weight loss because it is a common motivational goal and actually pretty easy one compared to what most people are dealing with for example hopelessness is something ill try to avoid because i dont believe i can help because in this format i depend on other person doing the work hopelessness is extremely hard thing to change and often requires professional inperson help as for your situation as long as you have the will to change it should be pretty easy youve lived it already just something external knocked you off the horse and you allowed yourself to stay down whether it was that loss of employment you mention or something else breakup of intimate relationship for example something hurt you and got you to change your routine in a nutshell we just need to get you back to where you were and that shouldnt be too hard anyways ill pm you as soon as i finish figuring out slots for this week im getting pms on top of comments here so im bound to disappoint somebody just hoping people will understand and be willing to work with me next week if there are no slots for this week thanks and talk soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody is comfortable with sharing deep personal thoughts especially when it comes to being motivated its tough thing to admit you are not doing your best thus know that i truly appreciate your comment and time you invested into it your comment is by far the most detailed so far and you seem to already have pretty good plan in place to show my appreciation regardless of what happens with that available slot i will definitely work with you in some capacity this week you mention studies and finances as main goals now one is easy other one is hard and you probably guessed which is which study is easy because in majority of cases its all up to you if you dont have learning disability or some serious disease that impacts your brain all you truly need to excel in studying is embracing that as part of your identity and then discipline to form habit finances earning money is way harder because it involves other people you can be the best in the world you can give your market other people competition everything has potential to destroy your efforts saving in two months is a goal beyond most year old adults i know im not saying its impossible but considering this is your first time be prepared to fail and if you fail do not let that drain energy out of you use it as learning experience so next time you try you can say this is not my first time now practically if you can work next months for hours a day its pretty simple situation you can flip burgers in mcd and earn what you are looking for ie hours days months hours you are looking for so hourly salary will do now if you cant work hours a day you modify the formula and come up with amount of hours you have available to work so you can figure out what is hourly salary you are looking for and go from there obviously i am skipping over tons of things here tax implications withholding pitching to employer but i want to give you starting point so you can build upon it if we do end up working together ill be glad to spend days helping with details daily whatever happens and whatever you do keep going and keep your head up you are young and have whole life ahead of you by thinking about stuff the way you do you are showing character and all you need to succeed in life is to keep doing that youll be surprised when you learn how many adults failed simply because they decided to give up and stopped trying good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey i would love to publicly get as many details as you can give but if you dont feel comfortable with that and want to share privately then pm with details will do if we do start working together we can consider phone call in any case thanks for leaving comment and im looking forward to helping as much as i can
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah weight loss can be a great goal i forgot to mention that ive actually started my fitness journey about months ago wanted to get in better shape so i went from not being able to run for longer than few minutes to doing under minutes in about months its far from competitive result but im satisfied with it if i can get to under minutes thats pretty much where i would stop and switch to other goals weightlifting interestingly enough when im done with typing on reddit in next minutes im off to gym for us working together please give me about a day to sort things out ive got pms i need to sort out and figure who i will be definitely working with this week if we dont get to work together this week ill at least provide you with a plan and we can do daily check ins next week thanks and expect pm from me tomorrow
GetMotivated,not_removed,its also amazing to receive support from others so thanks for taking time to leave positive comment and upvote
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah this is one of those situations where its easy to slip when giving advice on one hand having experience with running and weightlifting i know that getting to the point where you take shirt off and that solely peeks womens interest is about years worth of hard workouts like at least hour of bpm cardio and heavy weight lifting and strict nutrition and well not talk about bad choices like steroids on the other hand being attractive to women is something that drives of guys you see in gym so its potent motivator to harness i would prefer not to use tricks to motivate because any tricks like this one i broke down are short lived on the other hand if you can trick yourself and use it as spark for habit building of going to gym by all means do it but understand that eventually you need to get to the point where you are not going to the gym for anybody else you are going there for yourself like you value long term effects on your health you are aware that otherwise you would spend that hour just sitting around and doing nothing productive youll start feeling itch of not being in gym because thats your habit i dont have any free spots for this week but if you want to work together we can catch up next week dont be a stranger fire me a pm when you have time and well keep talking
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you could benefit from reading with ujulitocg on the base level life in itself is meaningless i often talk about this and try to explain that meaninglessness shouldnt be cause for depression it should be cause for celebration the fact there is no ultimate goal but anything you choose can be your goal i know that perspective is hard to accept religion shows this well i believe we have established belief system before most of other stuff look at primitive societies that still lived in caves exactly because fate is intrinsic part of what humanity is you want to believe there is something greater and whenever you start to doubt that this huge gaping whole of nothingness emerges to swallow you so if you can accept that im not sure there is much we could work on you seem like you have most things under control and some level of disappointment in life is normal people will continue to say one thing and do another dont be too alarmed about that out of people in my life there is maybe of them i believe can follow through on of what they say if you are trying to find people like that be prepared for long search and lots of disappointment friends who follow up on every promise they make are hard to find in any case feel free to follow up with pm and we can see where we can go from there for this week im definitely booked but we could definitely look into working on something concrete next week if you are up for it talk soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,i definitely will is there a day that is best for u
GetMotivated,not_removed,im definitely free anytime its good to know i have someone to talk to from now on someone outside my group of friends i still have these things in mind though we cannot actually work towards any goal we want we still have to conform with norms and social beliefs as mentioned earlier my dream was to become a professional gamer but i cannot do that because i have to attend school because everyone thinks that thats what i should be doing instead of playing some video games i am not a religious person i believe that there there is one god but i do not believe we should have different religions but if religion could help me with my case i can work on that i am baptized as roman catholic though ps im sorry i have to reply here im still trying to figure out how to send a pm im new in reddit after deactivating my acct in facebook and twitter after being disappointed to people there you dont have to reply fast though we can talk some other time i can understand youre busy and im looking forward to helping you in these project its good to see that some people do actually care goodluck buddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey giraffec i love your detailed responses you are proceeding exactly the right way using this conversation to think through issues that bother you and then come to conclusions for your own benefit we need to keep doing this so you can better define your steps and also see what is realistic and what is not where you can do something and where you are tricking yourself since we are closing up thread for the week next one coming on sunday ill stop with detailed responses here and fire you pm with details
GetMotivated,not_removed,any day is good for me i plan to be here on reddit daily around pm which is when i will respond to pms try to formulate concrete plan i can hold you accountable for and we can then go from there with our conversation talk soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should post this to rgetdisciplined theyre way more about actual content not just quotes or images than rgetmotivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,i spent so many years trying to fix the past living with regret and anxious about everything it wasnt till i let all that shit go and started living right that ive finally found true happiness im thankful for every fucked up thing ive ever been through because its made this happiness so much sweeter all your rules are true
GetMotivated,not_removed,the older i get one thing that keeps popping up is the one foot in front of the other idea i know it seems pretty defeating sometimes but its really how life is in my experience life becomes a constant fight against the current sometimes it wont last forever and it comes and goes but there are many days when youll wake up and wonder how you will be able to just keep swimming not every day is remarkable not every day is a step toward an endgoal or endgame sometimes it comes down to moving forward when its just another foot in front of the other
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks so much man this article really spoke to me mainly because i just gorged on a tub of ice cream but i will begin again and gorge again fuck ice cream is delicious it should be banned honestly
GetMotivated,not_removed,its oclock in the morning and i have been up all night dwelling on things i have no power to control and are making me miserable past hurts that cannot be undone and a toxic fear for future ones i came on here to try and remove myself from negative thoughts that lead to regret and desperation i really cant tell you how much reading your post put my hurt and fear into perspective and gave me a sense of peace to let what cannot be changed or controlled rest and concentrate on the present of my life there is so much more joy to be had if you open your eyes and look around you instead of only seeing what was or what might be ahead thank you for your words they helped me
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is all really true i am trying to motivate myself to work out more and i really see what you mean by the hours thing if i think of all the workouts i have to do it is scary but if i think of the one i am doing right now i am just fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,love it all but especially point my husband would go visit his family who all have high paying jobs no pets retired by etc then he would come back to our place i am a stay at home mum as we decided the sacrifice in income was worth it to put extra time into raising our kids we not only have pets but we rehab wildlife so we have the occasional echidna or possum in the bathroom duck shit on the pathway or an orphaned something hanging in a bag on the kitchen door this keeps us poor just as much as the kids and pets we only house we can afford is old life is messy but full of relationship my husband feels like a bit of a failure because he is not as successful as the rest of his family i try and gently remind him that his kids love him and want to spend time with him his wife loves him and actually likes his company he loves the pets and helping furryfeathered things get back into the wild its easy to lose track of who you are when your around a group of other people that place no value on what you value
GetMotivated,not_removed,first time to use the save button
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is actually pretty biblical matthew therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself todays trouble is enough for today
GetMotivated,not_removed,the last point on quitting and stopping is really quite important as a small example i lost some weight a year or so ago instead of trying to force myself to stick to a strict diet and exercise regime i made moderate commitments i knew i could keep and if i didnt go running for a day or had some cake from a colleagues birthday i didnt worry about it because what mattered was not giving up altogether i didnt quit just stopped for a while
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like these if i could add something everything comes in waves you can be happy for a while but one day that happiness will not be there like it used to its yourself telling you that you are ready to grow ready for more or something different allowing yourself to feel sad happy angry is natural allow yourself the time to understand why you might be feeling like this and if you need to make a positive change or remove a negative stain reflect and contemplate and figure out what you need to do next in your life that will give you the satisfaction you so desire
GetMotivated,not_removed,this post just hit me hard thank you for this
GetMotivated,not_removed,number really spoke to me ive been staying up way too late doing jack shit and only getting about hours of sleep each night at the time what im doing is mildly entertaining watching videos gaming etc but the next day i feel terrible i always tell myself okay tonight im gonna get a full hours and i never do but your post gave me a different perspective on it so thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,good shit thanks my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,saved post
GetMotivated,not_removed,best one yet on this sub no cheesy one liners
GetMotivated,not_removed,while the intellectual advice youre giving is solid i dislike the approach of yeah i just started thinking that way and my life got better even implementing those ideas can be a though journey for one im working on myself for years now and hell do i know these truths i have them internalized on an intellectual level but is my emotional self lacking the maturity to really use them of the time hell yes so i dislike it when people tell me yeah just think different im thinking different the whole time theres not an idea i wouldnt approach but really for many its harder to change for the better than just think a bit different sure if your only problems are a few bad habits and generally slacking off this might set you straight but for deeper problems this just scratches the surface and before the typical shitstorm of this sub begins how im a grinch and how i should others enjoy their motivation they get from this which i do i just want to start a discussion and point out that its not always that easy i just want to add depth and perspective
GetMotivated,not_removed,hits home dont deny yourself something that you want because of whatever reason thats making you afraid go out and try i fought for my so for my right to be independent for a job that i deserved for a life i thought was worth living go out and do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is good
GetMotivated,not_removed,happiness is the byproduct of do the right thing i like this
GetMotivated,not_removed,my erection just tore through my cargo shorts
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like you put to words what i was trying to follow the past year when i turned my life around and put myself together finally being truly happy for myself thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like the idea of stopping quitting i once had an experience where i felt like stopping from something i was doing at the time because i was needing a break but it was an issue because everyone around me questioned my decision as they thought i wanted to quit i believe everyone need a stop whether for temporarily or permanently they will need it
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for this your third point really nailed it for me i always dream about success in the future and all these other great accomplishments that i could do yet i havent started anything towards it i really just need to focus on doing what i can right now and your post helps to remind me of that so thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry i only half agree with the first statement worrying about tomorrow lets you enjoy today i have to be constantly on my toes about everything that im doing in the next month or else ill miss something while im worrying about today and fuck something up you have to pave your today to live it how you want to
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow im impressed i just kept expecting something to be a little bit off point or cheesy but its fucking perfect well done and thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you live in the past you will get depressed this part really struck me ive been dealing internally with something that a couple of people did to me a few years ago guys i thought were my friends my head has been telling me fuck them since then but my heart still hurts to think about it and my heart seems to want to think about it whenever theres any kind of lull i need to move past that moment it was shitty but should not define who i am or even who they were lets carpe the fuck out of this diem
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks op going to put down the phone and take care of my starting with exercising which i stopped too long ago
GetMotivated,not_removed,instead think of success as sustained effort of will i love that that is brilliant i think that might be a big reason why people who get in shape just feel amazing overall not only physically they have also trained their power of will to be much stronger than it used to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,needed this today thankyou
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks so much for this im going through life feeling lost but i know what the general idea of what i want to do im just not convinced of it or scared that i cant live up to it this post kind of put me on a guideline to get back on track
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks it helped although while this bit is true the rewards are not up to you it can get a little hard to keep going self doubt hello when this refuses to turn up even a little but yes the answer is to keep going
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow well said
GetMotivated,not_removed,good motivation
GetMotivated,not_removed,your comment on happiness reminds me of whats been called type fun this is more or less the idea of taking part in something thats difficult unfamiliar or even unpleasant while youre doing the thing but is ultimately so satisfying when you hit your goal or reach an apex that the entire experience becomes more than worth it in retrospect its the sort of pleasure derived from higher intellect either nostalgia and selective memory or extrapolating the impact youre actions made
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you saving this have an upvote edit just realized my upvote put this from to
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is so introspective and uplifting and i love it saving this post for sure
GetMotivated,not_removed,solid advice awesome read thank you for the motivating words
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed to hear read all of this today thank you for the refreshing perspective
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love it it all resonates with me but at the moment i really needed to hear point i am traveling for a long period right now but the end is beginning to approach i am looking forward to go home again but sometimes im so busy with being home that i forget to enjoy my stay all the way on the other side of the world i need to make the most of my current hours thats it home will be important when im further thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yes i like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,things like sucess and talent are overrated and a dime a dozen you want to be an artist stand in line with the million other wannabes you want to be a singer take a number and read the youre not special writing in the wall every tom dick and sally dream about being the one the problem is that the one is a dime a dozen you can do everything right work hard smart stay present be liked and still end up no where perhaps the goal then is to not care about any of it and be content flipping burgers and not being noticed like billions do everyday theres only so many opportunities in a very large pool of people way more talented than you you can always dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,you got it mate if you take this advice to heart it will make you happy every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is some great perspective really needed it
GetMotivated,not_removed,this post is hell damn beautiful its inspiring its helpful and its emotional for me thanks for sharing these fantastic thoughts
GetMotivated,not_removed,never thought about anxiety as living in the future and depression as living in the past but it makes so much sense when you put it like that
GetMotivated,not_removed,so true thank you my friend i needed this
GetMotivated,not_removed,i couldnt have seen this at a better time thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,my entrepreneur friends whole livelihood is spent worrying about the future thats what owning a business is sometimes yes no so i want to link him this but i know hell read over it and keep doing what he does
GetMotivated,not_removed,number is the most difficult to remember everyday
GetMotivated,not_removed,just couldnt agree more the real badass truth of life live on
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is good i like it there is one more thing id like to add that changed my life if you cant you must we often let go of opportunities because we are afraid insecure shy or anything like it we think we cant do it or that we will make a fool of ourselves are not up to the task etc but if you make it a rule that if you hesitate to do something because you think you cant do it then do it so far i have always surprised myself that i actually can do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the way i often think of things is focus on the process not the result our own ego gets in the way of the things we tell ourselves wed like to do ill also say to myself what actions do i take today in order for it to be a success and that helps me get the things done that i dont always intuitively feel like doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,i live in the past and the future man am i fucked
GetMotivated,not_removed,very good posts im often guilty of the artist thing its nice to imagine the end result if i want to write a book or make a graphic novel its nice to imagine seeing it on a shelf or someone reading it its a little harder to just visualize myself sitting and writing or drawing i need to find the joy in that doing instead of just the joy of the result its not easy in this line of work because the entire idea is about making the vision in my head a reality and the middle part is not necessarily supposed to be fun but theres gotta be a way to make that making more fun or enjoyable
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey ujockobutters this is now the top post on reddit it will be recorded at rtopofreddit with all the other top posts

GetMotivated,not_removed,this is some truth love it thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,really great positive advice thanks op
GetMotivated,not_removed,saved
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is very inspirational
GetMotivated,not_removed,well said i appreciate your values of everything listed here but especially idea number three there are people who judge others based on their idea of success too often i agree with your statement and that success should be based on what makes a person feel accomplished not what they think would make others accept them as long as a person does something that makes them happy and does not negatively affect others and isnt immoral then why not do that thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,strongly agree with and for my observations happiness is a byproduct of fulfilling our expectations that means that we are in a condition that we expected as positive therefore we are happier than before three also we are not born to satisfy the condition for success defined by the others but ours no one wants to live a life according to the idea of the others otherwise there is no life
GetMotivated,not_removed,step applies to all of us lurkers on reddit

GetMotivated,not_removed,helped someone buddy you just helped somemany i especially needed to see this after a horrible night last night and watching the hunger games mockingjay part ii it wasnt a bad movie but it was stressful and sad and the only thing that makes all the shit she went through ok is love in the end well what if ya dont have love huh then are ya just an asshole that should bare the full weight of all your shit thats not cool man not cool at all come on you fatcat hollywood producers change it up i probably wouldnt be so critical of it if i was in a better mood but like i said im not anyways to make a long and probably pointless rambling short i am thankful for this advice and i will use it thank you

GetMotivated,not_removed,these tips really struck a chord with me esp the second one i find myself too often feeling down and hoping the sadness will eventually just go away and be replaced by happiness as i mope all day i will definitely keep this in mind the next time im having another spell of depression
GetMotivated,not_removed,about what if you invested much efforts in doing the right thing and the warmth of fulfillment is far too short compared to the efforts invested for example suffering for months to achieve something and feeling this warmth for barely one day same player try again
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you realise you always live about milliseconds in the past depending on your length because of the time it takes the brain to get all the signals and according to this youre depressed if you live in the past doesnt that mean were all deppressed i mean we cant litrally live in the present

GetMotivated,not_removed,got laid off this week and have been terrified of finances and health insurance and getting back on my feet this helped a lot
GetMotivated,not_removed,instead think of success as sustained effort of will this is the only exercise program ive ever been able to commit to if i try to work up to a hundred pushups or even twenty ill psyche myself out if instead i just say do every weekday and whatever you get you get and itll be better than the nothing youd otherwise be doing i get a lot out of it and dont over think it plus im still in control of leveling up if i want like making it harder by adding more weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful

GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for this i resonated with it and enjoyed reading the comments that followed from it
GetMotivated,not_removed,good stuff
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes success shown in mainstream media is fucking with our brain from the young age that is why i have came up with my own success definition being what you want and where you want
GetMotivated,not_removed,very needed much thanks i think im going to print this out and read it everyday
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need to fucking begin again thanks op

GetMotivated,not_removed,love this really resonates with me at this particular point in my life thank you for posting
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for this it was one of the most reassuring things i have ever read on reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is more inspiring than half the selfhelp books ive read
GetMotivated,not_removed,op delivers
GetMotivated,not_removed,i find wisdom to be shocking in its simplicity thank you for this post
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing heres my two cents on it yes we time travel back and forth between time reference points however i think being in the past is a bad thing when the memory is of a depressing situation you can always do some self change work to scrub the memory and take what positives you can from it once youve done that you now elicit a neutral or even positive response in yourself when you bring the memory to mind think about this for a moment where do the past present and future begin and end whether recall a past experience or visualize a future circumstance you still do it from the present dont you success is totally relative to the individual i believe that the true fruits of success are not the material possesions you gain as a result but the character development happiness again is relative to each of us i personal believe that happiness can be turned on inside our nervous systems at will provided a person has experience it before even if they thinkthey havent we can create states approximate to it then again we change as life changes so i may not have these beliefs in a few years best amir campbell
GetMotivated,not_removed,not living in the moment is probably the thing that keeps people from being happy they keep putting off being happy now because theyre assuming it will just happen later they get caught up in the unavoidable failures of the past or the potential problems of the future when right now at that second things are probably pretty good thats not to say you shouldnt plan for the future because of course you should to avoid something bad happening but dont forget right now youll miss a lot of great things going on
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is so good i cant believe its free thank you youve helped me
GetMotivated,not_removed,god damn you wrote this at the perfect time for me years old and this hits so damn close im saving this thank you thank you thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you this was much needed sustainence to a soul adrift
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have some great points the first definitely resonates with me i know i need to live in the present but i feel haunted by my past ive lost some loved ones that i cared deeply about and ive done many things that i regret and i dont how to get over these things
GetMotivated,not_removed,the human being is meant to bear the burden of hours no more no less forget everything else keep hold of this alone each of us lives only now this brief instant the rest has been lived already or is impossible to see marcus aurelius happiness is not something you can pursue but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing just that you do the right thing the rest doesnt matter cold or warm tired or wellrested despised or honored dyingor busy with other assignments because dying too is one of our assignments in life there as well to do what needs doing look inward dont let the true nature of anything elude you before long all existing things will be transformed to rise like smoke assuming all things become one or be dispersed in fragmentsto move from one unselfish act to another with god in mind only there delight and stillness marcus aurelius the worlds idea of success is total shit the object of life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane or is it your reputation thats bothering you but look at how soon were all forgotten the abyss of endless time that swallows it all the emptiness of those applauding hands the people who praise us how capricious they are how arbitrary and the tiny region it takes place the whole earth a point in space and most of it uninhabited marcus aurelius
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for this i feel like ive been lost this year i used to scoff at a quaterlife crisis until smacked me in the face you did an great thing for many people by posting this thank you from the bottom of my heart i am looking forward to tomorrow

GetMotivated,not_removed,saved this is cool
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really like the part of hrs is all you have to play with
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol is this for real could you get a few more stereotypical and bullshit points you could put it on buzzfeed live in the moment happiness is a process find success in yourself fuck me mate thats some deep groundbreaking shieet and sheeple are eating it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont agree with any of those to be honest
GetMotivated,not_removed,so youre saying that the cause of depression is living in the past because it doesnt work this way

GetMotivated,not_removed,this is good stuff man thanks for writing this down king of reminds me of the four agreements
GetMotivated,not_removed,happiness is within the journey not the final destination enjoy every moment while it last dont yearn for the future and lose focus of the present
GetMotivated,not_removed,i want millions of dollars
GetMotivated,not_removed,you and my credit card company agree on rule one
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice la
GetMotivated,not_removed,that first point definitely i found this out after i spent a month living in the wilderness at linville gorge nc theres no time for worrying about what you did in the past and the only thing that youre thinking about in the future in plans for survival i always thought the phrase find yourself was cheesy until i found out that i hardly even knew myself with all of my possessions stripped away its a life changing experience
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminds me of a quote from one tree hill of all places sometimes happiness doesnt come from money or fame or power sometimes happiness comes from good friends good family and the quiet nobility of leading a good life
GetMotivated,not_removed,id like to add this simple adage this too shall pass kinda helps put things in perspective at least for me
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me i came to these important themes unsolicited advice ≠ helping giving ≠ generosity actions identity a bit reductive in list format apologies
GetMotivated,not_removed,haters beware
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you op
GetMotivated,not_removed,love it great advice source advanced age
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,been working on a lot of life lately this sums up a lot of good thoughts thanks for writing and posting i hope you are doing well
GetMotivated,not_removed,good list and i feel the same mostly the success thing is big on my life right now financially im great but why cause i own a home and got money to spend if this what life is about if rather be poor and spend double the time with my family and friends like when i was growing up i tell my kids my idea of success to them is for them to find a passion and pursue it to find their happiness if thats money so be it
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds like you have been reading allen watts
GetMotivated,not_removed,read some allan wats if ur into this shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice i feel it gonna go read some spinoza
GetMotivated,not_removed,i want to cry but im on a train with strangers feet from my face facing my face dont wanna scare anyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for this
GetMotivated,not_removed,its nice being able to come on here and find something that changes your perspective if hours is all i have for today then i should spend it wisely its easier than thinking i have the rest of my life
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cannot agree with it goes without saying that the burdens of the past are not yours but the burdens of the future arent yours either oh yes they are not yours alone but they certainly are dont let them go cooperate with others to resolve them resolving the burdens of the future for future generations to inherit a world better than the one you did actually constitutes a major aspect of your point your purpose of why you exist pretty much agree with the rest
GetMotivated,not_removed,printed it out thanks good post
GetMotivated,not_removed,interesting when i think my dream position i imagine myself working i never think about material wealth i dream about reaching a certain skill level and being able to use it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think this is a great post with awesome points thank you for posting this
GetMotivated,not_removed,mostly good but everything within reason number flaw is that people often dont plan beyond the day you get people yolo spending their paycheck on or soon after payday not setting any aside for later one night out boozing having fun with friends suddenly theyre broke again the next days are torture until payday and then their car gets totalled without insurance buddy if you had less shots each week for the past weeks youd probably have insurance and money to get you through the week removing some of the burden of your uncertain future
GetMotivated,not_removed,the human being is meant to bear the burden of hours no more no less carpe diem drink today for tomorrow we die the others are great points but the first one seems like a useless cliche planning for the future is definately useful and so is looking to the past future makes you anxious well perhaps that anxiousness will put you on a different path or remembering the past will keep you from repeating those mistakes living in the present what does that even mean in practice
GetMotivated,not_removed,im all for not living in the past and wallowing in regret or whatever else but surely its important to see beyond the span of a single day thats the life of a drone our ability to think about the future forwardplanning building homes and equipment and maintaining them for future use is one of the main reasons our species is dominant on our planet there should be a distinction between constantly worrying about some point in the future and planning towards it
GetMotivated,not_removed,tits
GetMotivated,not_removed,saved it thanks good way of thinking and put together eloquently

GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for this everyone in the comments too i seem to be very dependent on weed at the moment you guys gave me a bit of motivation
GetMotivated,not_removed,tai lopez is that you
GetMotivated,not_removed,good stuff thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for sharing this this is beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,great thoughts thanks for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,happiness is being content within your self being content within your self is not a product of action doing the right thing if anything it could be considered as being the right thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldr just do it every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,dick in vagina
GetMotivated,not_removed,to go off your first point when fictional characters in fantasy novels are trying to become an immortal creature that doesnt need sleep im always terrified because i definitely need sleep not in a restful way but in a okay this is the close of this time frame and i will try again tomorrow
GetMotivated,not_removed,great post
GetMotivated,not_removed,success on someone elses terms dont mean a fuckin thing jon langford
GetMotivated,not_removed,how old are you and what is your profession
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know about that one i know people attractive girl who get all the sex they want and when sandra fluke gets up there and proclaims that unprotected sex is a fundamental right everyone nods and applauds then if i response yes i agree that is a right what are we going to do to ensure access to this right to everyone including people without partners i am seen as a monster
GetMotivated,not_removed,insightful and well said can i ask how old you are to have made these realizations and articulated them so well
GetMotivated,not_removed,yolo
GetMotivated,not_removed,your theory has alot of holes in it first you say not to worry about the future or the past then you tell people to do things which revolve around getting a desired future ill tell you what happiness is my grandfather died at and he spent his whole life smoking cigarettes eating ice creams eating meaty food etc he was a farmer and never had a disease in his life all he did was farm few hours a day and he had no stress the moment he was done for the dayhe owned enough land and cattle that even if he did not farm he would never be left hungry so yes he lived and died a happy man sadness was foreign to him he was not sent to a nursing him he did not pay taxes up the ass and he was no slave to his former debts this whole go to gym do repetitive movement that everyone else is doing so people who still wont like you may like you does not work in the long term people try it till they are and then they give up happiness is about being free from external requirements and satisfying internal desires unfortunately much of that depends on luck and placement
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt that basically some of the points dale carnegie made in his book
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do you improve if you live in frame and never look into future to what you want to become
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed to read this thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,also quitting while youre ahead is not the same as quitting
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice
GetMotivated,not_removed,number bites deep
GetMotivated,not_removed,great read op
GetMotivated,not_removed,these three values always resonate with me and i feel like they are some of the most challenging to fully embrace its easy to not cheat to be kind to value family etc but to truly forgive yourself to let the past be the past to not over value material possessions and a false sense of success those are the true challenges in life find what makes you happy deep in your heart both with the people in your life and with what you do as a hobby or for work i feel like you can do something you dont necessarily love if you supplement it with other activities in your life and i feel like the above start to fall into place these three values are all a major part of the book tuesdays with morrie if you havent read it i highly suggest it such an excellent read
GetMotivated,not_removed,feels like im stuck on finding love all i do is think about old relationships and think about the future without one i think it is very much effecting my day to day happiness i am going to focus on letting the past stay in the past and not thinking about the future just make every day as productive ad full as i can the hope is a side effect can be the relationship thing will take care of itself maybe the focus on it is just sabotaging me thank you for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,brilliant
GetMotivated,not_removed,being one who has sat at the deathbed of several family members the one spoken regret is the lack of investment in relationships makes me think that the love thy neighbor or just love each other is more about living a life fulfilled and for ones own benefit vs just following a command not being religious just something that further inspired me after reading this great post by op
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should check out imam alis quotes rings with some of these
GetMotivated,not_removed,highly recommend reading the tibetan book of living and dying if you found this post helpful
GetMotivated,not_removed,this needs cross posting to rgetdisciplined
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like that last one especially i would injure myself so much to try to push myself a little further otherwise itd be considered quitting hurt both knees id like to be able to think thats enough so i can stop for the day instead of why the fuck am i such a quitter thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,on your third point anybody interested in exploring that idea further should read outliers by malcolm gladwell totally destroys societys notion of success
GetMotivated,not_removed,these ideas are golden whoever you are sir you just changed one more life
GetMotivated,not_removed,saved
GetMotivated,not_removed,things health love life fuck the rest
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow i have goosebumps i have never related to anything more on reddit im actually about to email this to my mother right now kudos seriously for articulating this so well as an exaddict and formerly suicidal this got to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,all of these rules are great but the one that i think can really turn around someones life is your first rule especially if you add this secondary part that is contingent on the individuals support system and if there are forces in your life friends family coworkers religion ect that hinder your happiness and bring up the mistakes youve made in the past cut them the fuck out yesterday i did this recently back in april with certain members of my immediate family because whenever i was in contact with them they were a constant reminder of all the worst mistakes i have made and even after i reach goals that i strive they cut it down and undermine me my relationship and personal beliefs it made me emotionally ill to the point where i lacked any confidence and whenever something bad happened i apologized because i always had this feeling of guilt i dont need that and if there are people in your life who do this you sure as fuck dont need that either after simply not speaking or visiting im finally enjoying myself and am able to focus on what i need to do today to be better off tomorrow in all aspects of my life without the worry of being knocked down by those who were supposed to support me i dont know who came up with the idea that family deserve respect but when they show nothing of the short and do anything they can to cut you down sometimes the only solution is to not even give them the time of day i have my own life to live
GetMotivated,not_removed,i liked it specially point
GetMotivated,not_removed,op eloquent and amazing saving this post for sure
GetMotivated,not_removed,cool
GetMotivated,not_removed,i loved this especially the third point
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is straight outta the bible dude
GetMotivated,not_removed,after my fiancée left me a month ago with no reason this made me cry my eyes out were amazing people and nobody can tell us any different thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,some reddit wisdom that ive kept in mind lately you have options you can either continue to be miserable or you can just stop being angry at everyone and accept the way things are allow yourself to live when there are people professing how perfect their little life and family are on facebook and how having a family is the best thing ever you dont know what rotten shit is lying beneath the surface
GetMotivated,not_removed,amen to i realized that a while ago and am much better for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been handling myself pretty well starting about year ago but this post hits so spot on onto the things ive been unconsciously doing to keep myself sane its incredible how much i didnt realize all this this is a wonderful post and one other important thing i want to add is to not overthink anything if you have shit to do the hardest part is sitting your ass down to do it or getting up and doing it the barrier of entry is always the hardest part take your laptop and move your ass to a different spot take away your mouse put on your headphones blast some music and write those lab reports and do those projects i dont care if you have to scream fuck it to get started anything to get over that wall works and keep doing it youll go far fuck how hard it is fuck how easy it may or may not be just fuck it until it works
GetMotivated,not_removed,three simple ideas that changed my life i started peeing when i needed to pee instead of holding it in i pick my nose more now so its always clean i poop when i need to poop instead of holding it in
GetMotivated,not_removed,needed the shift in perspective thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,saving
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldr the human being is meant to bear the burden of hours happiness is not something you can pursue but instead the byproduct of doing the right thing the worlds idea of success is passive real success is active its good to remember the difference between stopping and quitting
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope youre happy you made my day
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you wise redditor for eloquently giving me the slap in the face and the gentle hug i needed today i am writing these wise words in my journal and will read them at the end of each day to remind me to be kind to myself be present and to not get distracted by the illusions of false happiness

GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,sufficient is the evil unto the day thereof king james bible i just means to focus on this hour day and not to worry about tomorrow or yesterday we have enough to do today alone
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks op will remember these as i barrel thru life everyday
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is all very insightful well done
GetMotivated,not_removed,getting off lexapro because i solved the primary cause of my depression but this post really gave me some things to think about thanks for the life advice im sure ill have plenty of use for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i needed this right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with the substance of these points but number i have some qualms with yes do by all means focus on the here and now and be present in the moment but also do consider the future you have to have longer term goals and desires for your life to complete you can live in the here and now and also have some foresight
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,i must sit on the couch more often
GetMotivated,not_removed,so where were you at before you followed this advice and where are you at now in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,as i see it the gist of the article is to live a disciplined life to never let go and sit back i think its easier said than done it leaves no room for mistakes although it sounds perfect i would like to bring to light the fact that most unhappiness in life originates from some or the other mistake or dissatisfaction whether its the wrong guy you dated or the wrong job you took do you think doing the right thing would solve for anything i would say in most cases one doesnt even know that the right thing is
GetMotivated,not_removed,the human being is meant to bear the burden of hours
GetMotivated,not_removed,piggy backing on idea when you get all your shit done and you do end up with a day where you can play video games for hours and eat a tub of ice cream because you planned ahead for a day like that you will go to be happy
GetMotivated,not_removed,for those with further interest in idea read by eckhart tolle nothing has fundamentally changed my life like that book and i can safely say ive never felt better
GetMotivated,not_removed,these are good is different for some people though for most that is true but some mainly need to be forward thinking it is our strength people who do better thinking about the now should take that role there are also those who mainly should be thinking about the past these people have ridiculously good memory whereas the forward thinkers have the shittiest memory none are better than the other overall
GetMotivated,not_removed,hijacking this to say that the second point is about the difference between pleasure and happiness pleasure eating ice cream playing videogames etc makes you feel good shortterm but never longterm true happiness is longterm and involves not necessarily feeling good shortterm not eating cake etc but good longterm in reflection it is the result of sacrifice
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats right you just have to start doing the right thing to add always and everyday try to improve yourself bit by bit not big steps always be the first man to do somethinganything good at least once in whole lifetime it doesnt have to be the first in the world but can be on a your own street level

GetMotivated,not_removed,i need to look this sub
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah im thinking about starting a new religion about this guys post isnt it weird how living in the present is a real thing like people really find happiness that way in tangible ways by actually doing it not just talking about it its hard to explain that just clicked for me
GetMotivated,not_removed,i regret the past every minute of every day particularly when i should be happy its hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope that i feel this way soon thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,this comment resonates with me right now respect fellow pnwdweller edit spelling
GetMotivated,not_removed,heres to you and ops first point the only article ive ever saved to read again because it is in my experience so utterly important to die daily after the manner of st paul ensures the resurrection of a new man who makes each day the epitome of a life
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a viewpoint ive been finding helpful with age as well everything you do accomplish move towards in life is a result of tiny steps as corny as it might sound every journey begins with the first step and then repeating that process its been a bitter lesson for me that i kept waiting for the right mood to set in for some future me that is somehow more inspired or willing to do things that perfect future me never came and never will come i have to learn how to be my imperfect me and start moving and most of all enjoying the process of failing at something because its the first step to becoming better
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a beautiful way to sum up a lot of lifes most challenging and rewarding experiences im in the meaty bit of living day by day with a small baby and its pretty much how he lives life which means as a parent you effectively have to live the same way through the hard days and the good days they dont last forever so enjoy them too
GetMotivated,not_removed,this has been a big one for me there are times i am virtually scratching and clawing to get through each dayhourmoment and one foot in front of the other is how ive had to approach a lot of things while everyone around me is focused and aiming so much more long term it sort of encompasses both point here at least the way i look at it one foot in front of the other one day at a time but also just working at doing the right thing one thing at a time chipping away at that laundry list
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had a run in with it last night i took the whole pint down in one sitting its impossible to put down ben jerry really know what the fuck theyre doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,halo top ice cream entire pint is only calories
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think its okay to gorge on a tub of ice cream occasionally we only have so much willpower
GetMotivated,not_removed,the big ice cream cone in the sky will it ever be an eternal ice cream cone or is it always going to melt you gotta keep eating it yet it melts melts thats the problem you gotta keep eating it cuz it will melt then its gone you know that taste in your mouth when you finish you want a glass of water right then you have a glass of water theres that bloaty feeling then youre ready for the next one to get rid of that one lets take a walk you take a walk its cold out lets have some hot chocolate yes lets have some on on on its called life you see the opposite of craving is saying baby this is the way it is yeah ok here now this is it i accept the here now fully as it is right at this moment
GetMotivated,not_removed,eating alot of ice cream makes me go to the bathroom
GetMotivated,not_removed,god i wish i had some ice cream now since i need to shed like pounds i have a very strict diet its abysmally hard to not just go and buy
GetMotivated,not_removed,sargent large george the ice cream gorge
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes ill reread wendell berrys the peace of wild things when im having one those nights when despair for the world grows in me and i wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and my childrens lives may be i go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds i come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief i come into the presence of still water and i feel above me the dayblind stars waiting with their light for a time i rest in the grace of the world and am free
GetMotivated,not_removed,ever practice mindfulness
GetMotivated,not_removed,about once a month i end up ruminating till in the morning i get really angry and scared and send someone a message telling them they were a selfish twat i feel like shit the next morning because of what i did and apologise to no affect it really sucks you have good days and bad days i dont beat myself up as much anymore and just move on i think the relationship you have with yourself is one of the most important ones it takes a lot of work maybe were right when we think were a dick but it doesnt help anyone for us to think that way it just makes things worse i learned that i was sensitive it makes me afraid a lot never forget what you are the rest of the world will not wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you tyrion lannister
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cant get much done in life if you only work on the days you feel good jerry west
GetMotivated,not_removed,it may take a long time to reach your goal the rest of your life since the goal usually keeps moving but it doesnt take very long before each individual workout improves your mood once youre in at least okish shape nothing feels better than having the endorphins pumping and the sweat dripping off your face
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a great story and personally im the kind of person who would prefer a possum in my bathtub than a fancy car in my driveway any day
GetMotivated,not_removed,his family probably envies his old shitty house that is actually filled to the walls with love and meaning theyre just too emotionally frail to admit it
GetMotivated,not_removed,first time to use it on posts aside from nsfwgif
GetMotivated,not_removed,havent had the urge to save something until now i didnt even know there was a save button thanks for mentioning it
GetMotivated,not_removed,every single person should read proverbs christian or not also ecclesiastes you will learn that the nature of humans despite technology is absolutely still the same edit enjoy your life with those whom you love all the days of this meaningless life that god has given you under the sun—all your meaningless days for this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might for in the realm of the dead where you are going there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom i have seen something else under the sun the race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned but time and chance happen to them all moreover no one knows when their hour will come as fish are caught in a cruel net or birds are taken in a snare so people are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them this stuff is very good
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i read i was reminded of the lords prayer give us this day though i could have just as easily thought of the buddhist emphasis of being present in the moment and living fully when i read i immediately thought of krishnas exhortation in the baghavad gita to forego the fruits of ones labours and allow karma to run its course clearly some tenets of ancient religion can still have an important role to play in the motivation of the modern world
GetMotivated,not_removed,its also very aa
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually a great comparison you cant surf on that same wave your whole life there comes a time it crashes on the shore and its up to you to either stay at the beach and wait until youll get tired of it eventually or you paddle back into the sea to catch a new wave
GetMotivated,not_removed,good on you acceptance is the answer it would be awful to die without ever having known how to live i am recovering from several addictions and have found my life has improved enormously just by taking it a day at a time and following a step programme living is really about learning how to give please if you get a chance listen to whitney houstons song step by step
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes youre right implementation of these ideas is a whole different animal and probably much more specific to each individual i didnt go into detail there because it would require way too much context about my boring life and what was effective for me i also dont mean to suggest that because these ideas are simple they are somehow easy as i tried to say in the last part there will be days when even if you devote yourself religiously to these principles they just wont click for you and thats ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats like antimotivation but its not all wrong how you think about a circumstance determines how you feel about it the grass usually looks greener on the other side of the fence but if you were to hop over youd still be you and thats what determines your state of being if youre a miserable fuck changing your job or house isnt really going to do a lot to affect that youll still be you i think the idea is that you find something you enjoy and pay attention to that regardless of what you do to pay the bills just continue to feed that enjoyment because no one is going to just hand you happiness unless for you happiness is a chocolate muffin from the girl at starbucks but realistically you have to pay attention to what delights you either that or you could just be miserable pay attention to that and make your entire life about misery sounds great
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes yes i am
GetMotivated,not_removed,very buddha much path
GetMotivated,not_removed,were all buddhists
GetMotivated,not_removed,money buys happiness just ask rich people
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad i could help
GetMotivated,not_removed,cannot upvote enough i fucking love one punch man
GetMotivated,not_removed,so glad to hear it helped
GetMotivated,not_removed,doing the thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not that you shouldnt plan ahead but you should take every project and cut it up into daily portions like walking a mile isnt about walking a mile its about one step at a time eventually you will walk the full mile one step at a time a lot of people overwhelm themselves thinking of the grand scheme of things i cant make an entire movie i cant build an entire house i can clean my entire room not all at once you cant but you can do the first step and then the second step and then the third step eventually you will complete the whole project but just dont treat it like its an all at once marathon its something you do one step at a time and once youve done your portion for the day you can relax and forget about it until tomorrow
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is a very decent point i had never considered the matter from that angle before
GetMotivated,not_removed,like i tried to say these ideas may not be for everyone just stuff that worked for me thanks for reading and replying
GetMotivated,not_removed,its more about positioning yourself in relationship to the day in front of you and not some distant future say you want to become a dentist you can obsessively think and fantasize about becoming a dentist and beat yourself up for all the things you did in the past that prevented you from achieving your goal or you can use the day in front of you to make a small step toward achieving your goal pulling up an informational website applying for a class calling your friends dad who is a dentist and asking him if hed like to get coffee some time to talk about his profession its not so much about never looking forward or planning for the future but rather accepting that the moment in front of you right now is all that you have to control so control it
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad it helped youre right on about making every day as productive and full as you can
GetMotivated,not_removed,honored
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow im so glad it helped i really had no idea if anyone would even respond
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree and everyone needs to figure out what the right thing for them is i used an example of calling your mom back for but maybe for you the right thing is to block their number or find a way to actively let go of the guilt of not responding if theres anything i would add after reading all these respons es it would be some version of you are not alone even if you feel like youre the only person on earth the fact that this post has gotten any traction whatsoever shows that alot of people are going through something similar thanks for your reply
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad i could help keep your head up friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad to help
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,im going to sound like a douchebag for saying this but most of the time when i read those motivational pics or memes its done by people who are high on success or rich ass motherfuckers trying to be tony robbins but ops suggestion especially number feels so real youre the truth
GetMotivated,not_removed,we had a talk about this at our school it was about delayed gratification basically exactly what you just covered didnt think much of it at the time but its really started to relate to me and my insane levels of procrastination
GetMotivated,not_removed,there have been studies on this they found that happiness is quite separate from meaningfulness pursuing happiness is about being a taker and pursuing meaningfulness is about being a giver its very hard to balance life so that you can have both at the same time would you like to know more
GetMotivated,not_removed,look i theoretically get this but when youre seriously depressed all you have is pleasure ive tried happiness its not happening its not coming back i cant think of a more than hour period in the last several years when ive been happy
GetMotivated,not_removed,just to play devils advocate but doesnt foregoing pleasure in order to attain happiness in the future directly contradict the idea of living in one hour period and not letting the future burden you or whatever seems to contradict point number one
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree video games in moderation make me pretty damn happy consistently
GetMotivated,not_removed,happiness often means thinking of results in the future which is why i disagree with point no
GetMotivated,not_removed,what is it that would categorize longterm through your point of view
GetMotivated,not_removed,there are no shortcuts to happiness there are only shortcuts to pleasure
GetMotivated,not_removed,im gonna hijack yours to say happiness is not long term youre thinking joy happiness is based upon happenstance you dont truly control happenstance but you can control joy its much deeper dont pursue happiness bc it is temporary and fleeting pursue joy
GetMotivated,not_removed,but what if you dont know what the right thing is likei seriously feel like i dont know what actions makes me happy
GetMotivated,not_removed,wubba lubba dubstep
GetMotivated,not_removed,op i am in a part of life that i feel is in the middle im desperate for change i need to change for tje better those three rules of life are amazing and believe in them so well however ive got such a negative routine down mentally thays its out of habit and when i begin a new day i almost forget im not supposed to be thinking in my usual way im not sire of this makes sense how did you remind yourself of the new rules life when you felt stuck and didnt like where you were in life for example did you use sticky notes around the house
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats great yeah theres some really solid practical advice in there
GetMotivated,not_removed,its called zen buddhism
GetMotivated,not_removed,look into buddhism the point about detachment is already incorporated into their philosophy and its key
GetMotivated,not_removed,just for myself when im in the present i notice how right things are it could be that my body doesnt hurt or im not hungry or super tired maybe regular tired like the pleasant feelings of being ok are totally forgotten about and taken for granted
GetMotivated,not_removed,same here
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have to truly forgive yourself and let it go dont try and hold on to it because it cant be changed once you make peace with your past and forgive yourself thats when everything changed for me
GetMotivated,not_removed,totally agree with this i like to think of it as a case of divide and conquer at the personal level i discipline myself with the following mantra if you wont do even the smallest thing to get you closer to your goals today why should tomorrow be any different
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait pint those little containers arent single serving
GetMotivated,not_removed,it comes in pints
GetMotivated,not_removed,i mean thats only like a little over calories heck you couldve ate pints and been ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly just dont make it an every day kinda thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,no its not ice cream makes you fat
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know what that was but i liked it
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck yes ram dass
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe you just need those lactose pills to help you digest it
GetMotivated,not_removed,hows you know my name
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for sharing this its beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yeah also in the first year you can almost see the difference week by week and theres no greater motivation than seeing results
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a reason why the bible stuck for so long its probably a damn good book
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone who shed his religion and was faced with the absurdity of life without a higher power and found some sort of solace in the myth of sisyphus that first paragraph you quoted from ecclesiastes is oddly camusian
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is exactly me right now and its exactly where addiction comes in for me it fills the void that is left by the pain ive experienced as a child its a slow process towards health learning new skills taking the time to reevaluate what happened and moving forward sadly my last counselor just exactly told me that since i already understand all those problems he cant see why i truly need help its quite a bummer when people just expect you to act on good knowledge for sure sometimes its just necessary to get up and move but for long lasting change it takes a bit more when you suddenly feel like a child again confronted with thousand options and none of them present you with relief its hard to stay balanced
GetMotivated,not_removed,k here we go then
GetMotivated,not_removed,perfectly said thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,here i agree i even find well put its the previous the burdens of the future arent yours either that i found misleading i guess
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre completely right everyones situation is different the examples you included really did drive your points home everything youve stated are pretty universal in the sense that im sure most people at some point in their life has felt either alone empty or as if theyre living an unfulfilled life i hope this post gets front page i think everyone should read and have these ideas in their head theres a really cool idea behind that lokai bracelet that has water from the dead sea lowest point mt everest the highest point and the idea is that even when youre at your highest let the lowest keep you humble and when your at your lowest the water from mt everest is supposed to give you hope and all the beads around it is supposed to be finding the balance between hopeful and humble just a cool idea in case you want to check it out kinda hippyish but intriguing thanks for the post op i believe its going to help a lot of people out when they need it
GetMotivated,not_removed,op posted something that actually motivates people properly instead of some advicerichperson shit kudos to op
GetMotivated,not_removed,you would prefer taking advice on how to be successful by someone who isnt or about hapiness by someone living a sad unachieved to himself life i dont really get your comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not because those rich ass motherfuckers are insanly smart and realized this its because they have everything and just then when they shoud be totaly happy they notice that this world and its media controled idea of being happy is totaly messed up
GetMotivated,not_removed,talking about delayed gratification there is a famous experiment where kids had to choose between eating marshmallow now or marshmallows in minutes apparently the kids who could wait minutes got higher sat scores later on httpsenwikipediaorgwikistanfordmarshmallowexperiment
GetMotivated,not_removed,we had the same talk in my school about grade ive thought about this in a way but op put this into words l cannot fathom
GetMotivated,not_removed,if can
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is only so much you can do for yourself when you are depressed if you have ok habits ok diet ok exercise it can just be a chemical imbalance and medicines might help off meds i feel like im always walking the line only a small thing has to go wrong and ill spiral down and need to fight and use any extra energy to get out of it again a small thing could just be a rejection or bad diet for days or getting the flu with meds its like i have a little cushion i can get the flu and feel like crap physically and mentally but once im better im also better mentally a rejection sucks and hurts as always but its not the beginning of a downward spiral
GetMotivated,not_removed,as said above pleasure dont make you happy thinking its all youve got is the problem go clean the sidewalk
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is possible to find happiness without experiencing pleasure and while being in the midst of depression true happiness isnt even really an emotion its a deeper and ultimately more satisfying sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,they are a great diversion i like them enough to even make some
GetMotivated,not_removed,making an impact a difference providing value in some way studying sucks but after years of it some people will know that their work is saving lives or at least improving the quality of it others will run businesses that improve the quality of life of those around them on the extreme end you have elon musk who is shifting the worlds dependence on fossil fuels and wants to make the human race interplanetary in case an extinction event threatens mankind i can imagine people like that come home after a long day of work feel good and cant wait to get back at it again the next day
GetMotivated,not_removed,the right thing is not supposed to be what makes you happy what makes you happy is a byproduct so you only need to know what the right thing is
GetMotivated,not_removed,not op but sticky notes actually work i completely agree that habits are second nature so youll gradually slide back into them until you make new ones thats not easy to do without actively trying to do it and without reminders its easy to miss the fact that youre just doing what youve always done i actually use my phone for reminders of things i want to work on or at the very least think about i can name my alarms on my phone so i think ill name them after these rules so the first thing i read every morning reminds me what i want to be focusing on
GetMotivated,not_removed,try meditation itll help alot to clear the mind and bring focus headspace app is a great tool you can use you just need to do it minutes daily and youll see the change yourself i assure you rmeditation regarding your sticky notes question i use them alot i call it accountability i make a note of the list of things i need to do and at the end of the day keep track of what all ive completed
GetMotivated,not_removed,at first i found that changing is difficult because really i was in such poor routines for a long time so everyday everything i would do better i had to make a conscious effort to steer myself in the right direction i guess what im trying to say is its okay if youre overly aware of your efforts you may even feel silly breaking your bad habits thinking oh this wont make a difference but it will and eventually itll become second nature for you doing the right things so heres a book id really recommend reading it may come off as a self help book for people with painbody aches etc but its not its a medical guide to body pain now your thinking well i dont have body pain or maybe you do and what does this have to do with anything for me i began reading it for my back and shoulder pains but then i realized this is way more then just pain it explains where all my anger anxiety depression etc really comes from and how our amazing brains handle all of that i cannot express enough how great this book was for my life the mindbody prescription by john e sarno good luck to you sometimes we need to fight with our own minds to get some clarity
GetMotivated,not_removed,not op but the power of habit by charles duhigg was a helpful book for me it basically breaks down the spiral of habits big good and bad into triggers and feedback loops its been a while since ive read the book but the idea is you first identity the trigger eg i have a rough day at work the action youre trying to change eg i dont pay enough attention to my wife but instead play videos games and the reinforcement eg she doesnt get mad and i get to not think about work then assuming you want to change that habit you can go about it in a few different ways changing the reinforcement in my example i could talk to my wife and ask her to get mad just an example i would never do this switching the trigger to something else i could walk my dog play guitar read a book etc work at removing the trigger this is the probably the hardest one since its often less in your control
GetMotivated,not_removed,you too friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,same here subbed this looks like exactly what i need right now thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,absolutely you never appreciate feeling good until you dont every day you need to appreciate the feelings you have that day
GetMotivated,not_removed,ops rule brought it to the front of my mind but it didnt really click until i read this comment right now im totally okay and thats what really matters it makes me happy to just be in this present because there are so many possibilities open to me when im not worrying about the future thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait you mean people eat less than a pint of ben and jerrys at a time
GetMotivated,not_removed,only if youre a six foot tall man short women barely need more than that for the whole day
GetMotivated,not_removed,be here now ram dass
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,true and in the years that follow i found that there is great happiness to be found in the relative ease with which you just stick with the habit of working out very low risk of injury since you can just stick with known routines it took a couple of years before it really became part of who i am but it was totally worth it
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,advicerichperson shit unhappy quit your job and travel all across the world travelling gives you happiness and it makes you a better person hate you life well change it quit your job and travel anywhere you want for years and decide where you want to be in the end no love just start looking hard enough start eating healthy working out have hobbies and go back to college and do some other things that you will never have enough time for because you have to work hours a week just live in the moment thats the worst one if your moment is the worst moment of your life living only in it is not going to make you feel good its obviously written by someone who is happy at the moment or otherwise they wouldnt suggest that shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you are using the societal definition of success where it is defined by outcomes then its possible the successful person may simply be more lucky outcome is shaped by the person and external factors surrounding that person since external factors are not something a person can always control it is not always helpful to go to sucesssful people for advice tips on how to change yourself as a person is more beneficial
GetMotivated,not_removed,so youre telling me that kids who eat more marshmallows get higher sat scores no wondering i did bad
GetMotivated,not_removed,if the child doesnt have good reason to trust the promise of the future marshmallows eg home life is chaotic parents are flaky then she wouldnt obviously be irrational or compulsive for choosing the marshmallow now
GetMotivated,not_removed,this video briefly covers it
GetMotivated,not_removed,cant be bothered edit man reddit always hates my best jokes you guys are a tough crowd
GetMotivated,not_removed,and i am right behind you i know exactly what you mean life tips from other people is more than meaningless to me i suspect its even doing more harm than anything i am constantly reminded about how i can not maintain a suggested routine a focused state of mind and daily chores mostly due to my mental condition in which i can be tipped over by random stuff shifting emotions and mood attention disorder issues besides the meds the thing i found most helpful to me is accepting my situation my abilities and limits
GetMotivated,not_removed,plus one for sticky notes a physical reminder for your brain it helps that the reminder comes from outside your brain you listen like its your bro from the past
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a really great practice as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,calories one day aint going to make a difference especially considering that in all likelihood it displaced calories you would have eaten otherwise so the net amount is even less than that its all about diet not individual meals if its not a habit youre fine if say you were living in a nutrition vacuum and the calories didnt displace any others it takes calories to make up a lb of fat so really its nothing to sweat when i was studying nutrition was the number the consensus is now more than that
GetMotivated,not_removed,if only the obnoxious atheists of reddit would give it a read youve been on here for more than a year and havent seen that most already have this is kind of surprising to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,of course it has some wisdom within it and yeah you have to take the good out of everything but that doesnt change that it ultimately is a sham religion leading many people away from finding the real truth to life whatever it may be i dont like atheists being hateful about this but i do like our culture progessing philosophically instead of keeping an archaic disproven religion going
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually living in the moment is a key concept of buddhism and mindfulness when you can live in the flow and observe it without ascribing goodbad happymiserable judgement on it youve taken a large step towards enlightenment
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the great advice i shall let you know how all of these go my goal is to be happy by tuesday
GetMotivated,not_removed,no love just start looking hard enough start eating healthy working out have hobbies and go back to college and do some other things that you will never have enough time for because you have to work hours a week you can easily make time for working out and eating healthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,the fact you cant read that paragraph correctly might have something to do with the sat scores
GetMotivated,not_removed,great joke actually its just really hard to get for people who are looking for definition of stoicism
GetMotivated,not_removed,the thing i found most helpful to me is accepting my situation my abilities and limits this is one of the greatest pressures you can lift from your shoulders i was in a position where everybody else was better than me at everything and i always felt like i was always step behind it discouraged me to a point where i just kept on falling into an abyss and never thought i could get out then i realized maybe i just suck i accepted itbut then embraced it anything i do now i succeed at because i enjoy the struggle of not being able to do something it could be something millions of people have already done but that doesnt matter because i havent done it before it would have discouraged me and i would have just gave up the happiness of the end goal is just an illusion a mirage the real happiness comes from looking back at how far youve come and looking towards the future of how much you have to accomplish and keep moving forward no matter what
GetMotivated,not_removed,i suppose you just have to try and remember youre running your own race against yourself and nobody else i suppose you could still heed on ops last point you can still achieve things you might have to stop sometimes and thats okay
GetMotivated,not_removed,absolutely love this explanation you listen like its your bro from the past absolutely perfect
GetMotivated,not_removed,but that doesnt change that it ultimately is a sham religion leading many people away from finding the real truth to life whatever it may be you dont see the hypocrisy of your own statement to many if not most people your atheism is just as much of a sham to us as theism is to you its the same smug attitude of finally understanding the truth just in a different form until you fully open your eyes and realize the potentiality of being wrong regardless of belief and dont shut down an ideology entirely youll continue to be as much a zealot and slave to your atheism as many evangelical fundies are to their bastardization of god
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sad for you the answers are in front of you and you still turn away
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you i will remember live in the moment two of my rules are dont look over your shoulder and the effect of an act is its real intent
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh why arent you happy now be happy you make me feel bad now
GetMotivated,not_removed,it was a joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,kinda along the same line as the three selves past self might let you down but you cant get mad at him or hate him because he is trying really hard future self is someone you need to look out for as present self you want to set him up for success and you dont want to be an ass by letting him down all the time
GetMotivated,not_removed,its planting a seed thats about all we can do
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel sad for you if you see the world in front of you as it is and still turn away to find the answers in book
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have never heard the effect of an act is its real intent but that has to be the realest advice ive ever heard thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you elaborate on the effect of an act is its real intent i dont understand its meaning
GetMotivated,not_removed,youll never believe this your response made me happy i know you think this might be a temporary thing but you would be wrong this is a forever thing

GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful write up completely agree having struggled with addictions through my life lol youre probably like myself when you hearsee someone refer to some trivial bullshit app store games being my biggest gripe as addicting fuckin drives me crazy when i see shit like that
GetMotivated,not_removed,omg this this is what i needed to read today thank you

GetMotivated,not_removed,just curious what was your addiction op
GetMotivated,not_removed,i second this ive been struggling with pmo ever since i was years old im now and this has probably been one of the most self motivating articles ive seen on reddit definitely hit home
GetMotivated,not_removed,everybodys got itwhat about you

GetMotivated,not_removed,a ship is safest at harbor but thats not why ships are made
GetMotivated,not_removed,i appreciate the sentiment but this is not really helpful advice everyone always wishes theyd screwed around more in the past but that completely disregards what not screwing around has wrought
GetMotivated,not_removed,id rather not look back on my life and regret anything im and feel i am in complete control if i wanted to eat ice cream and get fat and unhealthy i would if i wanted to travel i would if i didnt have bills to pay and people who you know what nevermind you get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats an easy way to think when she doesnt actually have to work part time jobs to support herself thinking that you can just spend your days doing nothing but relaxing is such a first world entitled way of looking at life
GetMotivated,not_removed,from httpsenwikipediaorgwikimomentspoem the first known version of the text was authored by american humorist and cartoonist don herold and published by college humor before or perhaps early that year under the title id pick more daisies herolds text is in prose and it lacks the melancholic tone of the spanish poem eg if i had my life to live over id try to make more mistakes next time i would relax i would limber up i would be sillier than i have been this trip i know of very few things that i would take seriously i would be crazier i would be less hygienic i would take more chances i would take more trips i would climb more mountains and swim more rivers i would burn up more gasoline i would eat more ice cream and less bran
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpssitesgooglecomacuentosyalgomascomcuentosyalgomashomesivolvieraanacerjorgeluisborges this is a badly translated ripoff of the original poem in spanish by renowned author httpsenmwikipediaorgwikijorgeluisborges the last line of the poem is missing but now you see i am and i know that i am dying
GetMotivated,not_removed,sheinking im already small enough on the one thing that matters
GetMotivated,not_removed,the second half of the second paragraph reminds me of the time i lived in munich those people had such hardcore walking boots and backpacks just for walking around their tiny city

GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for posting i like reading the wisdom that comes with age

GetMotivated,not_removed,this reminds me of something poemforyoursprog wrote on another post of similar theme i should have hurried youth in truth and moved more quickly on i should have made the most of youth before the time was gone i should have followed fancy free before it thought to fade i should have picked a good degree or found myself a trade i should have stopped to stare above to share anothers dreams i should have never welcomed love and lost it all it seems no matter what the aim or end no matter what you do regrets are part of life my friend dont let them conquer you it really moved me maybe itll speak to you as well httpswwwredditcomuserpoemforyoursprog
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for pointing this out it is exactly what i was thinking as i was reading this sometimes the rich wish they could be poor
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think this resonates most as more of us probably fall into the camp of making enough mistakes that we feel this doesnt apply to us ive been living off the cusp for years and although ive traveled many places on earth and kissed my fair share of girls even before i feel a present regret of wishing i had applied myself more to studies at an early age got into an ivy league on scholarships and solidified a lucrative career everything is just balance i guess be sillier sure make more mistakes but also apply yourself to today to create a better tomorrow continuously
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i got pretty silly i got pretty silly off the fucking codeine and sizzurp if i had a do over i think ill be come a fucking accountant
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah so either way you regret life
GetMotivated,not_removed,great now i have diabeetus thanks nadine
GetMotivated,not_removed,thinking that you can just spend your days doing nothing but relaxing is such a first world entitled way of looking at life its sweet that you think in the first world many people have that luxury
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope httpseswikipediaorgwikiinstantes
GetMotivated,not_removed,munich a tiny city not sure i agree with that statement

GetMotivated,not_removed,dont worry about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,realize and accept that you will regret your choices no matter what therefore there is nothing to regret kierkegaard was a smart motherfucker
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you find out let me know
GetMotivated,not_removed,i accept that ive always made the decision id make in that situation with the information i had at the time you cant be upset at someone when you know they did the best the could with their skills abilities knowledge and resources disappointed at the outcome maybe but thats all perspective ive been through enough shit to accept that i am where i am because i did the best i could with the information skills abilities and knowledge i had some people have better yes but a lot of people have much worse if you own your decisions and their consequences they arent regrets just realities
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the correction it was a poem i read so long ago that i never verified its authenticity yet the image provided is indeed plagiarism it turns out that the original author was a humorist called don herold the problem with internet quotes is that you cant always depend on their accuracy abraham lincoln

GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure this post is motivating me
GetMotivated,not_removed,is this just a hooli employee complaining about gavin belson that livestock comment seems telling
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for sharing this i need to fallow these so i regret nothing when on my deathbed
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i wanna be a musician and idk what do do with that considering it will be hard to live doing that im conflicted
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like i do all but one of these but i still feel rather unachieved only two weeks ago i had a very close friend over the phone tell me it was time to grow up and start doing jobs that paid better that ill suck i have two part time jobs just finishing uni coown an entertainment band and starting up a private teaching business i had applied for a retail job which i had done for a year before for me it was soul destroying as i was worried about the lack of student loans and shifts i wasnt getting from the part time jobs i took the worst offense from my friends advice and decided i was going to make my own road ahead of me she might do a job she hates to cover everything but that doesnt have to be my life
GetMotivated,not_removed,im no expert on this topic but i wanted to say this happiness is fleeting and only a feeling feelings come and go no matter what you do with your life whereas maybe its more helpful to your wellbeing to reach for fulfillment will going for your dreams benefit you in the long run im not telling you to take a specific road just ask yourself real questions and really answer them based on you being completely honest and realistic with yourself take into account others opinions and then do with them what you wish discard keep etc ultimately its not anyone elses opinionstance that matters its yours and thats an amazing thing maybe others see things that youve missed and maybe all they wanted you to do is really think and feel things through there is really no one size fits all on how to live your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had the same issue so i went for a degree instead id probably be happier as a broke musician than i am as a broke graduate looking for work so id say pursue your dreams give it all youve got
GetMotivated,not_removed,preach keep on your path sounds great
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow thanks for this i really have been contemplating all of this before like no matter what i do i feel ill be happy if i choose to be but i just dont really know what direction to go because of all the options is all i want to meet new people and i feel stuck in a rut and doing know how to get out i guess i just need to meditate on some of this and see where it goes from there
GetMotivated,not_removed,i may finish a marketing degree what are you in school for
GetMotivated,not_removed,i graduated with a software engineering bachelors i was told it was easy to find highpaying work in this field so far no luck landing a job its been a year
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn really im in web development at the moment and contemplating between that and marketing thats unfortunate you couldnt find a job in that field
GetMotivated,not_removed,im still looking everyday cant really give up as its all ive got and im in silicon valley so youd think ill find something someday the depressionanxiety dont make it any easier to deal with and chances are theyre part of the reason its tough to get hired when you dont have much to show off other than school projects its tough to will yourself to make more things when the depression literally wont let you sigh
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn im sorry to hear that ive been really anxious about life lately too feel free to dm me anytime
GetMotivated,not_removed,quit i was in the same position and i have never looked back i make less money now but im so much happier no job is worth ruining your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,take time off and get a hobby if you can find a new job i took nearly a month off and it really helped recage myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,update your resume and apply apply apply i am in the same situation at a deadend job and its only getting worse i started applying to any job even peripherally related to what i do now took this last week off and im dreading going back to work this coming week but i have a very promising interview on thursday so hopefully my last two weeks will coincide with thanksgiving and my new job will be my christmas present to myself remember you cant afford to make other peoples problems your problems if your boss is shit and the job is killing you and thats what depression is a slow death you need to line up your exit now and split as soon as possible keep telling yourself its just for a little while as soon as you get another offer take it
GetMotivated,not_removed,find something to do outside of work distance yourself from work when you go home or have days off take trips and enjoy life hope this helps
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive noticed with time that my work is just sucking me dry its unique to this year because we got a new boss and everyone is miserable with what he has put in place he also demeans and dismisses everyone i am a counselor at my work so im a inundated with unhappy people and it seems to be getting worse i come home and have no desire to do anything and only want to isolate myself as a way of recharging to a certain degree but im not feeling recharged only worse
GetMotivated,not_removed,your work should never be a place where you feel demoralized i have taken one of the biggest risk of my career months ago i was with a company where negativity was high and you had to watch your back all the time high positions where given to people who easily manipulated and those managers who stood up for doing the morally right thing was made the bad yes i was depressed and couldnt take going to work anymore which frustrated me eventually i decided that i cant let others control the way i feel i cant live my life based on others opinions if i want change i got to make that change i applied for new jobs went for interviews but nothing came from it i realized that i was still so frustrated going to work everyday so i took the risk i resigned from work with a months notice i felt all that stress and tension i had leave me instantly what an amazing relief but i had a challenge i had bills to be payed and in a month im going to be out of a job i remained positive and believed im my worth more served my notice with no stress and a smile on my face i was positive and happy again i got a call weeks before my notice period was up from a friend and a business owner he called for my advise on a job he was doing and thats when i told him i wont be working for my current company anymore all he said was lets meet and now im the general manager for his business we growing so rapidly the staff are happy and positive there is lots of work to get done but im happy being part of a great team that i can groom my advise to you is find what makes you happy and be positive ignore all the negativity and live life the way you feel is right you have greatness in you and never let someone tell you otherwise best of luck😀
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with the other comments something needs to change for you and as they will be unlikely to let a new hire go if they are performing ok and the company isnt going down hill it may be you leaving im not sure how bad it is for you but seeking another medical professionals opinion may be helpful in reducing the impact you feel i wish i had done this prior to my breaking point it then caused my job performance to suffer and i was let go as the others have said a new job can help out a lot even if it is a pay cut
GetMotivated,not_removed,i drink
GetMotivated,not_removed,exact same situation as you ive never been so demoralized and depressed its really slowly killing me i have made the decision to quit in december once the bonus is paid out regardless if i have another job or not nothing is worth the awful physical and mental toll that a shitty job takes on your health take solace in the fact that i and many others share your pain stay strong my friend it wont last forever take the courage to quit and find another job
GetMotivated,not_removed,i spent ten years in a job that did this to me at its worst i made a playlist of songs that ramped me up for what i was about to deal with and sang loudly along with the songs on the way to work on the way home i listened to a playlist of songs that made me happy or content and sang along on the go to work list i recommend this in my head i would hear it when dealing with jerks at work and it helped me minimize their power it was on my go home list too the catchy music over a montage of work garbage exiting my brain helped calm me down before i got home also update your resume and keep your eyes open for something new if the changes at work dont improve you will want to be prepared to leave
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was in a similar situation basically by staying in my place of work for months more than i should have i caused myself damage which has so far proved irreversible and crushing quit when you have the chance and move on to something new i wish i had
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit went back to uni and got a better job not only am i happier but slightly better paid and have much better career prospects
GetMotivated,not_removed,you need to get out im in the same position and im making every effort to find a new less stressful job on a different career path its ruining my life and relationships and i cant keep doing this youll regret it for years if you stay trust me for your own sake find something new as soon as possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am in a similar situation i decided to act like im happy and that i love my job while fast and furiously applying for a new job i was able to get one of the directors in my current area to refer me to a director in another department because of my acting i had an interview last week so ill know this week or next if i got the new job good luck edit i view acting as part of my job now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had a high paying job that sucked my soul and finally quit now i have a low paying job that sucks my soul plus the anxiety brought on by the struggles of poverty not to mention social anxiety and the haunting thoughts that everyone i graduated with is doing better than me i just dont know what to do
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agreeim going to just do my best to get through it and then find something else as soon as possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,just remember you only have three choices accept it change it or leave it when its hard at work always remember you have choices
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love reading your story and the success you found isnt it amazing you can work really hard and crazy but it you like your work the people you are with and the accomplishments you are making life cant get any better you can be at a job that is easy not demanding but toxic and its the most miserable feeling in the world love your storythanks for sharing and congratulations on this new adventure
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for that inputyes im concerned about my emotional health and dont want to hit a breaking point this thread has been helpful just to hear input from others who have experienced something similar
GetMotivated,not_removed,always always have another gig set up or enough cash to help you through especially considering your timing people generally wont be hiring again in most fields until around april january to march is a dead zone for job prospects
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is an excellent ideathe music is kind of like gearing up for it and then decompressing from it im going to do that i can also play music in my office so im going to do that yesi work in a school so im thinking i can start looking for something else about feb i think there is going to be a mass exodus at my school which is sadamazing people the new admin team has destroyed moral ive never seen anything like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,since i am a school counselor i feel like if i resign that could be the end of my career in this field however i almost feel like my health is in danger part of the reason im struggling is that a kid head butted me when i was assisting my vice principal im on workers comp with restrictions but those arent given any consideration so im carrying a lot of emotional weight because the teachers are very unhappy and then im not physically my principal honestly is the worst principal ive ever worked forthat is why the campus is in turmoil im just not sure what to do but i feel like that personally im not doing well emotionally im searching for answers thank you for your feedback
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats terrific thank you for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive decided this weekend that i am going to leave this jobim going to take several of these suggestions to cope and go through the motions but prepare for an exit thanks for your feedback
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is great advice im going to do just thatacting as part of my job description just thinking about that makes me feel better
GetMotivated,not_removed,find a medium paying job that doesnt suck your soul but dont quit yet when you find it go to that job
GetMotivated,not_removed,you do whats best for you dont worry about your fellow graduates comparing yourself to others is a straight path to depression unless youre comparing yourself to this guy httpswwwtravismillsorg
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you that is poignantim going to use that as my mantrai know i cant accept it so ill see what i can change but with my eyes to look for opportunities to leave
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you so much 😀 i hope my story inspires people to never settle for what people and life throws at them we can all accomplish our dreams and dream jobs by just being positive and work hard towards your goals 😀
GetMotivated,not_removed,this does concern me however i simply cannot continue in this situation i do have some cash saved and have accepted the fact that i may be out of work for a few months other option is to eat a bullet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you are rightfor my field jobs start posting in marchwith the high point about of may im going to wait for the right time ty
GetMotivated,not_removed,cool music helps mood so much good luck getting through this i hope you can find a few different ways to cope with the depression and frustration and be able to come out of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,so many people in education are going through similar situations i dont know why there seems to be a war on educators and administration is on the side of the enemy my sister went through it shes a librarian at a community college now her job is only part time but shes so much happier she cant believe how much easier her new job is
GetMotivated,not_removed,i made it almost a game and it pretty much helped me forget how i felt i was being used and abused treated unfairly and taken for granted
GetMotivated,not_removed,trying its seems there are very few these days just a widening wage gap
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,education is going in wrong direction and most of the problems are a result of everything imposed on the students and teachers by the state the students are coming in every year with more severe emotional behavioral issues teaching becomes the supplemental activity
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was totally faking it today good advise
GetMotivated,not_removed,im so glad it helped i was surprised by how much better i felt and it kind of made me forget my bitterness im still looking for a different job though hahaha
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hear yait is a good coping strategy
GetMotivated,not_removed,hi i just thought i would check in and see how you are doing this time of year is also kind of blah for me on top of the job woes hopefully the upcoming holidays will provide some welcome time off with family and a chance to regroup all the best to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you so muchthat is very kind of you to reach out im doing a little better ive decided that i should go to a counselor the funny thing is that i am a school counselor but this year is like nothing ive ever seen beforelots of heavy hearts at my school due to a new administrator who shows very little respect its hard to see so many people hurting its a new experience for me the depth of hurt ive also tried to follow some of the suggestions i got herewhich in some way has helped me feel a little more empowered to cope ive realized something about myselfthat i have to believe in and have respect for the principal i work for otherwise my work is diminished to a degree that i feel is not right for me thank you for the notemade my day
GetMotivated,not_removed,im glad youre feeling a little better its good that you realize that you need to get out of there my sister went through something very similar with a change in administration then there was a minor incident with a student that was blown way out of proportion she also blew it out of proportion from my view as an outsider looking in it was hard to believe how demoralized she became she began to think she wouldnt be able to find another job she loved the other teachers she worked with so she ended up holding on too long until she got laid off they didnt use tenure as the deciding factor in the layoffs so that upset her too that she was laid off before teachers who had not been there as long as she was anyway that was a long way to say that its good that you realize that you need to get out unfortunately things will never be the same even if the administration changes again a good counselor will help you as well

GetMotivated,not_removed,the discipline comes from the punishment and negative feedback that comes from not being prepared a typical job doesnt have these cruel and unusual punishments youre late and unprepared in the navy they can take your free time your ability to see your family your pay your freedom while you still have to show up to work every day the discipline comes from fear of punishment and cant be easily replicated otherwise
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is almost impossible to replicate the structure the sense of collective incl punishment for things you had nothing to do with and the satisfying feeling of living your life with a greater purpose the closest you can do is be rigid and dogmatic in your daily dealings and be a slave to your timetable these things are in general incompatible with sane civilian living source years in exnco now commissioned officer
GetMotivated,not_removed,doesnt sound too difficult just take care of what you have to do you dont need some guy yelling at you and telling you what to do all the time thats a poor myth of the military that theyll get your shit together you have to learn how to take your own responsibility live your own life not have someone a bunch of people use fear other tricks and yell at you on how to live your own life figure out what you want being a robot isnt necessarily better
GetMotivated,not_removed,op what you think you want is not what you want you have a very romanticized view of it the military has sich order because they do no have real free will they are property of the government they sustain mental abuse and are driven by fear into order it is a great accomplishment to go through that without cracking dont get me wrong but no one wants to go through that you can be thorough and motivated without having military level order ingrained into your brain
GetMotivated,not_removed,the clue is having someone to nag you and make sure you do everything straight away and never go empty handed etc so getting a spousepartnersergeant should do the trick but seriously it is about mindset most jobs actually require more effort if it takes time so it is better to do it straight away in addition you have the preparedness that comes with doind things fully while you are at it example time situation making dinner in the kitchen you have several ways to do this clean while cooking clean after postpone cleaning one of those uses less of your time which means you have more time to do other stuff clean while cooking always waiting time if you postpone cleaning everything will be stuck in short this means that doing it straight away will make several things happen you will feel accomplishment for doing a thing promptly and correctly you will have more spare time since it is always fastest to do things when fresh in memory not hardened etc and you will be prepared to do things straight away with your emergency gear if you waited what could have happened went for a drive and you had a need for it running late because you needed to reload it stuff missing because you waited with reloading so ask yourself when in doubt will this take more time if i do it later most of the time the answer is yes and you should just do it ps always use good judgement
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure if this is off topic but giving yourself punishments can help push yourself into performing your task better this can be with anything i know i even do it with my videogames if i lose my match i have to do pushups each match is around minutes long i usually do my pushups in the load time in between when i start i do if i win if i lose and then later dont do any when i win this helps take me out of autopilot mode during my gaming sessions by helping me focus not feeling lazy and keeps me fit
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was in the army for a year every one of my coworkers are just as lazy as i am when the boots come off i believe the army discipline thing is a myth outside of work
GetMotivated,not_removed,im in the military and i dont believe there is any special discipline or that people are any more motivated or disciplined you have to have the basic skills of being on time being prepared and not being a pos to get through basic so the military is only for being with the required discipline level but teaching adults discipline doesnt work all the military does is provide a purposeful meaningful employment with a set career with advancement interest and growth
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me personally what helped tremendously is designing and adhering to a daily routine and making desired actions automatic doing something over and over again makes it a habit
GetMotivated,not_removed,discipline can only make the body comply with the schedule when the fear of noncompliance isnt present discipline is no longer discipline the only thing left to get whatever end result was aimed for in the first place is internal desire
GetMotivated,not_removed,that only works when there is a real war on ie a not completely lopsided kill ratio and actual combat against a nationstate
GetMotivated,not_removed,this thread resonates with me to the point where i dropped everything i was doing and went through this thread the moment i saw it and your comment begs me to ask the question is there any fucking way i can make a military lifestyle compatible with civilian living i do not mind being insane ive tried everything to get to a point where i can be successful in my endeavors ive come a little far not very much but just a little ive realised that when im in a situation where there is no other option but for me to complete an objective im successful the consequences normally are negative social image fear of disappointing high achieving peers fear of failing an ideal based on which the project was founded fear of being the sole person responsible for the failure of a collective group effort which would be otherwise looked at as bold and pioneering i do not want these to be my motivators because im at heart lazy and prone to procrastination these motivators only end up in me panicking at the last moment and incurring enormous amounts of stress and depression all my personal ambitions have thus far gone unrealised due to the lack of panic this militarization is literally my last straw ive been trying to find ways of doing it recently but ive failed and today i saw this post i need help is there a way
GetMotivated,not_removed,i replied to another comment on this thread but id like to ask you the same question is it possible to self impose this harshness to generate discipline or maybe develop a system that could work
GetMotivated,not_removed,ha i guess ive seen some who didnt maintain it as well but i know many who are still pretty active and keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,there isnt really a way to replicate a military environment consider joining the reserves or national guard
GetMotivated,not_removed,the adjustment is a tough one it took me years to readjust to the civvie lifestyle my biggest problem was the rest of the workplace seemed so woefully inefficient that my co workers had no idea of how to get a job done in a timely manner perhaps they didnt even care that the job got done i had a hard time having any friends in the workplace they seemed to think i was sucking up by working so hardbut that was slower than what my usual pace would be even today after being out for years i still have issues with idle time at work i get anxious i think the difference imo is that in military life you are given hard timelines and direct issues to handle whereas in the civillian lifestyle its more free flowing the service teaches one to work under stress to thrive and do their best while in a stressful situation i think that is where i match up with your situation the lack of impending doom just i dunno doesnt feel right the downtime one would get was almost always for me lazy time i drank and partied a lot in those days it took me a lot of time to adjust i ended up setting scheduled for down time making it seems like it wasnt really down time at all actually writing down things like wake shower breakfast county park for geocaching i would schedule my entire day took me about months to start being able to be more free flowing with my free time until it became second nature again
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh damn thank you very much for your reply but i think i may not have been clear in what i was asking im a civilian who wants a military lifestyle and not the other way around basically i was asking how to do the exact opposite of what you described but then question still remains open to you thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,good point my most success in fitness was when i was doing just having that calendar to fill out and this image of tony horton looking down on me if i skipped a day or ate a doughnut was key for those days
GetMotivated,not_removed,join the military set a rigid often nonsensical schedule filled to the brim with long periods of waiting around with severe negative consequences for not following it learn to live only for your work and only hang out with your coworkers just some ideas
GetMotivated,not_removed,can i let my dreams be dreams
GetMotivated,not_removed,some people get up and work hard at it
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would be nice if you elaborated on this idea its true but it isnt very practical in this form you need to tell people the steps they can take to incorporate this idea in their life even if youre not sure how people can do this by writingtalking about it you can develop your own ideas and share some useful tips everyones a winner
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats there to elaborate on seems pretty self explanatory to me this subreddit is starting to annoy me a lot of people either whining or complaining how some post didnt magically fix everything its called get motivated not here let me solve all of your lifes problems
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i just think that part of being motivated is knowing about the strategies or approaches that can be used to complete tasks its easy to read a nice quote but its unlikely to motivate people in the long run im not saying this was a bad post its actually a really good thought just that it could be more helpful if it contained some views or advice it doesnt solve problems but gives people ideas that they can actually implement in their lives which i think is more useful than remembering a nice quote sorry if i came across as whining just trying to offer some constructive advice

GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope everyone is having a great monday i want this article to give you the drive to have a productive week and beyond it doesnt matter what you are doing all that matters is you are creating something unique to you have a powerful day
GetMotivated,not_removed,i completely agree the regret of not doing something is such a painful feeling
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am trying my best to keep my depression under my control that said i would not know the techniques to help calm myself had i not seen a therapist these guys are the fucking shit and they will give you ways to deal with your anxiety no medication for me and theyre someone to vent to that said heres what i do when i feel im about to lose control take a deep breath and close my eyes i imagine breathing in all of my stress and holding it until i feel warm in my chest i breathe out and i imagine that all of my negativity my sadness and pain is being forced out of me after a few breaths to calm myself i flip a switch in my head i imagine myself out of body and ill try to dissect my feelings what am i feeling why am i sad detachment is incredibly helpful it will help me recognize why im feeling so overwhelmed and it brings me back to reality after im back in reality and i know why im sad and why my feelings are rational i like to think of it as something that will dissipate sometimes i like to think that the hot breath i initially breathe out is a cloud that is passing over my head my feelings are there in that cloud right over me they are voluminous they are looming but you know what theyre temporary the cloud is going to move far away from you and thats a fact there may be another cloud in the future but that one is going to move too friend i am not happy or fulfilled but i keep myself from imploding by doing this
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a quality of lightness that comes with the emergence from a long depression i have experienced it a few times and writing a bit about it might help me remember perhaps it can help you too apparently im also sharing my story of overcoming depression sorry in advance this lightness i speak of is an abstraction and collapsing of a number of different phenomena i will try to describe my experience from my perspective actions flow easily and there is a sense that things are not so serious i dont have to mentally labor over every little thing because life is good why would i ruin the moment by thinking to hard look at the trees listen to the birds feel the rain and the wind and the sun do the dishes no sweat relishing the moment in all its reality it doesnt need to be perfect because i dont need to be perfect i just need to be here and now i used to spend all my time alone in my head even when surrounded by friends loved ones i couldnt really feel like i was there now that i can feel again the times when everything was grey and lifeless seem like an impossibility like they are someone elses memories somehow dropped in my head in a way they are because the change was me the sun didnt miraculously come out from behind the clouds i did i was or homeless sleeping in my car after years of living on other peoples couches and running away from myself everything in my life had been happening to me and i was just a victim of circumstance my mother had kicked me out at my longdistance father stopped calling at my high school career had been a trainwreck and i stopped going to community college halfway through the first quarter i was terrible with girls and had no self confidence at all i had just spent three years of my life literally nocturnal playing video games and smoking weed until am sleeping until i had tried and i had failed at life there was nothing i could do about it and no way to get that american dream for me if only i was good enough things would have been different so here i was a washed up loser with nowhere left to go no money no future sleeping in my car my luck had truly run out and i had no choice but to reevaluate my life my beliefs and my choices i had to take ownership of where i was and who i was there as a shift in my consciousness some long dormant fire was lit in my mind when you have nothing to lose everything becomes so clear i was now uncomfortable enough to do something about my life i looked at where i was headed and realized that i wouldnt get where i wanted to in life by being the same person i had been i made a promise to myself that i would get out of this mess that i would do what was necessary to be happy and healthy i had nothing to lose except a shitty car and a victim complex my first order of business was to get a place to sleep besides the safeway parking lot i swallowed my pride and called my mother we made a deal if i could get a job and save up money to pay rent i could have the spare bedroom but not before she saw the money that was as good as i was going to get so i agreed to the terms no free fish for me i got a shit host job and was the best at it i showed up every day with a smile and ran circles around that restaurant i knew i had to keep this job and the pain of sleeping in my car every night was all i needed to motivate me i was eager to prove myself and the managers loved me i worked hard and after a couple of months i managed to save enough to rent the room from my mom i felt accomplished in spite of the fact that i was doing a job mostly filled by high school girls that didnt matter because i was finally doing something instead of life doing something to me my mother was pleased i eventually was promoted to server and started making a decent amount from tips i moved out of my mothers house got a roommate and learned to really support myself i made new friends got a girlfriend and just did what young twenty somethings do i was happy i was confident and i was good enough for me im now going to school to be a web developer the gf and i broke up a few months back and it was messy to say the least ive felt myself slipping back into that dark pit too many times in the past year and not done enough to stop it ive started sleeping in hours late for school ive been staying up at night drinking beer and playing video games the levels of self loathing have been rising and my confidence has taken a hit this is all so familiar to me its so terrifying that i didnt want to face it i dont want to hate myself again i dont want to fail out of school for attendance when ive been doing so well with coding i dont want to feel that shame i long for that lightness to return but i know that it wont just appear on its own i have to make it so and i will through hard work and loving self care because im good enough for me i didnt plan to write all this and i apologize for going off topic i guess i needed to get this off my chest and your post really sparked my memory i hope that my story can be of some use to you op though it may feel like it some times you are not alone in your suffering
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmmmi was depressed years ago no longer am wake up tired because i never get to bed at the time i should usually have a headache bc i grind my teeth rush to get out the door and dont have time to think feel sad when i drop my kid off at school or my grandmas house since it is summer break go to work and generally feel fine sometimes irritated if the day isnt going well get off work and am happy usually have dinner take the dog on a walk and feel happy go home and take care of household chores and feel surprisingly ok about this my kids bedtime routine falls somewhere in the middle and reading her a chapter of a book is one of my favorite parts of the day then i do some more household stuff work on a project take a shower get stuff ready for the next day and then watch tv or look aty phone until im tired thats a typical weekday weekends consist of going somewhere fun one of the two days mowing grass seasons of the year grocery shopping and my feelings range from excited to meh to i fucking hate this depending on the task no idea if this was what you were looking for

GetMotivated,not_removed,this is marginal advice at best yes if someone is walking away from you let them walk but ask yourself why why does this person not want to be in my life no one is perfect and if you want to be motivated you want to be the best person you can be you owe it to yourself to take an honest compassionate look on the relationship thats ending what could you have done better to be a better person what could you have done to be better for them make that a part of your identity learn grow and improve or risk watching everyone youve ever cared about walking away from you throughout your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,can someone give a synopsis at work
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this is good i totally agree thanks for sharing

GetMotivated,not_removed,quitter
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a huge difference between smoking for three years and smoking for or more sometimes cold turkey does not work for adults whos entire lives have involved smoking i started at years old smoked until years old i could not remember a life without cigarettes every phone call every car ride every beer every morning coffee every evening tea every girlfriend every job almost literally everything i experienced was influenced by or involved cigarettes you bet your ass i used nicotine replacement to quit
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit smoking when i decided that i was going to try out to become a combat diver my cardio sucked ass at the time and i knew i had to improve or id never make it every time i had a craving id ask myself what i wanted more a cigarette or to become a diver with that goal in mind quitting was actually pretty easy ive been a combat diver for years now this coming fall
GetMotivated,not_removed,years smoker here im now months since ive smoked and i also quit cold turkey the trick for me was a dumb app on my phone that counted how long since id last smoked and showed me how many i now wasnt smoking as well as how much money i was saving once i hit like days i really didnt want to start over after a couple of weeks i felt stupid for ever smoking at all for the curious its over cigarettes and over saved by not smoking the app was called mylastcigarette but im sure there a thousand of them that do this
GetMotivated,not_removed,reformed smoker now for yrs smoked for if i could give you a bit of advice on your newly found freedom is this the only person youre going to hurt if you start back up is you and stop counting the days or time its when you stop doing this is when you have really quit otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure how do i know cause i did it too ask yourself why are you counting the days are you suddenly gonna reward yourself with a smoke once you get to months etc no so stop it trust me only count em down when people ask you how long its been or one day when you get mad about something or nervous you will have this conversation in your head its been months since i had a smoke but im really stressed out right now i can just have one if i can go months then wont hurt bullshit you have that one and your back to smoking guaranteed so please stop counting the days if you are cant tell ya how many times i did that before quiting for good
GetMotivated,not_removed,great job keep it up i smoked from and quit cold turkey definitely wasnt easy but i felt great after a couple months unfortunately i fell off the wagon in due to stress at work and home but just had my last one eight days ago same goal just want to be healthy again
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats op was a habitual smoker for years really loved the taste of tobacco switched to a vaping now i cant stand tobacco although i do enjoy my weekend weed sesh with a bit of tobacco on its own i dont have the urge to smoke once we convince ourselves that tobacco is yucky we will lose that urge my problem was i associated smoking tobacco with pleasure while i aware i havent kicked the addiction i am smoking vaping low nicotine liquids that doesnt taste as good as it should just to satisfy the addiction rather than make it a pleasurable experience weed on the other hand tho good job op
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit cold turkey on jan and have not smoked since i had smoked since
GetMotivated,not_removed,smoke weed everyday
GetMotivated,not_removed,good that you quit now be glad that you quit early in life after only three years smoking does irreparable damage to your lungs so the less time you spend smoking the healthier you will be over the long term i smoked for almost years off and on in my younger years before i quit for good once i got older and married health became much more of a priority and im so happy i quit smoking i just regret not quitting earlier in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive quit cold turkey for about months on now the turning point was when i fell completely sick with cold fever cough vomiting it used to smoke packs a day and i thought it was probably nicotine poisoning or something like that never wanting to feel so shitty again i quit and never looked back i do sometimes have the urge though i usually just drink a beer and forget about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit when i realized i had attached labels and value to each cigarette the beginning of an addiction for instance theres the first smoke of the day smoke and the mid morning break smoke and there was the this cup of tea would go great with a cigarette smoke followed by the ive been writing this paper for hours a smoke would be a good excuse for a break smoke all totally created its just a cigarette nothing more nothing less that helped me out immensely smoked off and on for about ten years now i dont even like the smell anymore good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit about a year and a half ago due to similar reasons i started running two years ago and i was struggling to push past a certain point i am glad to hear that you cant see yourself smoking again keep up the good work and congratulations you can do this and im sure you will keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was a smoker for years at the age of i quit smoking all of a sudden one day just stopped had a shit ton of fettuccine noodles to crunch through a bunch of video games to play and it was still about the worst days of my life that was so certainly keep at it im still not fit but i am healthier still working on the fit part but i was working on my career getting my gf to become my wife and etc although i am not hugely overweight just maybe pounds
GetMotivated,not_removed,i started around the same age took me about years to finally quit did it cold turkey after trying for years to cut down etc what i learned is everyone quits when its their time a friend of mine quit few months after me pretty much saying if i could do it so could he all that aside dont be the douche who criticises people for the exact thing he was doing not long ago also congratulations and keep your guard up
GetMotivated,not_removed,good for you i smoked for years the moment i found out i was pregnant i threw all of my cigarettes out i have been smoke free almost two years now still have cravings sometimes but i will never start smoke again
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit cold turkey almost weeks ago after smoking for years i think im not sure if it was the nicotine withdrawal or just my general craziness but ive been suuuper moody since then thinking of starting back up just to feel sane again
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit years ago when my dad was diagnosed with stage lung cancer nothing like knowing youre headed to a future surgery where they crack open your ribs and cut out part of your lung to help the quit happen i was scared because i knew i was addicted every time i got a craving i got on a message board and read about people quitting i did it cold turkey you are addicted to the nicotine i did not gain weight i did have more time on my hands i did feel sooooo much better after awhile strangely enough i was repulsed by the smell of cigarette smoke you can do it if you fail fuck it quit again fresh air is awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,just checked my app days for me after years of smoking keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit cold turkey a month ago too id tried many times before and never had success because i was always doing it for someone else not for me in recent years i sought treatment for my severe anxiety and depression and as a result of that realized that i do want to live a long and healthy life im so happy ive finally made it here and it feels incredible im so proud of myself and im proud of you too
GetMotivated,not_removed,reading this post while my roommate is outside at am coughing up a lung i quit smoking months ago and can already feel my lungs healing and no more being out of breathe from jogging block i havent felt coughed up anything black yet still waiting on it i am also and started smoking when i was
GetMotivated,not_removed,switched to vaping i guess you could say i quit too kinda congrats tho lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,quit chewing weeks ago cold turkey never been happier with a decision
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit in saved the money i wasnt spending on smoking and bought a dodge dakota rt short bed short cab it has cost me more than smoking after transmissions a water pumpbad design and a computer but dont let that get you down my wifes cooking is times better now that i can taste it
GetMotivated,not_removed,good luck man ive quit several times with each time being longer than two months i havent managed to crack it yet hang in there but dont be bummed out if you pick it up again most quit attempts fail
GetMotivated,not_removed,great job i did the same thing a few years ago what helped me is realizing that it was a choice between shortterm pleasure vs longterm pleasure i decided to stop seeking the shortterm gratification because i was sick and tired of being sick and tired as scott peck the road less traveled said discipline is nothing other than the ability to forgo instant gratification congrats remember that any discomfort or cravings you suffer will not last
GetMotivated,not_removed,why the fuck were you smoking cold turkey and how
GetMotivated,not_removed,sigh fucking couldnt care less is what you mean
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not strong enough alone to quit smoking but i did it twice already both times when i was trying to impress a girl
GetMotivated,not_removed,never tried smoking turkey before u hitting a pipe or rollin up
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you are going to put turkey on the smoker you should always have it be room temperature first cold turkey especially frozen will taste pretty nasty and cant be properly prepped dad jokes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i havent smoked cold turkey since last boxing day
GetMotivated,not_removed,good cause smoking cold turkey will give you cold turkey lung
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres no such thing as quitting either youre using or youve quit you might be cutting back on it but you havent quit yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i downloaded a quit smoking app just the free version was enough to pull up when i got a craving and see how much improvement my heart or lungs theoretically made or how much money i theoretically saved it was enough to keep me from starting the clock over just made it through the most anxiety inducing event of my life speaking in front of people at my best friends wedding without lighting up
GetMotivated,not_removed,heck yeah bro keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit a few days ago theres this app i like called smoke free that might help you track progress it makes quitting into a game with missions awards and tips it seems stupid but for now i like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,what helped me was just looking at people who smoke i dont want to be like them
GetMotivated,not_removed,just remember people respect someone with a strong will it shows a lot about someones capacity to do better thank you for quitting thank you for this reply i too am glad you quit cheers to better health
GetMotivated,not_removed,but i dont want to smoke this cigarettes mommy and i dont want to be mother of a quitter finish it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i smoked for over years at the end to packs i smoked they didnt sit in ashtrays they got smoked when i smoked cigars they got inhaled in fathers day to be exact i smoked my last cigarette and had my last drink cold turkey to this day i very occasionally get the urge to smoke but im done i know the seduction is the belief that i can have just one but thats fallacious one and im right back there so im done with all that
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think i would verbally attack all my loved ones and then run out to get a full pack just because i want one without these nicotine lozenges i couldnt have lasted the days i have seriously i am proud of this
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive smoked since and will turn this year i have tried the vaping dont want that either and the patches super depressed what replacement did you use
GetMotivated,not_removed,years here im now about months in was a new years thing i still think about it alotthere are those moments when you feel like you should be doing somethinghow many times in the past did i reward myself with cigarettesi went a whole weeki can have onethen one a etcfor me its knowing they had me hookedbeing a slave to the price hikes etcfor years i would only smoke at workor never buy themnever on weekendsalways a dumb excuse to keep goinga better day to quittoo much stress to quit nowleast you quit regardless of the length of time you smokedit truly is the stupidest habit ever
GetMotivated,not_removed,i will agree that cold turkey does not work for everybody however there are many factors involved not just amount of time as a smoker i started at and quit cold turkey when i was been smoke free for years now i wouldnt say its impossible to quit cold turkey if youve smoked for years that said i understand that many people have greater success with a smoking cessation aid the most important thing is for people to use the method best suited to their particular circumstances
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats on the months
GetMotivated,not_removed,the trick for me was to stop going to rstopsmoking stopped right away no regrest
GetMotivated,not_removed,dude i was in pretty much the exact situation and i have also stopped smoking months ago it feels great to be out doesnt it just goes to show even hardcore cigarette junkies can stop the nonsense cheers
GetMotivated,not_removed,nicotine replacement products try it you stabilize your mood swings you get your nicotine but youve separated the nicotine delivery from the act of smoking do this for several months then quit the nicotine products this was the only way i quit after years of heavy smoking
GetMotivated,not_removed,jesus christ youre the third person to make this comment both phrases are fine it just depends on the voice you are using one comes from sarcasm or implied i could care less but itd be fucking impossible etc one just means i couldnt care less
GetMotivated,not_removed,half pack a day on a bad day
GetMotivated,not_removed,no he meant could care less both phrases are fine it just depends on the voice you are using one comes from sarcasm or implied i could care less but itd be fucking impossible etc one just means i couldnt care less
GetMotivated,not_removed,either work fine if you have nothing to contribute then perhaps keep your comments to yourself especially when youre wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,um im pretty sure i quit according to my post so yea
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quit yesterday morning i was about to cave in thats like saying i just started remedial math yesterday and i almost quit today because its hard but i saw this and now i know i can get a bachelors in computer science im a smoker she is at the very beginning of a facing a labyrinth of extremely difficult challenges after every meal after sex when she drinks every cup of coffee every poop etc
GetMotivated,not_removed,so im supper jelly of your name lmfao 🍄✌️ but right it sucks cuz i work in a shop and i have a lot of stress at work and it makes me crave but your right we dont wanna turn out like that
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yea heres a whole carton of cigarettes
GetMotivated,not_removed,its inspiring to read success stories like this one
GetMotivated,not_removed,i smoked that about sums up my existence during those years i wouldnt wait until after a meal to smoke i would smoke while eating i would smoke in bed while getting dressed while putting out my last oneit was almost comical looking back on it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the most important part was really being ready to quit and not quitting for anyone else i actually didnt even tell people i was quitting i just did it believe it or not on prior attempts when peoplesos would say youre doing so well im so happy youre not smoking it would trigger an intense desire to smoke you may not believe that this is a good solution but i used camel snus to quit ive tried the gum and patches before but couldnt get on board with them the snus is far healthier than chewing tobacco or even bandits pouches and is very discreet you dont spit and theyre quite small i started with small pouches and had very little side effects right off the bat sometimes hiccups too much saliva or upset stomach why snus i think it worked for two reasons both equally important it took care of the crippling and overwhelming nicotine urges and allowed me to change my habits considerably i never leave work to smoke i no longer associate phone calls with going outside to smoke i dont light up after starting the car but i still get my nicotine separating the delivery of the nicotine from the act of smoking is a huge component the second is that i still have an immature side and i liked that i was still able to enjoy tobacco on my own terms i was still a tobacco use i didnt feel like i was missing out on anything and it made removing cigarettes from my life so much easier tobacco was still there for me its ok cigarettes are old news but here we can keep enjoying our freedom ironic i know to use tobacco whenever we want also i quit drinking for six months to prevent any relapses it was that important to me i sold my heavily smoked in car and bought another car that didnt smell like cancer i picked up all cigarette butts on my property i threw away all lighters and i started riding my bicycle i rode everywhere for a while and rather than gaining weight i dropped pounds between the exercise and the no booze now i can drink and not smoke and found easing away from snus to be fifty times easier than quitting smoking i still pop a snus every once in a great while and suffer no ill effects that i can tell smoking takes over your life and if you started as young as we did it defines your life before you can even make those decisions on your own you and i never had an adult life without being addicted to cigarettes i promise you it is fucking glorious to not smoke after years of chugging cigs like the ship was going down
GetMotivated,not_removed,are mood swings a normal thing to experience after stopping nicotine i feel like its just because i have other problems
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i wasnt referring to you specifically i just meant in general
GetMotivated,not_removed,the first hours are the worst its more like saying im climbing a mountain and got to the top of the first hill and thought about quitting
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are totally right but that doesnt mean she cant do it i tried to quit a million times before i finally got it right gotta start somewhere right
GetMotivated,not_removed,true it is about will power know of people who quit for years and started again i started smoking at am somtimes i lose all hope and tell my self i am definitely going to die of cancer with a glimmer of hope in the back of my mind which in retrospect i believe is a delusional lie i tell myself regardless i need to form my resolve which has been a life long struggle in many aspects of my life thats why i have respect for all who quit and keep trying to quit it is a struggle hoping the best for all 😉😉😉
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you smoke duringafter every poop or is it the act of pooping which becomes more difficult
GetMotivated,not_removed,didnt hank hill do that to bobby
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had planned on substituting my cigarette smoking for snus for several reasons better lung capacity less or no coughing no smelling like smoke all the time and no being cold outside in the winter only downfall was that to get snus into australia was very expensive tax ended up being on top of my order in aud i ended up just forgetting about it and letting them keep it because i couldnt justify it
GetMotivated,not_removed,totally normal they can be extreme and magnified by other issues you may have
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes he did
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol no peter griffen to chris would find the link but im playing golf right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,did you eventually quit do you want me to mail you a care package
GetMotivated,not_removed,that makes me feel much better thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,im still smoking planning on not buying another pouch probably got a few days left on this one and customs will still fuck me but i appreciate the offer
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had a quick temper for a while as well and the sudden bursts of anger were a perfect time to say fuck it and march outside to gun a smoke its your brain fooling you into giving uphaving a cheater smoke
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was thinking of this specifically
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i lost my leg to cancer it seemed like everyone was telling me what i was going to be able to do anymore so i decided to focus on what i was going to do that lead me to martial arts which lead me to tokyo do ever let anyone tell who you are and what you can or cant do this life is you dream and your reality do what you do and do it at the best of your ability ive got more motivational pics and intense martial arts training videos featuring me and my son on instagram muzutomethod heres the link httpswwwinstagramcommuzutomethod stay strong
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me fairness is real but only to the extent that it deals with human affairs life is not fair but we as humans understand that we are all the same and thus the understanding of equality we have rules when we play games thats what makes the game fun fairness and when someone is considered a cheater at games its something a man might never live down but we dont apply that to the rest of man made institutions which makes life no fun for a lot of people there is truth to the phrase life is not fair its not there is illness accidents mistakes all sorts of ways life itself can really fuck you things we have no control over but the things we have control over we should play fair its how we make being people awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me this feels like a ripoff of harsh truths that came out in cracked magazine awhile back google it and see
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a parent of teenagers i think about this a lot what is the best balance of encouragement and reality i want my kids to have pride and self worth but i also know the world only cares and rewards you for what you can do for other people whining and crying about how unfair it is does not change a damn thing at the same time if you over sell the message that life is brutal you can kill their desire to try because it will seem pointless i have friends that are the types of parents that over protect and coddle their kids all the way through high school they feel that they will learn the hard lessons on their own i feel this is very selfish on their part they want home to be as happy and nonconfrontational as possible and as a result their kids are set up for a difficult adjustment to adulthood my friends tease that they are going to send their kids to my house to be disciplined because my kids have minutes of chores a week and there are consequences for bad grades less then c and bad behavior im just trying to gently prepare them for a world that will want them to achieve something before they get rewarded
GetMotivated,not_removed,says the guygal not born into a poverty stricken village in africa you can be born the son of a billionaire who also has a good heart and loves you and grow in a positive environment with a brilliant mind and looks the world is your oyster you could have instead been born into a single mother who dies giving birth and are raised to be a sex slave in a brothel until you die at getting beaten by a customer or you could be born middle of the pack average family wealth average family support average accidents and injuries average intelligence average looks or you can be a mix of all three born into rich but abusive parents but be of average intelligence the point is the world isnt fair even if you discount random disasters and it seems people who claim it is are usually above average intelligence looks and wealth that being said almost anyone can do better if they work on it doesnt make it fair i cant become prime minister because i work hard because i dont have the right parents or connections or height or gender but if i was a janitor i could work hard and become a cleaning team leader and if i was a cleaning team leader i could work harder and become something better and so on at some point working harder wont be worth the gain ill have reached my optimum work to result ratio some people have to work less to get more be it because they are brilliant or because their daddy owns the company either way you cant will or work yourself that life but you can improve your own thats what should motivate you you can do better even though life isnt handing you any good fruit you can still make lemonade and if you try harder than the guy with apples maybe youll even break even
GetMotivated,not_removed,life isnt a meritocracy either though you arent always rewarded for your ability there are countless van goghs out there you can be great at something and be unlucky or just not have access to the resources or other skills that would have lead you to success think of all the socially inept science nerds being a famous musician doesnt mean your song was better and making the better song is the ability in question there stop arguing that life is fair by some other more legitimate definition it isnt it doesnt care risk exists misfortune exist dumb luck exists idiots can succeed geniuses can fail
GetMotivated,not_removed,so another count on the this was the exact opposite of motivating i am fully aware that life is unfair and i need to be more or less awful by my own definition to really get anything and even if i am awful i still will not be able to fulfill most of my goalswhich by the way arent date a supermodel type goals as much as get out of debt type of goals i dont need a crappy article to remind me of this
GetMotivated,not_removed,its hard to not be cynical once you start to see that bullying and nepotism are successful strategies that often work longterm
GetMotivated,not_removed,life just exists its neither good or bad it just exists
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is actually a terrible article for motivation and selfimprovement read the first comment at the bottom of the article it sums things up nicely
GetMotivated,not_removed,this article is way superficial it basically assumes the goal of life is acquiring money andor fame so maybe you dont make a lot of money or dont ever become famous that doesnt mean your life necessarily is awful plenty of people manage to have happy fulfilling lives without ever achieving fame or greatness what you should really be pursuing is whatever brings you the most happiness so you write a great song and it doesnt become famous does that mean its pointless not at all maybe you find satisfaction in the process of creation doing something you enjoy or even just the knowledge that you wrote a song you like even if no one else ever hears it your goals should be intrinsic personal growth selfacceptance etc not extrinsic wealth fame etc
GetMotivated,not_removed,this article did the opposite of motivating me
GetMotivated,not_removed,the fact that i can do anything what i want easily meanwhile some poor kid cant even get food on daily basis should be enough to prove that life is unfair the article only fits for those that life in rich countries
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair isnt real nothing is fair the more you become preoccupied with the concept the more unhappy you will be
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not about fairness all the time its context sensitive injustices that get me like a familyowned business giving a break to an employee who was arrested committing a felony on the clock because he is a family friend or making your son the vp after he gets a dui totaling the company car then turning around and firing your manager because he told you to consider other options for how to spend our surplus budget fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,life no its not fair but thats what society is here for the problem with falsereasoning like this is that it fails to acknowledge that this biologically innate desire to compete is ultimately what holds us back im of the mindset that people working towards a specific goal will accomplish more than people simply out to make a name for themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,i come to rgetmotivated just to get angry at superficial quotespictures that are supposed to be inspirational
GetMotivated,not_removed,not only does this make sense its also very depressing
GetMotivated,not_removed,its refreshing and depressing to read this many of these statements are things its taken me most of my to get over and accept social relevance is playing games with our mental and emotional health on the flip side this article does not hold much water if you are able to find happiness in the work that you do and in your personal creative pursuits rather than in the rewards they bring you if you are content to walk the path without always aiming for the goal if you can disconnect from society and culture just long enough to catch a glimpse of how little our lives and ambitions matter in the grand scale of time
GetMotivated,not_removed,for anyone not really feeling this article do some research on the author aside from his cringy about me page on his website he doesnt really show any argumentative prowess in the comment section of his writings the good thing and that one actually is fair if you put thought into something you can get closer to truth sometimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairness is a fallacy we teach children in order to trick them into becoming civilized human beings
GetMotivated,not_removed,this almost makes sense but is out of whack because of the way humans value things the author mentions the difference between the amount of help and and amount of people helped but often thankless jobs help millions of lives a great deal and go popularized stock brokers provide little to no or maybe even a negative effect on the world as a whole but regardless they are paid wella once established often with little risk the many scientists that made important essential steps toward the cure for cancer will receive no wealth or fame we a conditioned by market forces to value the price of all movies video games theatre shows concerts at about the same price as things of a similar type as oppose to pricing their cost by their value to us also nepotism or just being more memorable or recognizable for some reason can lead to fame and thus wealth for reasons divorced from skill or hard work in famebased industries so life is unfair the incentives dont give us a onetoone value equals reward world but yeah the stuff not having a selfish perspective makes sense just doesnt account for a hugely more complicated world that leads to definite unfairness
GetMotivated,not_removed,wellmeaning intentions dont matter an internal sense of honour and love and duty count for squat cant say i wholly agree with this
GetMotivated,not_removed,while some of the things said in the article are good i feel that its directed at a certain type of person the stereotypical young millennial with narcissistic tendencies and extreme low selfesteem in that sense i can see it as good advice a lot of people out there of every age and type seem to have this ever present depression because the world and all of existence does not bow down to how special of a snow flake they are that being said what many people have mentioned here is true many of these thoughts sound like justifications for people to be shifty and corrupt life is not fair it a competition so is love so is business so that means its ok to have false advertisements because the bottom line is i sell my product not that it works its ok to lie to my date because someone with a better lie will come along and bag her the fact that it justify someone like kim kardashian being famous simple because they have the amazing ability to get nude in front of millions kind of kills the whole thing for me we as people should understand that life is not fair in the sense of bad luck and forces of nature but that we the majority can decide what fair means to us as a group we can rise up and make the things that are not fair today fair tomorrow to me thats much more motivational
GetMotivated,not_removed,a professor once told me fair isnt when everyone gets the same thing fair is when everyone gets what they need i dont think thats a broken expectation optimistic maybe but not broken especially as it relates to accessibilityhuman rights
GetMotivated,not_removed,i work as a principal in a high school i often talk to kids and parents about what is fair and what isnt regardless of the situation i end up talking about the idea of equality and fairness we are all born unequally whether its finances or loving parents or whatever we all enter the world into different circumstances what makes life livable is the idea that we all play the game of life fairly ie if i dont cheat on a test and someone else does they will get caught and get a lower grade because its not fair to cheat my job is designed to keep things fair for students and parents as others have pointed out ppl have become better and more sophisticated at making things unfair such is life for the most part however everyone likes the game to be fair we try to navigate the game with the same rules but we always need to remember that the game will forever be unequal so get over it and try to compete for the things you want without making the game unfair for others tldr to strive for absolute equality is pointless instead life is better if we try to make things fair during the competition
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,awful perspective of life human life is unfair because humans make it unfair human life is only relevant in the world because humans exist for most of our history we were dependant on the world dictating our quality of life this is no longer true humans have the ability to create in incredibly high standard of living for every single billion on the planet sources google up if i could find the info so can you if you care do you know what makes life unfair human choices i will never understand how so many humans go through their entire existence without ever considering so many things outside of the humans institutions of thought that have been implemented
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairness is a completely subjective idea what seems fair or just in a given situation will depend considerably on a persons perspective so if you say that life is unfair you may be right at least from your own perspective and if you say that it is fair you may also be right at least from your own perspective so arguing about whether the world is fair or unfair doesnt seem likely to be fruitful because people are unlikely to agree completely about what is fair or unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is fair because i said so now heres some reasons why life sucks this article in a nutshell
GetMotivated,not_removed,smarmy grandma talk better left for facebook life isnt fair and blogspam doesnt pass for wisdom
GetMotivated,not_removed,well now im depressed thanks front page
GetMotivated,not_removed,i believe it is the people who accept the unfairness of life in the ways listed are the sole reason they exist life doesnt have to be a competition we could work together to attempt to achieve the best possible product humanity could produce to the benefit of every single human but the people at the top choose not to because they find it easier to play the system than attempt to improve it i am not saying the article is wrong but i am saying every person who subscribes to the thought process is one more cynical asshole holding back the human race because they care infinitely more about personal status than the status of the species
GetMotivated,not_removed,all those starving kids just need to redefine the word fair brilliant
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was fascinated by the article until i reached what it was really about rule our idea of fairness is self interest from that point on is just a very low effortly masked cry for unfairness or it is just addressed to very childish people similarly we love to hate our bosses and parents and politicians their judgements are unfair and stupid because they dont agree with me and they should because i am unquestionably the greatest authority on everything ever in the whole world i mean seriously this passage then but reality is indifferent you studied hard but you failed the exam you worked hard but you didnt get promoted you love her but she wont return your calls mix up things that actually are related to fairness with things that dont really a terrible article
GetMotivated,not_removed,tbh this is bullshit right wing propaganda everything is a competition is pure ideology
GetMotivated,not_removed,so this is why psychologists call it the justworld fallacy
GetMotivated,not_removed,dude no fuck competition
GetMotivated,not_removed,its funny that the first item uses societal evaluation which can be changed to justify something intrinsic about existence
GetMotivated,not_removed,i liked the article a lot but then theres this near the end can you imagine how insane life would be if it actually was fair to everyone noone could fancy anyone who wasnt the love of their life for fear of breaking a heart companies would only fail if everyone who worked for them was evil relationships would only end when both partners died simultaneously raindrops would only fall on bad people why would you end a perfectly wellwritten article on such a hyperbole what a shame
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think the biggest thing that is truly unfair is genetics having some underlying disease puts you at a huge disadvantage similarly being unattractive is also unfair because it makes it harder to succeed without you doing anything
GetMotivated,not_removed,why is it the point of the article is missed by everyone here its asserting that life isnt governed by fairness as much as we would like it to instead people are getting into discussions about fairness unfairness how to make things fair whats fair etc people are arguing the exact point this article is trying to steer you away from
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like this piece but think its incomplete the gist is to recognize how the world is and adjust your thought processes and behaviors to better navigate it the missing component—to my mind—is that how we think the world ought to be is equally important it just comes sequentially after how it actually works in terms of acting on it if we never strove to alter our environment to our benefit wed still be hunting and gathering as nomads instead of domesticating animals and developing agriculture—hell wed still be painting our walls with lead my point is that simply saying thats the way the world is robs humanity of its potential for improvement
GetMotivated,not_removed,agree but disagree at the same time some people are just naturally disadvantaged and its not fair others have everything handed to them simply because they won the life lottery explain the fairness in having a rare disease and then having some mogul buy the patent for the drug youve been taking and you find that the price of the drug has now been increased by explain the fairness in people being born with diseases that cause them to never lead a normal life or never live long enough to have a doubledigit age this idea that youre owed things however agree thats warped
GetMotivated,not_removed,this entire infographic is just a long winded way to say life is unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,natural disasters apart people themselves are quite boring with respect to the signs you have to show in terms of your suffering otherwise the person who contributes twice as much but leaves on time gets seen as the idiot output and capability arent linear so we play a pretend game of self censorship to try to imitate the cues we think our potential benefactors expect
GetMotivated,not_removed,sooo to sum it up celebrate the status quo and everytime you want to make the world actually fairer you are going to fail thats just grim its reality thats right but arent humans known for changing reality and just because it is like it is described in the text now does it mean it is like that forever should it be like that forever as i read the text the author thinks yes but maybe im wrong there
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think life cant be fair or unfair fairness is not a measurable characteristic of life life just is if my volleyball was all midgets and your volleyball team was a team of lebron clones that is unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,everythings a competition my ass sure i may compete with a number of applicants for a job but after i get the job i may be perfectly satisfied just turning up for work and then do zero overtime ive opted out of the competition thank you very much and whats this thing about competing for a partner you cant win a person youre either drawn to a person or youre not its practically a preset
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is just too inconsistent to be categorised as fair or unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,the blessing of modern civilisation and im done reading
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is such straw man arguing number might be accurate but the others are just flat out wrong knee jerk journalism and lazy
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairness is all personal perspective then the author goes onto define his idea of fairness the one with the most toys wins assuming thats the same goal for everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive always said lifes not fair but it could be if we worked together
GetMotivated,not_removed,what did i just read life isnt fair or unfair it just is i dont have a broken idea of fairness for example what happens when someone develops a medical condition through no fault of their own that eventually bankrupts them im sure all those kids with cancer are just entitled self interested complainers good luck telling that to their parents what a load of bullshit
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont expect something good to fall out of the sky but if something does then act like haha screw you guys i got something i didnt even work hard for
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you wanna get all philosophical about it fairness is just a meaningless human construct that never has and never will actually exist in our world ¯ツ¯
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is not fair is the most invaluable lesson and ironically the single worst lesson anyone teaches growing up you hear it when your teacher or parent is too lazy to give equal reward to equal work i wish my parents had taught me the true meaning of the lesson life is not fair or just do not waste your emotions trying to be far or just work for what you want if you see someone has left their wallet on the ground in a fair world it would be returned in this world you would be wise to take the cash out and send it to lost and found
GetMotivated,not_removed,if life was fair i would have a burger right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me fairness is real but only to the extent that it deals with human affairs life is not fair but we as humans understand that we are all the same and thus the understanding of equality we have rules when we play games thats what makes the game fun fairness and when someone is considered a cheater at games its something a man might never live down but we dont apply that to the rest of man made institutions which makes life no fun for a lot of people there is truth to the phrase life is not fair its not there is illness accidents mistakes all sorts of ways life itself can really fuck you things we have no control over but the things we have control over we should play fair its how we make being people awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,rule you will spend your entire life being exploited and dominated by people born with advantages you can only dream of ftfy
GetMotivated,not_removed,rule our idea of fairness is self interest its true there are some truly awful authority figures but theyre not all evil selfserving monsters trying to line their own pockets and savour your misery im confused now
GetMotivated,not_removed,the system in which we exist is not fair just because something is unfair doesnt mean that it cant happen if you want to get ahead in the system you have to figure out its rules and play well by them we can still recognize that the current system is not as good as things could be and that we should endeavour to collectively improve it which means among other things making it fairer
GetMotivated,not_removed,the only motivation i ever get from these laying down the truth no filter articles is motivation to send the author a middle finger many aspects of life have competition yes but people who look at life as one big competition are sociopaths these people are not what a healthy society needs if you want something you should work for it but theres no getting motivated to want it the motivation should be intrinsic
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a short accurate and frontside worthy text
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is just plain wrong and i did go read the article but the wrongness starts right there in the title no my idea of what constitutes fairness is not broken neither is yours the concepts of fair play and fair division are wired right into our brains and not just oursmonkeys and dogs and crows all have the same responses to fairness and unfairness that we do the word fair means that emotion the thing inside us that makes us happier when everybody in the room gets one piece of candy and then pissed off when that one bastard got extra author doesnt get to redefine that to suit his own purposes next the author tries to mess further with your perception of fairness by blurring the lines between admiration and cash no people do not admire supermodels more than they do cancer researchers or stockbrokers more than janitors nobody ever did occupy bathroom except maybe after too many burritos then he gets into something thats almost true but still twisted there are quite a few people who use the word unfair when what they really mean is i didnt get what i wanted those people are misusing the word no question the thing is most of us grow out of it by the time we move out of moms basement finally and this spot in an essay is important its where you slide in the knife he has these three paragraphs similarly we love to hate our bosses and parents and politicians their judgements are unfair and stupid because they dont agree with me and they should because i am unquestionably the greatest authority on everything ever in the whole world its true there are some truly awful authority figures but theyre not all evil selfserving monsters trying to line their own pockets and savour your misery most are just trying to do their best under different circumstances to your own maybe they know things you dont – like say your company will go bust if they dont do something unpopular maybe they have different priorities to you – like say long term growth over short term happiness ah the masters are not unfair and do not do unfair things and they know better than you yeah no it would be possible to write a worthwhile essay on the kinds of confusion shown here it is good to know that there are different kinds of rewards and that the ones you get from other people happen at their discretion not yours ops essay is not that worthwhile essay
GetMotivated,not_removed,no this may be factually true as we can see it from our windows and in some cases our ivory towers fairness in many respects is like responsibility for actions or agency yes the old question of free will and determinism brought to life the heart of that conflict in the modern sense is that determinism is very real we have precursor electrical impulses before we do things and naturenurture takes care of the rest however going around saying life doesnt matter means that life doesnt matter very much and people that believe that usually achieve less in life and are less apt to make good moral choices in the field such as showing up to work on time or putting in the effort to find your soulmate we must both understand the limitations of fairness but practice and preach it as both a virtue and the path to a better future espousing unfairness as the justification and posing the question what are you going to do about it or some variant is fine for decisive action planning eg having your hand caught under a rock but for long term and large groups we must use better constructs like fairness to try to form an autonomous form of help and insurance a good example of this is driving in germany most drivers are careful polite and less reckless than the rest of the world because they believe more fully in each other and the fairness of the conduct if you go out in the streets of italy you know people will be doing in kph lanes and cutting you off so you must preemptively follow similar methods to be safer
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i didnt come here to hear you dont get what you deserve and working hard and staying focused doesnt mean you will get anything for your effort successful people are willing to step on heads and hearts because social darwinism definitely has a place in the modern world i dont give a shit if the world is supposedly one way said to be that way because it sounds like tough love or whatever this is and it wants you to conform to it to find success being a opportunistic monster with a nice car or whatever is a hollow victory take that world and shape it like fucking clay because it is yours to change to conquer their insane description of an actually fair life is not that bad people should love who they love do what they love and be true to themselves that is the only flavor of success worth tasting go be a stock broker or hedge fund manager or some shit if you just want the frills of success and no emotional content in your life patrick bateman style
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is only a competition until enough of us decide to not compete with each other anymore i hope i live to see that day
GetMotivated,not_removed,its true there are some truly awful authority figures but theyre not all evil selfserving monsters trying to line their own pockets and savour your misery except both of the fuckers running for president
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think people focus on fairness as an outcome when i believe fairness is measured at the start if everyone starts with equal resources it can be considered fair but complaining that your outcomes are different isnt a factor of fairness but a combination of everything thats happened from start to finish think of a simple board game everyone starts at start with the same resources this is fair this doesnt mean the end game will have everyone winning fairly because the game happens luck strategy etc if this is the case then no life is not fair people start out in a multitude of situations and then either do something with what theyre given or they dont
GetMotivated,not_removed,mentioning fair or deserving is the quickest way to be dismissed as a goof of the time deserve only applies to what you already have
GetMotivated,not_removed,if we all complied by the same rules of fairness then life would not flourish or prosper
GetMotivated,not_removed,live idealistically with a pragmatic view of the world
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair is where you take the kids to see the ponies life is not fair my pops used to say tough titty said the kitty but the milk has run dry so i use that every time i want to feel down about getting the short end
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup could i distill a few of these these are some of the rules that i live be above all be useful this could mean competent timely proactive or more likely a combination of the three dont take failure personally understand and accept that some people have power over you bosses clients etc and understand that this means you should do your damnedest to try and make them happy however i disagree with his thinlyveiled implication that we should all abandon our ideals in pursuit of these goals he doesnt talk enough about the point where you should stick to your ideals people daring to make what they felt was a good thing rather than what at the time was understood to be a popular thing is the only way weve experienced innovation in this world ditto for disagreeing with management his assertion that bosses etc are a class of people who are genuinely good folks is particularly weak one cannot say that self interest is not the primary motivator for managers in the same article that says that the way to succeed is to compete and be self interested are not managers an example of success within a certain industry therefore they must also be extremely self interested and should not be trusted
GetMotivated,not_removed,the author never clearly articulates what our idea of fairness really is but i think he is the closest to showing us when he says raindrops would only fall on bad people hes basically saying our idea of fairness is that bad things shouldnt happen to good peopleme and if i dont like it then its not fair this is clearly nonsense to anyone who has lived in the real world most people would agree a good person could make a bad business decision and lose their company as a fair consequence but in the second to last paragraph he claims that in a fair world only evil people could lose their businesses capitalism is a pretty fair system because everyone follows the same rules produce something that is in demand to make money and it works pretty well as long as multiple individuals are allowed to meet the demands of the people consider a hypothetical where a drug company has the exclusive right to sell a pill that cures hiv lets say for simplicity that the pill only costs to make and only people have hiv the company could pay for its research and make a profit if the pill sold at each they could sell it to everyone and make total and lives would be saved they could also sell the pills for million each but only the richest person with hiv could afford it the profit would be but people would die does this seem fair to you of course not this example isnt true capitalism because the law grants monopoly but it is a representation of our world tldr the world is made unfair by institutions not the people around you
GetMotivated,not_removed,im more impressed by that guy getting the potato to grow that big than his sculpture skills
GetMotivated,not_removed,always feels good to have someone else almost validate my feelings imo fair is a completely meaningless measure since there are billion different definitions of what it means is fair who cares the question is what are you going to do about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,too late to get any notice but ive been thinking about fairness and justice a lot lately i also have teenagers in my life so it comes up quite a bit what should the year old get versus the year old versus the year old does everybody get the same number of chores does the older one do more because they are older what if they are working what if one is babysitting what if the parent works hours does that mean that they get the night off of making dinner and cleaning there is fairness same to everyone and there is justice which i dont have as pithy a statement of maybe getting what is needed giving what is required so i do know that i stop and get myself an ice cream on the way home from work as my budget and waistline allows and there is no need for me to feel guilty about others not getting ice cream they also have resources and could use them that way if they desired
GetMotivated,not_removed,already nailed this bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,except life isnt fair objectively so
GetMotivated,not_removed,and yet i still believe life to be fair
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair is a dirty word in our house there is no fair there is wrong unjust unbalanced discrimination
GetMotivated,not_removed,some fair points
GetMotivated,not_removed,you get what you need and people need to accept that
GetMotivated,not_removed,to get what you want you have to deserve what you want the world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a bunch of undeserving people correct me if im wrong that quote is from charlie munger
GetMotivated,not_removed,most of us get so hung up on how we think the world should work that we cant see how it does but facing that reality might just be the key to unlocking your understanding of the world and with it all of your potential this is just plain wrong and naive how the world works does not explain anything how the world works needs to be explained society is not some godgiven entity society is a function of so many things that are within our control
GetMotivated,not_removed,if anything its both
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is deep
GetMotivated,not_removed,i always thought that saying just meant you dont always get what you want even if you think you really deserve it
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldr dont whine it doesnt change anything with a mix of actually do things good advice lots of people seem to think theyre more important than they are but in fairness to the guy who never published his book he might be only a tiny step away from stardom hes legitimately interesting
GetMotivated,not_removed,mind blown
GetMotivated,not_removed,i tell my kids age and that life is not fair all the time im totally serious too i dont think it is sinking in with them because they really want to believe that it is fair according to their interpretation of fair but it really isnt like it really really really isnt you might think you can just do your homework and get good grades and youll automatically go to college and get a job that you like but it doesnt work like that you might think that your parents will live until youre middle aged so you can have a long happy life with them but it might not work like that either you might think that you and your siblings will be loved by your parents equally and that youll each do equally well in life nope you may think that you will never get a serious illness and wont get disabled or dead or get a terrible skin condition whelp that might happen too i lived in the happy bubble that my kids were in for a long time until some of these things happened and i realized there is no bubble its probably a good idea to realize this sooner vs later but nobody wants to do that
GetMotivated,not_removed,man wish i had a link to that monkey getting pissed when he wasnt fairly rewarded fairness is real
GetMotivated,not_removed,that makes sense right up until the bro that whole swole as fuck zero chance that guy wants to be small
GetMotivated,not_removed,did his blog died or something it seem to have stopped on dec
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive sent her pictures of my junk why wont she love meeee ive been there friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,no life is still very unfair and its a problem
GetMotivated,not_removed,yo people dont give trans people a fair shake as much as they do cis people thats unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont understand this idea of fairness is it fair that warren buffet is worth more money that i might make in my life time is it fair that while i was born in a middle class family others were born to the top of americas class system is it fair that loosing little league teams get the same trophy as the winning ones life is not fair period you can look at the scientific theories of evolution and natural selection to understand that lifes not fair but thats the beauty of it if we had the same opportunities and experiences as everyone else then there would be no innovation and achievement hell what i think is fair is having the wisdom to realize that lifes unfair being able to spot out when your friends might screw you over and develop ways to handle the situation if it comes up is the wisdom of fairness ill leave you with this thought human beings and the societies that we create are dynamic your best friends one day might turn out to be your worst enemies down the road your business partner might screw you over when he sees an opportunity to take some money and run life isnt fair but one of the greatest aspects of human nature is that we have the mental faculties to deal will the dynamic nature of life the biggest problem is that a lot of us forget that we have this ability dont forget but use it
GetMotivated,not_removed,the way i heard it is life isnt fair or unfair life just is
GetMotivated,not_removed,all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree look at seth rogan you can tell he is the nicest guy ever yes he is good at what he does but he didnt cheat and he is not being cut throat being a good person is still something we should strive to do also be great at what you do being great at what you do doesnt always mean competing with others in a way that brings others down
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck that i refuse to accept lifes rules the fact that lifes rules arent i can do whatever i want and be happy all the time is why i want to die
GetMotivated,not_removed,raindrops would only fall on bad people i love this
GetMotivated,not_removed,nah the problem is that life is unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was a great read i thoroughly enjoyed it
GetMotivated,not_removed,my ancestors never worked in corporate america they were farmers and before that hunters and before that time travelers and before that me again at least thats how the legend goes the point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead they just had to worry about how they put food on the table and not alter the past
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is unfair but this article is sucking too much of its own ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,heres an article constructed on grounds of capitalism being key to survival of western values where companies need people to fight as hard as possible for the little money they are willing to spend upon you the hard workers there are better ways to live and just because life shits on you because other people believe they will profit from beating you or triumphing the capitalist world is small compared to the rest of the world the rest of the world wants peace and a healthy diet for all the people in it dont believe these excuses for economic growth people are wasting your quality of life so they can have a higher standard of living and they make these absolving philosophical statement to justify the social crime they commit to award themselves success there is a bright future if we can eliminate the people that want us to fight to succeed at our colleagues failure we can work together and make a future for everyone or we can accept that half of us will succeed and the other half will not and then china will buy the us because only half the people will care
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey this isnt what bernie said
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is fair if you are morally bankrupt
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a load read the first line were all in competition although we prefer not to realise it most achievements are only notable relative to others you swam more miles or can dance better or got more facebook likes than the average well done so this author values facebook likes the same as athleticism or talent what a terrible article guess what we made it thus far as humans as a team
GetMotivated,not_removed,the way him think is like someone have to aprove what i do for others so i will receive my reward based on this feelings with what others give to me so rewards are what people think not only money but if all my rewards remain on what people think about me i will never be rewarded because is not what i do it is what people want i do if someone try to do what they really want since it is not illegal or self destructive what matter if people will not stare at me if i am really happy with i do so this article is more like how do you do to make your professional career more brilliant and for much people this dont bring rewards and happiness so this article is more like how do you do to make your professional career more brilliant and for much people this dont brings rewards and happines
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre right the game isnt fair by our standards because those standards dont fit the rules of the game but rules can be changed
GetMotivated,not_removed,life isnt meant to be fair but you are in control of your own actions you cant change the cards you were dealt but you can choose how to play them people who keep score of what they give vs what theyre given will never lead a satisfied life
GetMotivated,not_removed,the issue with this is that we live in an age where cheaters are becoming either increasingly hard to spot or are so insulated from punishment that it doesnt matter either way to assume humanity is going to play fair with you is optimistic but folly there are plenty of people who value themselves more than the human condition that having been said you dont need to walk around sweeping peoples feet out from under them in the name of the competitive spirit just make sure that youre fully prepared for someone to do it to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,not being content with unfairness isnt the same as presupposing that everything is fair already also most of the people who cheat or game the system use this exact justification ie that if they didnt cheat someone else would have except that if they hadnt then the number of cheaters in the world would have been reduced by at least one
GetMotivated,not_removed,too bad people would willing fuck over others for their own benefit and take no responsibility over it we can make it fair but we choose not to source was fucked over by people
GetMotivated,not_removed,this comic was catastrophically wrong in a multitude of places to the detriment of the reader i hope people arent taking this callous cynicism seriously
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is stupid it doesnt make any argument for instance its first tenant is life is a competition but then it doesnt argue why that claim is true it just states it as a fact every logician is rolling in their graves
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair getting what you want fair is equal reaction to specific action if i walk into a room and punch everyone but one person in the face its unfair however if i punch everyone its fair immoral wrong rude and likely to get me hit as well yes but despite being wrongimmoral its fair because it happened to everyone equally i work hard im not a billionaire zuck works hard and he is not fair dunno since we both work hard at different things in different times in different zones of influence so our actions arent identical nor are our results life however is fair we are all fucked in one way or another
GetMotivated,not_removed,well written
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is only tangentially related but there are some pretty
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have said this for years but in other words if you are disappointed in anything it is because your expectations were unrealistic what happened was reality if it didnt measure up your expectations were too high
GetMotivated,not_removed,lost my dad to a heart attack at found his bloody corpse on the ground and gave him cpr tasted blood for years after my fiancees drugged out father murdered her mother and brother in front of her when she was she lost her whole adoptive family here in america to cancer when she was life is not fair it isnt supposed to be thats why having a good sense of humor is both necessary a sign of strength shit sucks sometimes laugh it off and deal with it as leonidas said incoming enemy arrows block out the sun from time to time then we shall fight in the shade
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairness is an abstract if youre expecting life to be fair you should probably search elsewhere death for example is pretty evenhanded i know tons of dead people and theyre pretty much all in the same situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairness isnt real you dumb bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,its true there are some truly awful authority figures but theyre not all evil selfserving monsters trying to line their own pockets and savour your misery isnt that everyone though
GetMotivated,not_removed,was this shit written by a year old who just finished atlas shrugged it has to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,the blatantly obvious response to this article is of course some things in life are fair and of course some things in life are unfair when we agree to flip a coin for who gets the last pizza or split it evenly thats fair when a child is born into crippling poverty while another is born into unconscionable wealth thats unfair edit and i find the blanket attitude adjustment the author is pushing more than just a little condescending and unnecessary people should by all means find joy in the things in life that are fair and we should condemn and work actively against the things in life that are deeply and horrifically unfair forget this the world isnt broke you are just accept it attitude
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is definitely unfair the article even admits it it just says deal with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,this article massively lacks in necessary cynicism and no im not joking
GetMotivated,not_removed,holy christ im a classic type a and even i think this article is fucked
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing like a bunch of defeatist platitudes contradicted by unattainable existentialism to get motivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,broken idea of fairness entitlement
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive done some furthur thinking on the subject and i agree abit more with what youre saying some kids need it some dont sorry about what i said your life experience cant really be explained in a paragraph certainly not be judged off of one paragraph
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn this article made me grow a couple more corners now im twice as edgy
GetMotivated,not_removed,to me fairness is real but only to the extent that it deals with human affairs life is not fair but we as humans understand that we are all the same and thus the understanding of equality we have rules when we play games thats what makes the game fun fairness and when someone is considered a cheater at games its something a man might never live down but we dont apply that to the rest of man made institutions which makes life no fun for a lot of people there is truth to the phrase life is not fair its not there is illness accidents mistakes all sorts of ways life itself can really fuck you things we have no control over but the things we have control over we should play fair its how we make being people awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,not being content with unfairness isnt the same as presupposing that everything is fair already also most of the people who cheat or game the system use this exact justification ie that if they didnt cheat someone else would have except that if they hadnt then the number of cheaters in the world would have been reduced by at least one
GetMotivated,not_removed,defeatism the only things missing were youre not special and get over yourself and your degree is worthless i hope you starve
GetMotivated,not_removed,look through his blog this guy has some great articles and theyre years old which is strange but interesting i have probably come across him before and forgot
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a wonderful read sometimes we need take a step back before pitying ourselves in order to achieve selfgrowth
GetMotivated,not_removed,this article is despicable and my life is excellent
GetMotivated,not_removed,hahaha oh man holy shit great advice mom and dad nice
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think the biggest problem with this royal sack of shit article is the assumption that everything is a competition life is not a competition your personal happiness cannot be measured on a leaderboard the writer of this article also failed to grasp the meaning of every religion ever dont be a dick it seems like a simple enough philosophy but people dont seem to get it you do not have to try to fuck over your coworker to achieve your goals life is not about winning over your fellow man those who follow this philosophy have always been wealthy shallow and sad i really feel bad for those who follow ayn rand and her philosophy of fuck everyone cause im right and i know it i wish i could show all of you what it means to just be considerate and you will see what it really means to succeed
GetMotivated,not_removed,in some styles of kung fu the idea is you must first lose to win this is especially useful in situations where someone will naturally beat you in a contest of strength you allow them to make their move and then use their own force and movement against them there are probably thousands of ways this can be practically applied in a martial sense but it works in verbal and personal conflicts and as a general rule of thumb for life the taoist tradition often emphasizes the weak over the strong and brings another simple idea into the equation if you can find contentment in less then you are no longer in a competition with the rest of society for more continuing further down the noncompetitive road leads you to recognizing other peoples business is other peoples business if you work to hone your skills and love what you do and love the people you surround yourself with then comparing yourself to others and what they have becomes a moot point because you are satisfying what you truly need as opposed to what youve been socially conditioned to want though i suppose if you want to live with the perspective and anxiety of perpetual competition youre welcome to i think its healthier to approach someones complaint about fairness from the perspective of addressing whatever they truly need thats not being met also this doesnt ignore the plight of those with severe socialeconomic or other handicaps edit tl dr read the tao te ching you dont need to compete to find happiness
GetMotivated,not_removed,this article misses the randomness of life for eg the same song released a few months later could have a very different reception chance could play a large part in picking a winner you can certainly work to improve your chances but that does not mean you will win oberyn martell did not have to die the way he did but he did
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is absolute bs there are people in the world today who dont have a place to live or any guarantee of food to eat many are born into poverty or with extreme disabilities how are they supposed to compete
GetMotivated,not_removed,the author assumes that everyone starts in the same place we dont some people are born near the finish line others are born without legs it should be obvious that we dont live in a meritocracy
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not worth writing so much for something that has infinite answers to
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is fair because it is unfair to everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,now im even more depressed
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love this blogger i wish he would write more
GetMotivated,not_removed,shows what is wrong with this piece according to this line of thinking brain surgeons are not successful because they only impact a handful of people a day
GetMotivated,not_removed,when did anyone ever promise that life would be fair
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really dislike this sentiment and no contrary to what the article says i am not losing im doing very well for myself compared to people my age and i am absolutely very happy with my life with the exception of wanting to be in better physical shape i cant really disagree things are a competition so im not saying he is wrong i just really dont like the attitude and tone i have always strived to be a better person for myself and yes i did read the article and see that he addressed this but i dont like to think of myself as akin to a drowning person willing to force someone under just to stay afloat in some sort of cutthroat contest every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,reward comes down mostly to the number of people you impact is just a gold sentence something i always complain of thanks for sharing very useful article
GetMotivated,not_removed,this probably hit way too close to home for most of reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is an educational institution designed by our true nature in order to explore itself and evolve as anything in the universe therefore there will always be adams apples or evil things that reveal the goodness in each and everyone of us everythings learnt in comparison so thats why you have corruption money competition and jealousy thats why entertainers and sportsmen are paid way way more than they should thats why corporations take control thats why theres always a struggle for each individual no matter the wealth its because were not supposed to be fully at peace here from the get go we just need to learn what that means through pain
GetMotivated,not_removed,some smart ass saw idiots struggling so he invented fairness and all the idiots started loving him the smart ass now had a huge advantage over the other smart asses not to mention the idiots populism fairness
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is a mad game of order and chaos he who understands this is the learned man the earlier the better but he who has conquered them both is the man of success it is from him that one can expect charity friendship and wisdom he indeed is the man worthy of reverence
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminds me pretty heavily of david wongs article both articles are a good motivational kick in the pants
GetMotivated,not_removed,life isnt fair this is what my mom would tell me growing up anytime i complained about something not being fair its solid advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,met gotivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a confused article denying that there is a competition between people lol denying that people are judged by results i dont understand reading third time how is idea of fairness a selfinterest this paragraph looks like a word salad to me judgement of your performance may or may not be fair consider nepotism vs popularity at youtube also it should be extremely obvious that there is absolutely nothing fair in iq distribution or other things that predispose a person for success that doesnt mean that you shouldnt try to the best of your capabilities try convincing someone who had been born in an oppressive regime instead of comfortable western democracy that idea of fairness is not obtainable
GetMotivated,not_removed,great
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldr the problem is that life is unfair but you spend too much complaining about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,because they dont agree with me and they should because i am unquestionably the greatest authority on everything ever in the whole world thats right
GetMotivated,not_removed,if life was fair i would have everything i need and could save for the things i want im a generous accepting caring person who works hard and never calls out or shifts work to other people and believes in giving his fair share in order to make life better for everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,a universe where bad things feel unfair is preferable the alternative is to imply that you deserved it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i freaking love thks guy he has a ton of cool articles including life is a video game super cool
GetMotivated,not_removed,dude no fuck competition
GetMotivated,not_removed,lost me at the first rule life is a competition uh no it isnt boy this author has really been brainwashed competition only exists when there arent enough resources for everyone for example no one on earth competes for oxygen most competition humans experience on a daily basis is completely manufactured by other humans and doesnt exist in real life we have enough food to feed everyone we have enough clothes to clothe everyone and we have enough houses for everyone to live in the fact that we compete for money in order to purchase these items is an enormous failure of human society a small group of humans intentionally hoard resources in order to create false scarcity and try to convince the rest of us to compete at who can best serve their interests life is a competition no youve just been intentionally indoctrinated into that belief in order to serve your masters better
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is absolutely unfair but stop whining about it that doesnt do any good
GetMotivated,not_removed,on the fucking money can anyone recommend a book that lays this out
GetMotivated,not_removed,they need to teach this more is schools enough with the whole everyone is a winner crap is a perfect example tldr nfl player took daughters participation ribbon told her if she wanted a ribbon she needs to come or next races she comes and get rid of the entitlement attitude life doesnt owe you a darn thing if you want something work your butt off get better and be use of the attitude of most people youll come out on top favorite quote the successful are willing to do that which the unsuccessful wont something along those lines
GetMotivated,not_removed,itt i read the article but
GetMotivated,not_removed,no this is wrong on so many goddamn incredible levels
GetMotivated,not_removed,on the money this needs to be taught
GetMotivated,not_removed,something truly unfair in life is death death and illness and disease and being born in a third world country or having a small penis
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is no such thing as fairness everything is a lottery
GetMotivated,not_removed,get naked for one person and you might just make them smile get naked for fifty million people and you might just be kim kardashian this was a highlight but damn its so true
GetMotivated,not_removed,these are the thoughts and opinions of someone suffering from narcissistic persoslity disorder sad really
GetMotivated,not_removed,uh am i the only one thinking whether or not life is fair that doesnt suggest we cant make it fair
GetMotivated,not_removed,soinstead of saying life isnt fair by some arbitrary meaningless subjective standard were just not trying hard enough to be successful by another equally arbitrary meaningless subjective standard the argument is self defeating
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree life is actually really unfair your entire life is mostly determined when god rolls that dice and decide where to put you on the chartered map you being born a blackbrownyellowwhite malefemale in a lowmiddlehigh income family in country makes such a insane difference that it basically determines how much your success is
GetMotivated,not_removed,the title is just semantic bullshit either life is not fair and that is just reality or it is fair however it defies our definition of fairness two ways of coming to the same conclusion
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you everyone you are why when you starve get priced out of your home get a disease are stolen from are raped are privy to a suicide or murder i now know to shrug it off life isnt fair no one is entitled to anything hopefully you starve so there is more for the rest of us hopefully youre easy enough to fool that we can take you resources from you and then laugh thanks this is what you taught thanks the problem isnt that life isnt fair its that you all are such shitty people that the best anyone could hope for would be to take from you and never let you touch a cent remember this is what you wanted and what you would and do default to the second its convenient remember how easy it is to say this to other people so that when youre down you understand why you taught others not to care
GetMotivated,not_removed,the issue with this is that we live in an age where cheaters are becoming either increasingly hard to spot or are so insulated from punishment that it doesnt matter either way to assume humanity is going to play fair with you is optimistic but folly there are plenty of people who value themselves more than the human condition that having been said you dont need to walk around sweeping peoples feet out from under them in the name of the competitive spirit just make sure that youre fully prepared for someone to do it to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,but fairness is a word with so many interpretations some may see fair as giving a handicap to someone who was dealt a bad hand at birth hat they had no control over others may see fair as applying the same rules to everyone regardless of how they were born challenging them to develop other strengths that compensate for their disadvantages on their own and these are the terms of fairness that humans impose upon the natural world
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is really good to add we can design institutions to combat the unfairness of life the parts of life which we can control can be used to render fairer the parts of life we cant control we can compensate people who are worse off due to no fault or choice of their own by redistributing from people who are better off because they have rich parents won the genetic lottery or got any number of other legs up life would still be unfair even if we did all these things but it would be much less unfair life has always been unfair but we have not always been in a position to do something about it every seconds a child dies of a preventable disease the real injustice of life in lies in the fact that we can but choose not to do much about this unfairness
GetMotivated,not_removed,life doesnt discriminate doesnt matter if youre rich poor good or bad shit stuff happens to people and so does good i take that as life actually being fair people on the other hand edit life brings everyone into existence then hands over to chance and the cosmos
GetMotivated,not_removed,too bad people would willing fuck over others for their own benefit and take no responsibility over it we can make it fair but we choose not to source was fucked over by people
GetMotivated,not_removed,but we as humans understand that we are all the same were not even close to being the same were similar but theres significant difference between individuals
GetMotivated,not_removed,good point
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about when we dont agree on the rules when i was single i had no problem hooking up with people who were already in relationships assuming didnt know the other partner in my view thats an issue between the two of them and nothing to do with me im not the one being unfaithful im sure there are plenty of people on here that disagree with me but that doesnt mean that you are right and i am evil its just a differing set of morals weve picked up through out experiences so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,bravo very well written i would love to hear a great orator read this
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldr rich people dont play fair
GetMotivated,not_removed,rules change some people dont get in trouble for breaking rules playing by the rules is sometimes terrible because the rules are bad bad people can make bad rules to hurt you for instance say its feudal times and youre my vassal and im your lord and i tell you that you have to give me of your produce so i can play squashy fruity with a sledgehammer because i think its fun meanwhile youre starving to death because you have to give up of your crop to me thats the rule you should play fair right except you and your farmer friends dont like this and you decide to get rid of me but wait youre not allowed to do that fair play says that vassals serve their lord they dont get to tell me what to do so since fair play states that i dont bother to have any guards or even any weapons so farmers come to my house with pitchforks and try to make a persuasive argument which ends up with them getting to keep all of their crops and me being worm food rules are suggestions everyone breaks them whether by accident on purpose or because theyre just impossible rules to follow its like laws everyone breaks laws every day simply because sometimes its impossible not to sometimes because its stupid not to and sometimes you just dont know better theres a weird idea that rules should always be followed just because theyre rules people should play fair because they should i disagree fully people should provide benefit to eachother and sometimes the greatest benefit to society comes from breaking the rules some of the worst atrocities have been caused by being unwilling to break the rules and causing harm and causing no benefit because the rules say so or because fair is fair rules are things for which there are consequences for breaking them you need to be aware of those consequences sometimes those consequences are that you end up hurting someone sometimes those consequences are that you are punished sometimes theres a promise of consequences that are not carried out
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the things we have control over we should play fair why that makes no sense from an individual perspective people shouldand will seek benefit at the expense of others it just differs how much expense people are willing to ignore
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be fair the phrase life isnt fair is almost exclusively used by people who just finished screwing you out of something
GetMotivated,not_removed,all true within a stable civilized society
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly thank you for saying it so nicely i get so tired of the adage life isnt fair as an excuse to keep the status quo when the reality of the situation is that we as humans control the systems we create and live by ergo we can make things fair if we really wanted to itd just take work and effort we cant control all things but we can control so much that could be improved too
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love it however to everything there is a season and sometimes its time to not play fair but as a general rule i agree with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,but in most ways we arent the same we are all unique
GetMotivated,not_removed,why are you the top comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck yeah i agree
GetMotivated,not_removed,our very nature forbids this youre telling me youve never cheated once in your life on anything evolution has hardwired us to take the path of least resistance sometimes that means cheating
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about when we dont agree on the rules when i was single i had no problem hooking up with people who were already in relationships assuming didnt know the other partner in my view thats an issue between the two of them and nothing to do with me im not the one being unfaithful im sure there are plenty of people on here that disagree with me but that doesnt mean that you are right and i am evil its just a differing set of morals weve picked up through out experiences so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought the same thing but then realized if i really cared about people hearing this message i probably shouldnt downvote it just because i heard the message first from somewhere else with more curse words but having said that yes i think the cracked article by david wong is superior
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree and i think that was the superior article time to reread i disagree with the premise of this article life is unfair and the definition is not so ambiguous but people make the mistake of believing that it is or that it should be
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a teacher thank goodness for parents like you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i come from a home full of apathy my mother father baby sister and older sister all seem to want well nothing really my father died last year and in an attempt to strengthen our family ties i got an apartment with my mom and baby sister ive learned the deep and significant effects that the way our parents raised us has on my baby sis she has zero motivation doesnt seem to want anything whatsoever has zero self discipline she just is she has fun has friends is social dont get me wrong but she just has no values she doesnt even have her own bedroom because she never cared enough to put a bed together or do anything the reason why i bring this up in this conversation in a response to your post is this the way you live your own life really sets the tone for your kids if you are a fat sac of crap then you kids will learn to be fat sacs of crap as well if you are relentlessly motivated have body fat salaries and did it all yourself then your kids will learn to be that as well now this doesnt mean they will be those things but merely be immersed in that kind of life what you tell your kids what you teach them and what you preach to them only matters so much because what you do matters greatly
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love my parents dearly but the fact they never taught me what compound interest is or how and why i need a roth ira or pisses me off i would be worth literally hundreds of thousands of dollars more than i am right now if someone had freaking told me about this stuff instead of me finding out about it rpersonal finance you seem like a good parent so please for the love of god teach your kids these things if they are like me and worked full time while going to school since they were and actually save their money they will be millionaires by i cant believe i thought putting money in my savings account from was a good idea when it could have been invested ugh i also understand why children of wealthy parents are statistically more likely to be wealthy themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like theres a difference between personal value and societal value though like someone who write an unpublished book obviously has produced less societal value than the one who wrote some shitty bestseller but the richness of mind and experience in the first case arent for nothing and while people are in competition for resources at some point you have to realize that the competition is not the end goal and you can opt out when youve attained what you want
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have friends that are the types of parents that over protect and coddle their kids all the way through high school the most important thing that parents need to learn youre not supposed to be raising a child youre supposed to be raising a functioning adult
GetMotivated,not_removed,minutes of chores a week as a parent you know you spend a day taking care of their bs cant wait for my kid to grow up and have them pitch in thats not in a sadistic way its just having a kid now i realized how i wasnt socialized to take care of my chores so now for me its more of a hassle i want to teach my kid just to do it get it done and move on instead of my own personal dread towards some chores thats whats refreshing about being a new parent i can teach what i wish i learned
GetMotivated,not_removed,mins a week is a lot now i do more than that out of practice because i dont want to live in a craphole and enjoy cooking occasionally mins seems pretty reasonable to me from a teenagers perspective
GetMotivated,not_removed,minutes sound very subjective it really depends how efficient the person works with their time and how much time it takes to complete a chore i usually had to take the trash out and help with less frequent chores like mowing the lawn and cutting up trees
GetMotivated,not_removed,the amount of care you have already shown means that even if you get some details wrong you should feel pretty confdent they will turn out ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,most parents these days seem to believe they are raising children what they should believe is that they are raising adults you seem to be one of the few that understand the difference
GetMotivated,not_removed,whining and crying about how unfair it is does not change a damn thing you are right you need to kill people to get what you want not just whine and cry about it thats what the us government does thats what half our country did to end slavery kill those that treat you unfairly history shows it is the only way to make them comply
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre an awesome parent my whole life growing up i felt like i was some side project for my parents they never disciplined me never told me how important money is never gave a damn about my grades and the only advice i received was theres a reason youre alive op its like some weird twilight zone idea that i will be amazing one day i hate that to be successful in the world you do have to compete and being who i am im the complete opposite of competitive
GetMotivated,not_removed,the stoics have a great answer to this thats best summed up by the serenity prayer god grant me serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference correctly identifying whats within your control and focusing your efforts on those things you can change gives you a mental framework that both puts responsibility in your own hands and accepts that not everything will be under your control
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a parent of teenagers i think about this a lot what is the best balance of encouragement and reality im nearing up on now and i feel that my parents and especially my dad really did well with this so ill share give your expectations and leave your kids to do whatever they want let them set goals and let them try to attain them my parents gave me an air of indifference or mild encouragement for the most part this worked out well for me if theyre being stupid or unrealistic you step in and straighten them out firmly and succinctly with grades my parents told me i better not get any cs or id be sorry i got c in quarter of my senior year of hs and my dad almost nailed my ass to the wall other than that they left me alone during school times which was exactly what i wanted i graduated with a and ap classes i took the hard classes because i wanted to and i did well because that was what was expected of me when i was a freshmansophomore i got pretty heavily into game design just out of interest parents said cool do whatever you want but we arent paying for you to go to college to become unemployed so you better find some interests other than game design now that im a few years older pretty sound advice right there tell your kids how it is if their dreams are stupid you might as well tell them when i was a junior i decided to start buyingsellingtrading stuff online since its difficult to make online transactions as a minor i talked to my dad and asked him for help he basically gave me unrestricted access to his bank account on the condition that i paid him cash for every transaction that i made with his account he trusted me to meet his expectation because i had a history of doing so i always paid him and i never spent more than i had when my parents asked me what i wanted to go to college for and i told them what i came up with on my own out of my own interests obscure engineering discipline they supported my decision because there is at least a reasonable potential to get a good return on the investment so i guess what i want to say is that you need to be the real world to your kids youre a parent your job is not to coddle your kid and pretend like everything is going to be all right your job is to firmly set them straight if theyre doing stupid things better you get around to doing it before the world does talk you your kids like theyre adults set clear expectations so long as they meet your expectations let them wander down their own path and take the good with the bad if they dont meet your expectations destroy them with discipline as a parent you legally dont owe your kids a whole lot which is nice because that leaves a lot of stuff to take away if they do stupid shit i would advise you to leverage that against them because a little hard work to earn a lot of freedom is way better than no hard work and no freedom thats my honest advice as an older teen who has been really happy with my parents parenting so long as i toe the line life is good heres the core expectations that my parents have always had for me i suggest you adopt them do well in school dont be caught being an idiot theyre easy to follow as a kid and easy to enforce as an adult
GetMotivated,not_removed,i initially read that as hours of chores and was like wtf
GetMotivated,not_removed,consequences for bad grades less then c i hope you let them slide in english
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats it really isnt it its all just random or too complex to predict shit happening all over the place and you have to try to steer through it
GetMotivated,not_removed,and not just that but also the difference between society and life itself even though the article is technically right on some points such as doing quality work success it seems to treat society and reality as the same thing life is unfair by nature except in death but the way we build society has a huge impact on whether we make it more fair or less do we want to focus on people competing or collaborating etc so what that means in practice is that people are forced to compete in an unequal competition its like playing monopoly but some people play with dices or a dice or start off with more money etc there was an actual psychological experiment that did something like this and people believed they won because of their own skill you can still win but youll have to work harder than some people and less hard than others im new to this subreddit and i havent really checked out the other topics yet so i hope those are more focused on selfimprovement instead nature may be about competition but we would have been extinct if we hadnt focused on group collaboration so much even companies have to have people work together to even be able to compete modern society is a lot more competitionfocused than in ancient times
GetMotivated,not_removed,the tricky part is realizing that at the same time its not all dumb luck you cant throw up your hands and just say why even try ill just let fate decide you need to work hard and at the same time keep lifes unfairness in mind balance is the key
GetMotivated,not_removed,the difference between a starving artist and a miley cyrus is marketing also maybe van gogh was a bad example he was never wealthy or famous in his lifetime
GetMotivated,not_removed,plus you have to account for the competition aspect people will try to take all the credit for the work you did all by yourself life can be beautifulfair people make it shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,dumb luck exists idiots can succeed geniuses can fail you also have to keep in mind that being bornraised as an idiot or genius isnt fair either the only way something like fairness could exist is if we were born with karma from previous lifes get lucky because you were good in a previous life but even then you could just go back further until you hit a dead end or rather beginning this whole notion of fairness really doesnt make sense unless something supernatural that trumps determinism and the illusion of free will is brought into the equation
GetMotivated,not_removed,this line of thinking just gives people an excuse for all of their shortcomings im sure there are a few geniuses that you could cherry pick that failed due to outside circumstances but the vast majority of geniuses go on to be successful and nearly every idiot goes on to be a nobody of people ive spoken with whove gotten unlucky or were screwed by the system just made awful life choices and use these excuses to make themselves feel better
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep
GetMotivated,not_removed,in order to become a level oligmancer you have to know a level oligmancer or you can have invented something that one wanted in the and have successfully fought them for control of it using your level lawbard who went to an ivy league school with your dad
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody gets what they deserve they get what they get
GetMotivated,not_removed,thisthere is no good or bad fair or unfair in life the universe is completely neutral how you choose to perceive it is up to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre arguing semantics here life is unfair youre implying that for something to be unfair someone needs to have made it that way for his or her gain it just existsand it is unfair similarly the author goes to great lengths to disprove that life is unfair but why his core point still stands even if life is unfair the important thing is not whether life is unfair or not its that we realize its true dynamics that they will never change and accept them
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with you also it seems very materialistic more money or attention from the public doesnt equal happiness you dont really know
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree it sounded rather cliche in my opinion the first comment the article wasnt even focused on money but rather resources and there is no denying that money is one of the most important resources in our lives yes people can be happy without fame or fortune or high aspirations but thats the exception not the norm and i dont think that was really the authors intention all he really said is if you want something then work for it and dont blame your failures on things you cant control but of course people who arent successful by normal standards have to jump to their own defense like money isnt happiness dude and i am actually laughing typing this because i say that all the time to my friends who are obsessed with getting rich i just dont think that was the authors intention and people are getting caught up on that missing the point of the article because of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i started taking this advice post and my life has seen a meteoric rise in those years
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a little annoyed that it took so much scrolling to find a comment like this i dont think this article is particularly motivational or even true to real life a lot of it just seems like taking common sense making it more negative and acting as if its some huge statement about how we should live
GetMotivated,not_removed,really i found it extremely motivational and it helped me get off my butt today more than most of the platitudes ive been seeing on this sub i mean yes it looks at everything from a purely materialistic point of view but its still the truth whether you value the things that article assumes you value however is up to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,indeed and adding on your point part of the problem is that we as a society tend not to see these details that guy is vp he must be really talentedhave a great work ethic that guy just got fired he must be a terrible employee
GetMotivated,not_removed,its only an injustice if youre viewing the world in a youcentric manner that family business values their friend more than they value you to give that a person another chance isnt an injustice to them its an effort to keep a valuable friend in their lives
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a stupid mentality to a certain extent society and even from early childhood education tells us our goals are achievable and to never give up or quit because if you keep at it you will get it but the reality is some peoples goalsideas are simply unrealistic or stupidbad ideas and knowing when to quit is a life skill if the odds are stacked against you to the point where you waste years and still dont achieve your goal it probably would have been better to evaluate how realistic said goal or idea was to come to fruition after a couple years and potentially quit whatever it is dont get me wrong working hard and not giving up easily are keys to success but so is knowing when to cut your losses and just quit quitting is underrated edit i am in graduate school for a phd and i know a guy who has been working at his phd at three different institutions over the last years or so and he still has two years left and might not even make it his third try if i were him i would have quit years ago and got a job with a valuable bachelors degree chemical engineering the guy has missed out on around from wages he could of made with his bs degree and a decade of experience he just wont give up and it isnt admirable or impressive its sad that he still has not figured out this isnt for him
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is pretty much the sentiment of napoleon hills think and grow rich book
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly this unfortunately there are so many variables in life that are uncontrollable fairness being one of them in the end it really just comes down to doing what you can to achieve your own goals now whether you take a the high road or the low road thats all on you
GetMotivated,not_removed,that sounds fair
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think many people define value wrong within a capitalist world the way our economy works at least in the us your compensation monetary or otherwise is primarily derived from your economic value not your societal value the more money that you can generate for your organization the higher you are paid often these two values line up but economic value typically trumps social value think high school teacher vs professional basketball player
GetMotivated,not_removed,stock brokers provide little to no or maybe even a negative effect on the world as a whole but regardless they are paid well stock brokers reallocate funding from failing businesses to promising ones investment banking is at the core of how capitalist economies work they provide tremendous value just look at a communist system that doesnt have these kinds of mechanisms and see how well they dont function
GetMotivated,not_removed,utilitarian to an extreme the mentality of a machine
GetMotivated,not_removed,a lot of people out there of every age and type seem to have this ever present depression this the amount of people who are depressed addicted to things and otherwise mentally unhealthy is mindblowing part of it is from not taking action part of it is from the glorification of victims and part of it is from just natural causes but its truly astonishing
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair isnt when everyone gets the same thing fair is when everyone gets what they need thats not fair either life is fair when you get what you deserve
GetMotivated,not_removed,agree to this so much
GetMotivated,not_removed,but nobody is sitting down and deciding how to make it unfair for the rest of us its not malice that makes life so hard for so many people as for creating a high standard of living it might be possible for billion people the earth might sustain this many people probably not with the same carbon footprint of the average american but it might be at least comfortable for all these billion but the population will keep growing growing even faster if people have nothing to struggle for billion people might be sustainable but billion billion eventually there wont be enough natural resources on this earth for everybody whose fault is it then that life is unfair
GetMotivated,not_removed,quite the opposite be super helpful in getting others what they want while taking little of what you want the artist that spends their whole life on their art does a fraction of what a financial planner does for others the artist spends his time only on what he wants and insists its what the world needs the unpopular financial planner gives up his time and gives people jobs loans homes retirements
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a finite quantity of resources available on earth human population is expanding faster than our ability to obtain and replenish these resources someones always gonna lose out in that situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,but its ideology a lot of people live by we have to at least be prepared to deal with them because theyre everywhere creating scarcity and making us play by their rules
GetMotivated,not_removed,the people who have treated me the worst always talk volumes about what a good unselfish person they are
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a very fordian way of looking at the meaning of life competition production and consumption are the whole point in such a world view the i dont value you i value what you can do for me is the sentiment expressed here to these people we are little more than machines who will eventually be replaced by actual machines and not humans with a soul
GetMotivated,not_removed,lets just say that a lot of people are rooting for this to be unchangeable unchallengeable reality because they think screwing each other over is what keeps the lights on and milk in the babies tummies
GetMotivated,not_removed,most importantly never try to pay it forward everything in life is about you doing good turns for others because you were hard done by is just feeding their pathetic delusions
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i live in illinois were not exactly know for our selfless just leaders trying to better peoples lives this guy sounds oblivious to the real world
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read that comment and could only think oh sweet summer child you sit there writing articles about how others need to face the harshness of reality but it seems it is you who will be in for a big reality check once you realize that no the vast majority of our leaders political or otherwise are not wellmeaning and in fact are only really looking out for them and theirs oh the irony
GetMotivated,not_removed,it smacks of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikijustworldhypothesis whoever said it
GetMotivated,not_removed,now imagine if youd sent women picture of your junk youd be a success
GetMotivated,not_removed,of course dontthink pieces like op are intended expressly to stop you from using that ability against certain status quo beliefs and behaviors which a lot of people people who work hard but dont think hard have staked their lives on
GetMotivated,not_removed,too bad any other scenario is dirty commie rat socialism huh
GetMotivated,not_removed,the point of the argument raised in op is to get you used to the idea that theres no changing the rules you can in fact should continue to argue that they can be changed but first you need to rebut that proposition
GetMotivated,not_removed,and that you dont feel the need to do shit about it being done to large numbers of your fellowmen
GetMotivated,not_removed,you lost me when you used tenant instead of tenet your argument may have been good but i didnt read it assuming that someone who didnt know those words couldnt be making a good point thats probably unfair but so is life
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can think of it as the impact a single life saved by a brain surgeon could potentially have in other peoples lives family friends kids etc the life of a single person has endless potential isnt that in part why we try our best to save the sick and also why we are devastated when a child who is full of potential dies in a young age also in the case of say ben carson who successfully operated a twin with joint heads he gave hope to people in the same condition although its not successful he gave these people a chance to be free of the condition that otherwise wont exists
GetMotivated,not_removed,i get you but the down vote is predictable lots of us believe in a httpsenwikipediaorgwikijustworldhypothesis where anytime you get fucked you had it coming somehow typically because you didnt work hard enough in a just world its very important that there be no limit to how hard an individual can work
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a lot man go to tai lopezs website he has a lot of books for that
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if thats adaptive in a narcissistic culture one that rewards not only narcissistic individuals but narcissistic thinking about the culture itself
GetMotivated,not_removed,so there should be no consequences to choice
GetMotivated,not_removed,not being content with unfairness isnt the same as presupposing that everything is fair already also most of the people who cheat or game the system use this exact justification ie that if they didnt cheat someone else would have except that if they hadnt then the number of cheaters in the world would have been reduced by at least one
GetMotivated,not_removed,assuming that humanity will play fair is indeed folly but that doesnt mean that we shouldnt strive to make that a reality
GetMotivated,not_removed,id argue the opposite regarding the age we live in in the past nobility could do whatever the hell they wanted to common folk fair or not a travelling snake oil salesman could go to a new town each week and repeat his scam the list goes on
GetMotivated,not_removed,you say were in an age where cheaters are hard to spot or insulated from punishment why do you simply accept that some people are immune theyre not immune because they declare it themselves no theyre immune because we let ourselves believe theres nothing that can be done dont let yourself think this because nothing is enough for the man who settles for little dont think that someone wont sweep your feet from under you because you believe its not right but instead stand for what is right
GetMotivated,not_removed,the best defense is a good offense or fight fire with fire whichever
GetMotivated,not_removed,there are plenty of people who value themselves more than the human condition what does that even mean
GetMotivated,not_removed,we live in an age where cheaters are becoming either increasingly hard to spot or are so insulated from punishment as if no one ever cheated before no treaty is ever an impediment to a cheat sophocles ca bc
GetMotivated,not_removed,its essentially equal result vs equal treatment a handicap is to give both a winchance ideally equal treatment would be no handicap as setting one would treat one side better than the other
GetMotivated,not_removed,how would you account for redistributing wealth from people who didnt get any legs up and worked to get where they were would you take their money and redistribute it to people lower on the socioeconomic ladder i think thats confusing equal protection under the law and an equal chance to succeed with equal outcomes for all
GetMotivated,not_removed,life discriminates like fuck if you are poorer you will die younger also if you are not the dominant species your odds of being eaten are really damn high life isnt fair in the least but thats not the job of life it is however the job of our legal system our government structures to provide some measure of fairness
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wish this was actually true
GetMotivated,not_removed,or as is often the case they fuck you over for their own benefit and then engage in all manner of mental contortions to convince themselves that this is fair the article talks about the distinction between what you feelthink and what you do this is a key point on many fronts i suspect if most people put their dreams and goals and plans and ideas and intrinsic qualities down on one sheet of paper and their concrete actions in that direction on another and compared them theyd be very uncomfortable we like to think of ourselves as good and were better at thinking it than we are at being it this creates a situation where responsibility is the enemy if we do something noticeably unfair to someone our awareness of it is likely unpleasant and our options are make it right make it go away make it justified the first option apologize and make reparations is uncomfortable and might cost us something the second sweep it under the rug and assume they didnt actually lose much is convenient and easy and covers a multitude of small things and the third convince ourselves theyre an assholeidiotenemy who deserved it is solid satisfactory and can justify further unfairness of greater magnitude up to and including actual malice we see the three options at play in society at large the impetus to fix things seen as unfair the inertia of the way things are due to people not finding it worth the effort to fix and the setin opposition of people who argue that its deserved or escapable and thus is fair the other problem is that we live in such a resoundingly complex system with everybody having different ideas of whats fair different ways of defining fairness golden rule vs platinum rule same vs equal your right to swing your fist ends at my nose or at the trigger point of my avoidance reflexes egalitarianism vs hierarchy merit hierarchy vs seniority hierarchy et cetera different senses of harm derived from the same action different possibilities of harm derived from the same action differing access to or value of opportunities and subjective valuation of whats offered to name only a few issues that its near impossible to do much about it we can point out our observations define a few concepts engage in thought experiments like would it still be fair if the positions were reversed and otherwise try to increase awareness of how people might fail at fairness or kindness while thinking theyre succeeding but ultimately its up to each individual to decide what their standards are and how rigorously to uphold them and who to listen to in shaping them often indeed we choose not to and often we tie ourselves into knots in order to call it something else and sometimes we just fail and sometimes we just cantwontdont agree on whats fair its a complex puzzle to be sure
GetMotivated,not_removed,we can make it fair but we choose not to not trying to pick a fight but imo youre doing the same kind of fairness as wish fulfillment thing that the article is talking about there are always going to be people who will act against your interests there is no system of society or government that could possibly be implememted to eliminate this usually the reason people act against your interests is because it furthers their own interests to do so its not possible to live in a world where everyone else wants you to succeed as much as you want to succeed because were all in competition for finite resources just like the article says you cant have a world where no one fucks you over because other people do not exist to serve your interests above their own where does the concept of fairness come in when people help you or befriend you its also almost always because its in their own interest to do so fairness comes from mutualism from having something to offer others that you can then get rewarded for there is an escape from the zerosum game but it involves having something to offer that other people will want to reward you for not by wishing you can somehow mind confrol other people to want you to succeed
GetMotivated,not_removed,we can make it fair but we choose not to no we cant make it fair its a nice thought but it just is not realistic doesnt mean we shouldnt try but life will never truly be fair for everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with you these social constructs we call rules dont apply to everybody not everybody will be honourable not everybody will be truthful being deceitful can have its advantages in certain situations doesnt mean you were evil honour means nothing to those who dont recognise it ultimately youre right youre not the one being unfaithful and the person who is being unfaithful may very well think why should i be faithful to one partner im just here to enjoy life and have fun the only gripe i have with this sort of thing is those who live their own lives play by their own rules and shit all over the playing board then turn around and blame people for judging them and cant cop the fact that if you play against the game of what is perceived to be the unspoken rules of social constructs youre going to get some criticism i agree with you youre your own person and at the end of the day you do you but for example if people start calling you a whore slut homewrecker or just ultimate end up with a bad reputation you know its your fault its not who you are its who people see you are thats legit how the world works
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you feel the same way about the dude who hooks up with your so because if not then you are not being fair otherwise you simply have a different set of selfconsistent morals
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is true that all is fair with love and warjust remember all is fair so you may think that your relationship with someone has nothing to do with another relationship that that person harbors but in reality based at least on my experience and of course logic that should you decide to hook up with that person you are subjecting yourself to other spheres of influences ill just sum it up from here asdont be surprised when you get your ass kicked
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you literally were dealt unplayable hands from the beginning of the game to the end youd probably complain about variance yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,well did you make the suggestion or did the cheater
GetMotivated,not_removed,brian brushwood if so big fan
GetMotivated,not_removed,read the ops article then read the cracked article cracked article wins in a landslide of laughter
GetMotivated,not_removed,this hits close to home could you elaborate on how that apathy was being transmitted in the day to day home life to you and your sister i have some issues with motivation and i wouldnt want to hurt my family because of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,no idea why youre getting downvoted because i agree wholeheartedly i count my lucky stars every day that my dad taught me about finances growing up and no he wasnt a banker or a corporate exec he was just savvy with money and read books now my peers in their come to me for financial advice and im stunned how many of them havent invested in anything except a savings account
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont see how you can make hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages to then invest before you know what compound interest or an ira is thats something you should be learning in college when youre still too broke to be investing
GetMotivated,not_removed,on the flip side ive known about a lot of these things since elementary school because i was fortunate enough to live in a great school district however ive never actually had the means to utilize this knowledge
GetMotivated,not_removed,at when i was moving out my parents gave one tidbit of advice regarding finances having a credit card means you can buy stuff now and just pay it back later just fucking lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,the reason they are more wealthy is because their parents were wealthy and their parents parents were wealthy and when you have generations and generations of compound interest the amount of money you make is insane then everybody in your family gets private educations and private colleges and has friends of friends who can get you into an internship that will catapult your career no worries that its unpaid your familys legacy fund will continue to pay out for those few years you can take the risk for those big jobs or that career that may not be as easy to get into right out of college
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hate to break it to you buddy but thats just more wishful thinking on your part the older they get the more needs they have and gets compounded the more kids you have i too thought it would get easier as they got older but heres just a few things this month on the list thats checked off driving lessons graduation graduation party and family coordinated gift after school sports and activities dating and coordinating with their parents to help keep the hankypanky down so that babies dont happen sorry to be the one to break it to you but there is hope alcohol is widely available
GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure what youre saying basically sounds like youre saying it is what it is but i dont want to jump to conclusions i already made the point that youre stuck with the cards youre dealt and that just because your hand sucks doesnt mean you cant win if you play harder and they play badly just if you both play as hard youll likely lose
GetMotivated,not_removed,and catch the right opportunities as they come
GetMotivated,not_removed,and one of the things you do have some control over are your atbats theres a lot of noise but you can increase the strength of the yousignal in some ways improve at your thing and do it a lot its not a guarantee but it increases your odds
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is a bit like poker the hands are random but you can work with them and play the odds sometimes you get fucked sometimes you luck out and most of the time you have at least a little something you work with
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminds me of the saying luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity the opportunity may not come its not guaranteed but you can jump on a little luck if your ready for it job interview maybe that coursera course you took solves a similar problem to the one they have right now exercised twice this week well guess what that heart attack just got postponed a month maybe the last example isnt a good one but you get my point
GetMotivated,not_removed,milton friedman
GetMotivated,not_removed,as we say in the elementary teaching biz while handing out crayons you get what you get and you dont throw a fit
GetMotivated,not_removed,deserve aint got nothing to do with it snoop the wire
GetMotivated,not_removed,one thing to realize in this however is that we as human beings are not completely neutral if you do more good things for people there are more people who will want to do good things for you i loaned my friend some money many years ago and forgot all about it i was really hard up for cash and wondering what i was going to do when he called me out of the blue and said he had my money for me i was like money yea man remember sorry it took me so long i really appreciate it in my experience doing good and having faith that things will work out has proven itself time and time again i have one story that really stands out i gave a stranger my last cigarette and he said dude i cant take your last cigarette man no worries i said the universe will get me back about minutes later the sprinklers came on and everyone i was sitting with ran away from the picnic table we were laughing and one of my friends came up to me and said dude you left your cigarettes on the table he handed me a pack that clearly wasnt mine and i had never seen before i opened it up and there was a single cigarette inside have faith people
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a pile of bullshit is it completely neutral that a kid who is born to poor uneducated parents has years less life expectancy and a hell of a lot less lifetime earning expectation than an identical kid who is born to richer parents
GetMotivated,not_removed,also what is up with that bullshit graph that claims reward is proportional to people impacted if i wrote a chord pop song and it made me millions of dollars i would be rich but not emotionally rewarded because that kind of music doesnt resonate with me to be emotionally fulfilled i need to make or do things that i want to see exist in the world impacting the most people is just about appealing to the lowest common denominator
GetMotivated,not_removed,ironically thats the just world fallacy at work
GetMotivated,not_removed,in all fairness the family owner is acting selfishly in protecting their own they just get to be mecentric because they own the company i suppose they could have done something that impacted millions of people or they could have inherited their position i get that this little blog or whatever is saying people need to face reality but whats wrong with saying the way things work should change at this point im of the opinion that socialism is the only way forward itll never work if we keep these outdated attitudes though
GetMotivated,not_removed,while it is debatable if he should have quit or not i am interested in what motivates him given our theme in this sub and all
GetMotivated,not_removed,your example relies a lot on hindsight anyone can look back and see what they could have done better but as long as you dont mind continually reevaluating your goals just keep making the best decision you can with the information you have at the time
GetMotivated,not_removed,i people quit after though the world would look a bit different i agree with you somewhat but that means steve jobs would have left apple before ever developing the imac iphone or ipod and revolutionizing much of the world for example how do we account for such cases
GetMotivated,not_removed,society and even from early childhood education tells us our goals are achievable and to never give up or quit because if you keep at it you will get it apart from this your whole comment can be inverted and it has the same validity dont get me wrong working hard and not giving up easily are keys to success but so is knowing when to cut your losses and just quit dont get me wrong knowing when to cut your losses and just quit is key to long term success but so are working hard and not giving up easily etc etc yeah the most effective way thru life is to invest as much effort as needed to succeed where you can and walk away when its undeniable you just dont have what it takes that said i wholeheartedly agree that we as a society need to push back on the idea that dream it believe it achieve it is an infallible modus operandi your example seems to perfectly illustrate that
GetMotivated,not_removed,knowing when to quit is a life skill preach brother in my youth i had musical aspirations spent six years in two different bands when the second one disbanded i took a hard look at the likelihood of actually making a living in music and got a desk job
GetMotivated,not_removed,mike row says it well here
GetMotivated,not_removed,but you seem to be saying that getting his job and making that a year would make him happy would satisfy him if what he truly desires is a phd he should pursue it even if it takes him tries if thats even allowed you could easily look at this kind of situation this way either i pursue my dream which will almost certainly make me happy either in its fulfillment or the path there or i settle for a safe choice that will not amuse me in the slightest the latter could lead to depression and ultimately at its most dramatic suicide so really it could come down to achieve my dream or do i just end my life here since i wont be able to live my life happily without it
GetMotivated,not_removed,economic value and social value are pretty similar people pay for what they value teachers may be extremely valuable taken together but individually they are not that important especially in our current system
GetMotivated,not_removed,username checks out i read this article during a useless meeting
GetMotivated,not_removed,that seems like kind of a jaded way of thinking especially in the context of equalityaccessibility but i guess it depends on your definition of need
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i question that people arent sitting down and deciding how to make life unfair for others we know a lot about how money and wealth flow cycle and change hands yet trickle down economic policies still exist even if by a different name no that may not be out of malice but its out of a complete lack of sympathy or empathy for others and a complete disinterest in their existence as humans and yes its the scarcity of resources that makes life unfair will always prevent life from being completely fair but embracing a free for all attitude towards those resources intentionally creates even greater scarcity life is both competition and cooperation when we push to hard to one side or another we make life more unfair than it needs to be and thats on us as humans
GetMotivated,not_removed,human population wouldnt be expanding if our system wasnt growth based i wish we would rid ourselves of this idea that growth progress
GetMotivated,not_removed,we dont have to play their rules especially if we dont want that ideology to rule our childrens lives we can one action at a time built up alternative economies of resistance and solidarity
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats right but my problem is as i understand the text the author wants us to adapt to this situation and thats kinda freakish for many reasons for one the overall situation is in my opnion not worthy of defending or accepting for two this situation is basically a blueprint for a capitalistic mindset competition is everywhere and everything although a little bit more honest because he admits at least that even if you work hard you can fail which most capis dont see but the real thing is one of the biggest pros of capitalism was that it was so nigh to the actual human behavior now i read thi which basically admits it isnt very nigh to human behavior at least for good chunk of people
GetMotivated,not_removed,paying back would make sense paying it forward is nonsense
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre usually at best obnoxious and at worst politicians dont need em
GetMotivated,not_removed,valar morghulis
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair response ill give it some thought
GetMotivated,not_removed,good answer because lots of things are held to be facts without any logical explanation and that too can be explained by lifes unfairness
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think gangnam style views on youtube is worth even a single life though so i maintain my position
GetMotivated,not_removed,to add to that this line of reasoning is why we have such a problem with corruption when the only thing that matters is the end result and not the journey along the way youll end up stepping on anyone you can just to get to the top instead of fairness people should check their expectations of others at least in the us people are accustomed to the best and often will only settle for the best whatever that may be so much so that if we perceive we are not getting the best or the most out of something we think we are being cheated when in fact our standards of often too high for too many things when foreigners think we are narcissistic its because they see us engaging in this kind of behavior driven by this attitude sure it may have gotten us many a great thing but like facebook we only see the end results of success and we would do well to have more of a peek into what it took to get that success as well as see the failures
GetMotivated,not_removed,its better to strive for a ruleset where there isnt a huge advantage in cheating its obviously harder but the reality is as long as cheating gives an advantage people will do it doesnt matter if its competitive sports bussiness or anything else where people compete
GetMotivated,not_removed,people still do that in a modern way even on the internet the modern snake oil salemen creates sites selling fake goods get enough vitctims close down before it gets known widely create new site repeat instead of different town just different site then you have empty promises in form of kickstarters that never even try to deliver and the list goes on
GetMotivated,not_removed,id argue that we did live in an age of culpability albeit briefly and are now returning to the prior condition of feudal relations between rich and poor
GetMotivated,not_removed,i bought some snake oil lotion in china its actually nice on the hands and smells pretty good
GetMotivated,not_removed,he says that because it is true just believing it to be so doesnt make it that way i really really want some of the architects of the crash to go to jail but that aint gonna happen this article is about practical reality and the practical reality is that there are people who are immune to the consequences of their actions tough the rest of us just have to keep scraping by there isnt going to be justice dont lie to yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,we are immune because were smarter and more prepared and likely because we have been raised to get ahead at all costs besides i was born without ever agreeing to following any laws i dont recognize them i am therefore not cheating i do realize that when people find out i am cheating in their eyes they will force me to do something before i can go back to what i feel is my right others morals and values are of no importance to me i have my own this doesnt even mention loopholes im very fond of idiots writing vague laws i can take apart and use as i see fit im finishing my second degree before a third before im a poor student with a job making a year through cheating and im paying taxes on top of that i still get from the government loophole yep this is one of my few non trolling posts with this account there is no right and wrong no justice those are all subjective all there is is riskreward or costbenefit ill be able to retire before ill be doing whatever i feel like by youre not going to win if youre following the rules others laid out make your own rules
GetMotivated,not_removed,first off i think theres no such thing as a person who didnt get any leg up simply having a functioning economy today requires all sorts of resources whose costs are borne largely by others from police to roads to judiciary to currency to armed forces to labour laws to international trade agreements and there is hardly anyone who hasnt benefited from some additional public service or another if only early public education and most people benefit heavily from some such service or another but to answer the spirit of your question no i dont think that equal outcome is fair either i dont think its unfair when a person has more than others because of how hard they have worked and dont have a problem with them being better off than others who put in less effort or made less prudent choices and indeed i think it is unfair when people who put in very different effort have the same amount but the social and economic inequalities which could result from differential exercises of effort and choice would be microscopic compared to what we have now first because as it stands people earn hundreds of thousands of times what other people earn and no one works a hundred thousand times harder than someone else second the market rewards not effort mainly but talent and capital both of which are legs up all that said i think there are some good reasons to believe that even the effort and the choices we make are ultimately caused by factors beyond our control like our genes and earlychildhood experience and i am inclined to think that if this is true then any and all inequality is unfair period
GetMotivated,not_removed,ha go ahead just wanted to sum things up it sounds true but im sure someone could pick it apart edit hamilton the musical made me think about this thread one of the songs wait for it has the lyrics love doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints it takes and it takes and it takes then goes onto life doesnt discriminate between the sinners and the saints it takes and it takes and it takes good song
GetMotivated,not_removed,what i hate about this objectivity as true as it is its that it just feels as if its justifying or saying yeah its whatever thats how things turned out to be about someone being born a child soldier in africa or something thats fucked up something should be done but at the same time its just meh society wont even put them out of their misery let suffering exist call it life there is no fairunfair just life it just points out that being selfish is best that selfishness isnt unfair fucking over people for your own benefit and having others suffer just so you can have a few more dollars or whatever perfectly fine its not fair or unfair just life its logical i just fucking hate it youre not wrong though not arguing or anything just stating my opinion of how much i hate it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont perceive any aggression so ok anyways its just that theres two ways one way where both parties benefit like you said mutualism and theres the parasitic way where one benefits but harms the other natures typical course too bad most people choose the latter
GetMotivated,not_removed,i guess i mean in a completely objective viewpoint there really is no rightwrong fairunfair just survival even if it means subjectively fucking people over and driving them towards suicidal ideationattempts and taking no responsibility for it after all it did benefit them
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes id be angry with my so but not guy involved all he provided was at most the opportunity it would be her that chose to break my trust its not his job to stop my partner from cheating on me
GetMotivated,not_removed,yuuuup thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,well my parents dont do shit like my dad used to have hobbies we used to play video games together and he worked on electronics stereos for years but then he lost his job and kinda job hopped for the rest of his life they didnt really go out they never pushed us to do anything like when i was years old my dad put a guitar in my hand and when i didnt want to practice he was all like well if you dont want to practice then thats okay and just kinda moved on but i was and had zero self discipline and had never accomplished anything so i really needed to be shown how hard work pays off and what i was capable of my mom and dad were so neutral and i turned out pretty well but i still struggle with keeping myself on top of everything and driving myself i feel like i will always center around being lazy despite all of my efforts and successes take your kids on vacations and show them the world push them to get good at something so they can see that they can develop even if only to a fundamental level find out who they are and what they want but also understand that they dont know what theyve never done never been to and never seen how would they teach them what it means to do something that is good for you something to growdevelop yourself and how to appreciate those things instead of only valuing whats fun or easy teach them things that dont have immediate or obvious value like recycling or most socially responsible concepts those things are hard to learn on your own because on a personal consumer individual level you never see the benefits or consequences of your actions my parents gave me a lot of insight as to how i want to raise my kids both what they did and didnt do
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha who care about votes 😆 good on ya mate
GetMotivated,not_removed,because chemical engineering doesnt include pf classes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope im not being delusional but that seems way easier than taking care of babies in logistic terms my daughter is and theres a lot of stuff that i can now make her do clean her room prepare breakfast that wasnt possible before i think that in a couple of years is going to be even easier as she becomes more independent but were not there yet so i dont know how its gonna work
GetMotivated,not_removed,cheers
GetMotivated,not_removed,opportunities are not always available or easy to see and evaluate
GetMotivated,not_removed,and realize that those opportunities dont come to everyone so appreciate your luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,that heart attack example though
GetMotivated,not_removed,he really just said that the the basic source for apartheid in south africa was the insistence by trade unions on equal pay for equal work holy shit this man is a respected economist how
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh my wife same line of work uses something similar you get what you get and you dont get upset
GetMotivated,not_removed,i definitely agree with your first two sentences and they are very important to understand but the rest of what you said is completely contradictory to the article being a better person may give others more opportunity and desire to be good to you but it is not the universe getting you back its the social environment you created or are a part of or coincidence i can think of plenty of examples in my own life like yours about the cigarettes but also plenty that didnt go my way too
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea i also agree and think that this is pretty much a perfect example of how karma can work and the whole the universe works in mysterious ways perception
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup the universe doesnt care about money and a whole bunch of things you probably do
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe the owner only foundedbought the company so he could set his kids and friends up and secure their future there is no reason a privately owned business has to be fair in hiring people a publicly controlled business would be a very different story as that would involve a betrayal of the shareholders interests
GetMotivated,not_removed,instead of asking for everyone else to change how they do business i like to look at this kinds of instances and see if there are ways in which i can change myself and take action to get the results i want perhaps i can leverage my network or even become that employer whos able to help his family
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd be surprised some people just do it because they decided theyd do it and wont stop until they do my girlfriend tried for her cpa for four years until getting it spending tons of money cpa courses and exams arent cheap and time on it and making both of us miserable i supported her fully but when i asked why it was so important to her she would just say its a personal goal she hasnt even needed it her profession doesnt quantify cpa and she honestly hates accounting i get the whole follow your dreams thing and dont let failure deter you but sometimes you need to step back and think about the pros and cons of following that dream for the cpa example it cost us lots of time money and stress for something that really wasnt all that worth it just because following your dreams is something youre supposed to do and admitting defeat is considered weak and embarrassing
GetMotivated,not_removed,it doesnt at all depend on your definition of need for one i dont want to live in a society where people only get what they need for two paying people based on what they need and not what theyre worked for is extremely unfair thats basically communist philosophy
GetMotivated,not_removed,they do have that right
GetMotivated,not_removed,human population is growth based have more than kids and youre creating more humans than there were before perhaps if we want a system that isnt growth based well have to stop our population from expanding of course youll have to tell that to all of the developing nations that are most responsible for the modern population explosion
GetMotivated,not_removed,hat tip valar dohaeris
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not necessarily true that the army that was doing the pillaging always won their war there were many instances where the defenders won
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not asking for unreal expectations im simply asking that you do whats in your power to make things right because as long as men die liberty will live on sending the architects of the crash to jail is probably out of our power but someone somewhere in hisher reality might have that power im simply stating its your own responsibility to make good happen around you because others wont do it for you thinking they will is the lie
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe if people like you stepped up and said enough bullshit instead of letting it happen we can only act shellshocked for so long before were letting it happen to ourselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am le freeman of the land i dont recognize this court
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think the article said that at all objectivity doesnt mean this is the way things are deal with it it just means most people view fairness as it relates to them for better or worse
GetMotivated,not_removed,appreciate your open mindedness i guess what im arguing against is the idea that other people could be fair to you at no cost to themselves and simply choose not to because they love being dicks there are a few people like that out there but for the most part they tend not to do very well in life being antisocial and not able to function well in society of the time its not some sadistic choice the other person makes just because they love being unfair its usually very easily understood via a costbenefit analysis why people do the things that they do people dont choose to be parasitic instead of mutual because theyre awful they do it because thats the easiest way for them to look after themselves i just think its important to recognize that other people are by and large not fucking you over because they think being evil is rad when you get fucked its almost always because theres a conflict of interest its an important distinction because you can succeed by surrounding yourself with the right kind of person while having something to offer if you think the world is full of backstabbing sadists who get their rocks off on dicking you over its just going to convince you that life is unfair and theres nothing to be done about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,have you considered maybe the reason you have no motivation is because thats what you keep telling yourself motivation is doing things even if they feel hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hear what youre saying and i agree on some points but come on you dad didnt force you to practice guitar so that means you didnt learn self disciple do you know what self discipline is its when yourself motivates you being smacked with a stick is not how you raise ambitious people or discipline people honestly alot of your post seems pretty blamey why oh why did my parents not make me do these thinngs if you think motivation is given by others youve already lost if they loved you provided for you and supported you you had more than enough required to succeed
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre already in a great spot just for the fact that youre pursuing this information at such a young age head over to rpersonalfinance and they will answer every question you have good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure if they downvoted you for the sake of irony or not 😂
GetMotivated,not_removed,i did electrical engineering and most definitely had to know what compound interest was before graduating lol you think most people get stockpicking advice from their parents
GetMotivated,not_removed,im pretty damn sure ive learned about compound interest sometime in jr high from the typical public education although like almost everything else from grade school most adults dont remember what they learned but when you put it to practice via borrowing money from friends at absurd rates then youll never forget about it in your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,long and the short of it is it depends entirely on your kid and where theyre at oddly its like theyre all their own individual people go figure
GetMotivated,not_removed,never underestimate your childs ability to make your life harder im not saying it isnt wonderful that they can get themselves up in the morning its that they need help in other ways and still keep you busy they want adult privileges like working driving dating and partying yet you as a parent need to help make that happen i guess if i only had one kid i have a son and daughter i might not feel like im pulled in so many different directions at once let me just finish this with thank god i have good kids but i cant wait until theyre both out of the house some days they are like the worst roommates ive ever had
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the problem with effective randomness as opposed to fairness some people just get shat on and never get any workable opportunities then they get some hideous disease and die best not to dwell on that though
GetMotivated,not_removed,because he deals in reality rather than the emotionally conjured fiction pushed forward by progressives
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not about understanding the intentions of an economic policy its about understanding the results of an economic policy a good politician will come up with a bunch of excuses for why his policy failed a good economist will identify the reasons an economic policy failed
GetMotivated,not_removed,its truly insane how well it works so i imagine it spreads like wildfire
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know this is how karma is used in common speech but fwiw the actual belief in karma only impacts a persons next existence
GetMotivated,not_removed,the universe doesnt care about money sure but this isnt money the universe doesnt care about anything because it has no existence as a thinkingfeeling thing but that doesnt make it fair and it isnt completely neutral either
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think this gets to the point of the article the employee in this scenario is wrongly expecting that the owner should make decisions based on whats good for the employee in reality the owner only owes the employee payment for the services heshe provides
GetMotivated,not_removed,god that is almost a nonexample my father basically bankrupted our family and continues to make my mother live in poverty to spend all of their money on a business that has never produced even in revenue over years
GetMotivated,not_removed,my point is that essentially if some people like steve jobs dont play the lottery we will all be much worse off you do not give a good answer there lets live in a world without any progress seems like a piss poor response to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think youre missing my point in the context of fairness and equality in accessibility and human rights people have the same basic needs but perhaps require more resources in terms of time and energy or attention to fulfill those needs she had a graphic to describe this that was super simplistic like two children trying to peer over a fence one child required a box to see over the fence one child obviously received more but the same need was met does that make more sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,as it is humans are part of the growth equation as either consumers or human resources of which there is an ever growing need removing the imperative for growth as dictated by the present capitalist system should stop the exponential rise in population
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if the architects of the crash were elected officials and bureaucrats as well as bankers is it fair for those just as guilty of the crime to be the punishers of those who didnt have the privilege of being an elected official or an appointee
GetMotivated,not_removed,we are letting it happen to ourselves why kid ourselves every day we go to work and leg them stick it to us thankful that we have a paycheck and a place to live
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont recognize the laws laid out i do however accept that not following them can have consequences catch me and ill pay the price but with how incompetent most people are especially law enforcement nope
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with most of your points except for the there are a few people like that out there but for the most part they tend not to do very well in life being antisocial and not able to function well in society few people no many people a bit too much tend not to do very well in life the people im dealing with are from wealthy families know how to manipulate people incredibly intelligent also all are tall white males they have life stacked for them and instead of even taking the time to help othersmake a positive difference they take more and more from everyone else i agree with you what theyre doing is completely logicalrational its survival and theyre doing what is most convenient for them in terms of cost effort vs benefits i just find it fucking disgusting
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly no because i didnt tell myself that for most of my life its only when ive reached for things that ive realized my own aversion to trying hard however i do enjoy being called on my bs because self justifying and deceiving is perfect for dying mediocre if any of that makes any sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,now i dont disagree with you in full i merely analyze what outside factors existed as a kid and teenager and ive noticed the same thing happening to my sister and while i take ownership of what i do now i cant help but notice that im facing these things for the first time in my life as an adult instead of as a kid its why i described my parents as neutral because my dad after some nagging would have bought me the guitar but then again done nothing to support practicing i dont expect most kids to be self starters so when i have children i really want to kinda scoot them through the starts of things so they can see the ends if that makes sense also a huge factor i feel like id have been better off if i faced this kind of stuff when i wasnt working full time while being a full time student as a university at age while married with tons of responsibilities i know that looking to others for motivation isnt really anything to consistently draw from or stand upon if you want something you have to be the one to make it happen i just cant help but feel like my center of gravity is what i had been up until a few years ago having my mother and sister live with me is like living with the ghosts of my old habits again this post wasnt about placing blame or putting ownership on others merely an observation of similarities between how i was raisedwhat my parents didand how i tend to be without proactively being different
GetMotivated,not_removed,fundamentally i think this is true but not necessarily to a young kid a huge part of self motivation is a recognition of how far youve come from your beginnings which you can then extrapolate onto how much further you can grow if you stick to whatever it is that you are doing young kids lack the perspective really necessary for that i think
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks yeah i took a personal finance class when im high school and they briefly went over the stock market and investing i just want a little more advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,being more precise i knew what it was but not how it is applied across financial industry except for the most obvious examples eg you learned what a redox reaction is and how it works and even that it applies to electrochemistry and batteries but not that it fuels the space shuttle most people know about compound interest with credit cards and why they are scary bad but not how they are applied to retirement accounts let me provide an example you have three investors susan who invests per year only from ages to years susan ends with bill who also invests per year but from ages to years bill ends with and chris who also invests per year but from ages to yearschris ends with intuitively it makes sense that chris would end up with the most money but the amount he has saved is astronomically larger than the amounts saved by susan or bill interestingly susan who saved for just years has more wealth than bill who saved for years that discrepancy is explained by compound interest you have to admit you had no fucking clue about that discrepancy when you were years old or probably even and that is not something you ever learned in university
GetMotivated,not_removed,well in my experience everything about working dating and driving was managed by myself only never asked for anything but maybe my parents should have been more involved hehe
GetMotivated,not_removed,but in an ideal situation this can be remedied and that is how we must work we shall not see no improvements if it is not pursuit to say meh fuck that life is unfair deal with it git gud is not helping anyone is only making more difficult to people who actually try to make life fair because as as concept fairness exist say fairness doesnt exist is the same as to say that freedom or the colour blue dont exist
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the reality is that equal pay was in no way the source of apartheid rather apartheid and the attempt to keep the south african blacks from taking jobs was the cause for laws which restricted the hiring of blacks including requirements to pay a certain amounts eg equal pay
GetMotivated,not_removed,he said that the source for apartheid was trade unions he is historically incorrect yes the laws advocated for by those unions were in support of the white supremacy of apartheid but they didnt cause it in any way shape or form
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the very fact that it doesnt think is precisely what makes it neutral i cant say i have any idea how the universe works but what you may think is unfair welfare for example may be fair to someone else that needs it the universe isnt trying to appeal to either one of yousome might argue here that they can swing the universe by praying to godoh the rabbit holes
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes well said a private business is just an extension of the self in many ways and in the case of a sole proprietorship thats exactly what it is i wonder if people have really thought through all the implications of their selfserving ideas about fairness why not force straight men to sleep with other men in the name of fairness for example at what point do we draw the line in forcing people to go against their own interests whether their interest lies in giving a friend a job as a leg up or keeping their anal vcard ah forget it whos john galt
GetMotivated,not_removed,potatoes
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmm what if i were to disagree that growth is a bad thing as a species more individuals means more contribution to the economy to the sciences and hopefully a strong incentive to move off planet
GetMotivated,not_removed,is it fair for those guilty of a crime to jail others guilty of the same crime fuck no im concerned that we would think of letting it all go just because everyone is doing it thats corruption at its finest and essentially how the market crash of happened in the first place
GetMotivated,not_removed,nowhere did i exclude elected officials from my statement not sure where you got that from
GetMotivated,not_removed,i got it sorry if i came across as a bit condescending ididntmeantoiwasjusttryingtohelp
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you me this is the exact thing i want people to understand and all they do is accuse me of being lazy i mean if i have never got the exposureif i was never pushed to work hard to get rewarded then how the heck am i gonna learn all that even worse was that till i was everyone around me had destroyed my self esteem they all told me ill amount to nothing and that i am a social retard and whatever i say doesnt have value and that it doesnt matter whatever i try is useless because i have no talent and i cant do anything right then i studied hard and became one of the topper in my last year of high school after that people are constantly asking me why i havent learned all the things that a normal year old has learned guess what you never taught me anything and never supported me in anything either now ill have to learn everything on my own and i feel as if i am years behind my peers in terms of learning life lessons
GetMotivated,not_removed,youve put it nicely i actually thought about your comment on the bus home and i think youre right in a way different kids require different things being pushed helps being challenged helps too so i get what youre saying now an initial model can have lasting effects good luck man
GetMotivated,not_removed,just in case anyone read this and got confused he means susan only saves for years but still holds that money for another years after the first years susan will have saved that over years with no additional savings besides interest is you didnt explain it poorly but i also hear a lot of people make compound interest sound much larger than it is and dont want people thinking they get screwed out of retiring at because they didnt save a year silly i know but surprisingly a common mistake
GetMotivated,not_removed,why does bill get less teach me daddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,my son never really wanted to bring his dates home and keeps to himself but my daughter is a complete polar opposite friends and boyfriends over hope i didnt come across as preaching just didnt think i would be this busy at this point in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,unions supporting laws for apartheid didnt help create apartheid okay thanks for clearing that up
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a difference between being neutral meaning not favoring any particular party in any way and being unthinking a metaphor that may makes sense is lightning it doesnt think but i can assure you that standing on top of the mountain with an umbrella means that you are much more likely to be struck by lightning than someone in a valley without a metal object this means the location where lightning strikes is not neutral meaning not favoring anyone or anything but the lightning remains unthinking
GetMotivated,not_removed,grab your ankles for the good of mankind now theres an idea i can get behind
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre the next big thing youll seeyoull all seee
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre so sassy
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not following your example what are you suggesting you dont think the universe is neutral so its biased somehow
GetMotivated,not_removed,im pretty sure an exgirlfriend of mine embraced that philosophy haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel you haha thats why that is my goto example
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre the next big thing youll seeyoull all seee irish man in
GetMotivated,not_removed,im serious though mostly joking with daddy but i really was looking forward to an answer i just said daddy because you said you wish your dad taught you lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,who were these enigmatic whites
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think that life is fair the universe is not neutral toward humans the universe is also not neutral toward tuna fish kind of how lightening is not neutral with respect to what it hits though it has no mindcaringdecision making it simply has a path it follows
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha compound interest lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,now walk on these hot coals and burn your feet
GetMotivated,not_removed,this annoys me this and that saying the definition of insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results have these people never heard that practice makes perfect
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would rephrase your question to how do i limit my disappointments ambition is not a problem as long it it doesnt hurt others it is not at unsustainable level ie you are not demanding more than you can produce easy way into depression the biggest thing for me when it comes to limiting disappointments was realizing that most stuff doesnt really matter you are so probably you see lots of things as life changing but they truly arent as long as you can make yourself do well in school and get yourself to good university everything else should fall in place now back to they way your body looks its mostly consistently working out nutrition everything else most people think that youll look great by lifting xxx kgslbs of weights and ever increasing it unless you are finding some satisfaction in bragging like i bench press xxx its actually waste of focus too much on amounts you lift dont believe me take a look at in you can see her starting to lifting weights and if you pay attention to amounts youll see they are laughable she is great example what consistency and nutrition does over time naturally you can only gain about httpwwwbodybuildingcomfunasktherippeddudehowmuchmusclecaniputonnaturallyhtml so focus on consistently going to gym and nutrition there are lots of great youtube videos on that if you would like me to expand respond on comment and ill try to answer more questions you have
GetMotivated,not_removed,if youre looking to improve your muscle then i suggest that you try different things to find out what works for you you obviously cant just go start out at deadlift so when you go to the gym or workout at home start out at a reasonable rate that you can handle and day by dayweek by week steadily increase it from there you dont have to just take it from me either go search things out for yourself and try what works for you only you will know what works for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre young and for many youth is a time of excess in all you do improving your body at this time in life will serve you well for as long as you live for your other goals find some volunteer organisations these places are dying for young volunteers you will learn some skills and very likely acquire a local mentor to help you along in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,be comfortable being awkward were humans no matter how much of a badass you are sometimes youre in an awkward position so it never goes away completely
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you very much for your comprehensive response i really appreciate it i have come to the conclusion of that its not just the way my body looks or it is really i mentioned my bmi is in the safe green zone however im not satisfied with the way fat is divided over my body im starting to get biceps that are noticeable if i flex the muscle but really for me its about losing stomach fat and then gaining muscle as its physically impossible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time i hope this makes sense but about motivation i think i need to alter some people around me ive also just started looking for work so that i can get some money whilst gaining experience for the future
GetMotivated,not_removed,this has just been a terrible week for me my girlfriend left the country for a month to work overseas and im literally just eating junk food all day studying less than i should and just having a problem defining my direction in general im even at work right now browsing reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,i lost my job had my birthday and lost my dad in a day span in april i fell into a horrible depression i refused to leave the house to even look for a job and was on the verge of losing everything out of nowhere the last week of june a company pulled my resume off a job board and called me in they immediately hired me its a small start up with very few employees a decent salary and great job culture it helped lift me out of my depression and get me motivated again and to think i almost didnt go to the interview
GetMotivated,not_removed,been keto for a week went to the gym twice this week ran there from work ive got some sexy biceps forming
GetMotivated,not_removed,months of diet and excercise i was drinking beer everyday and eating fast food something in my head clicked and i decided to cut the bullshit i bought an old weight bench and rusty weights off craigslist for and got to work
GetMotivated,not_removed,i will launch a blog projekt and everything is working till now
GetMotivated,not_removed,deleted all games from my ipad and hope i focus more on school

GetMotivated,not_removed,what does a successful look like to you if you dont know the answer your first step is to set some goals check out the wiki for some worksheets
GetMotivated,not_removed,successful people dont just think a day in advance a week in advance a month or a year in advance they do that too but they think what they want years in advance think about what you want years from now and that should help you reading the bible helps you by getting your mind set its not about religion its about transforming your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,figure out what small habits you need to establish and start establishing them now
GetMotivated,not_removed,great advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wish i could tell you im in a predicament not necessarily like yours but its difficult finding what truly makes you happy the best thing you could do is write down what you want in life evaluate your options and make decisions on what you want to do remember to control life dont let it control you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am not sure how much will help you but it details the life of a hobo but i wouldnt recommend it for inspiration since it is not such a story it is also a movie so you can watch that
GetMotivated,not_removed,start journaling every day just write whats on your mind let your thoughts flow
GetMotivated,not_removed,why dont you start a vlog about finding your passion and every week you can touch upon all the stuff that you like to do backpackinghiking flyfishing ect ive always found that helping others helps me to find an answer in your case others would be following you on your journey doing things you love while you find your passion im currently rereading invincible thinking

GetMotivated,not_removed,i guess its going alright i got very lucky in life and have parents who have pushed me through university and now i work for my father at a fintech company at i dont really have this figured out i have some passions like motorcycling and cycling but they dont bleed into my work life my job is engaging but the social politics can be stressful i recently broke up with a woman i really loved which threw my game plan out the window what goals do i have other than making money idk fitness love etc but i dont really feel them i never seem to follow that voice that tells me what i should do i just exist and keep existing generally i try to contribute be fit and socialize but after working a bit when im tired or hungry its too easy to get distracted i often feel like i should and could have acted differnetly done more been better but i dont see to ever catch up with my own expectation of who i should be i should excerise more i enjoy my life more when i do
GetMotivated,not_removed,started the year going to rehab for days moved into a halfwayhouse until i saved enough cash from the temp agency and now im moved with my coworker and his wife and their four kitties i felt really odd litterally moving into to their lives but im the only one to cook and their kitties already love me nc
GetMotivated,not_removed,good reminder to take stock we all have so many goals and todos it is helpful to look back and list what did get done so far this year get a little confidence that much can get done in the last quarter too
GetMotivated,not_removed,days to start a new habit welli guess ill start next year
GetMotivated,not_removed,my university stuff has been going very well so far now that im in a program i actually enjoy im having mostly good marks and a reason to get shit done and then there is martial arts looking back i feel like my mindset is what has changed most during this year i dont get frustrated over loosing a bout anymore and im making progress at points i was stuck before i also have goals now that motivate me to put in more effort the days will be used for starting strength training slow mo drilling and getting my footwork straight edit spelling
GetMotivated,not_removed,started the year heavier than ive ever been stuck on the bench at work sap consultant no projects were sold so no roles to staff me i took a leap of faith interviewed with a big firm got hired was offered a salary higher than where i was in now im a team lead on a multiyear deal in philly ive lost pounds should have lost more and im really happy learning to juggle the work stress with my personal goals and learning to put myself first im able to put work away when its time and also get in the zone when its crunch time and the client needs my team and i to deliver for the remaining days i want to get down into onederland weightwise and just truly end the year looking back and feeling proud of myself every year usually ends with such disappointment in myself for not doing xyz well this year i learned how to be patient consistent progress gets you much further than spurts of progress and i can actually look back and be proud of financially and physically getting healthier
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats youve done tremendously difficult things and i hope youll accept an im proud of you from an internet stranger because i am
GetMotivated,not_removed,i need to get into this mess with me and face my army of dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,well this is so motivating because when i look at all those dogs are all healthy and not skinny when some people cant manage to cope up with a single dog and she sell scraps to feed them you can read her story by the barcroft tv here httpwwwbarcrofttvnewdelhidogladyfeedsnurseshundredsstraydogsindia here is the official fundraiser where you can support her

GetMotivated,not_removed,if that is not a life fulfilled i do not know what is
GetMotivated,not_removed,beautiful women no other people just dogs just happy there are lots of people that need to know the easy way no things so much for you to get
GetMotivated,not_removed,indian here im a dog too
GetMotivated,not_removed,it seems like any good thing that india does people have the need to downplay it poverty is a separate issue that is getting dealt with everyday and if you only bring it up to undermine something good youre not actually helping anybody this woman shes helping
GetMotivated,not_removed,this all sounds right until you read a news that kid was killed by herd of stray dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,as an indian who has seen the way street dogs are treated this really warms my heart i live in australia and when ever i go to visit relatives in india i always sneak out feeding the nearby dogs who are not cared for by anyone and have to survive by licking up the remains of food people leave on plastic plates thrown on the street i really wish more people like her existed because even if people care and feel bad for them indian people have a its their problem not ours attitude i really wish this woman as much luck as i can
GetMotivated,not_removed,real patriarchy i was married at the age of to a man who was more than years older than me my husband often came home drunk and used to beat me fucking heartbreaking

GetMotivated,not_removed,good boys
GetMotivated,not_removed,i used to work at a place that had stray cats eveywhere i just thought it was weird that it had cats all over the place turns out the cleaner was feeding them hence all the cats this isnt an indian woman feeding stray dogs this is an indian woman causing dogs to hang around her by feeding them hell it probably started out as dogs but she feeds and they fuck bam dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was posted yesterday with the exact same title
GetMotivated,not_removed,good job she is inspiration to us so never stop keep moving
GetMotivated,not_removed,god or whatever you call him bless this woman
GetMotivated,not_removed,the question is would she be open for international adoptions if she can meet an adoption organization she could help bring that number down to a more manageable size
GetMotivated,not_removed,she is beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,god i love dogs i just want every dog in the world to be happy
GetMotivated,not_removed,she sells scrap for her dogs her living is fine i like how op tried to make a sob title out of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,get motivated feed some dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,she said i feel happy to live with them when i was with my husband i wasnt happy i used to work all day and run the house my husband didnt work typical indian women are responsible as shit and their lazy ass husbands can be relied upon to get drunk and waste money
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is amazing of her i must say i do have a concern though wheres the poop poops a dayminimum
GetMotivated,not_removed,if they not being fixed shes not really doing anyone any favors
GetMotivated,not_removed,old lady gibson is that you google it if you dont get the reference
GetMotivated,not_removed,the woman lives in a fucking shack and has less trouble feeding herself than i do
GetMotivated,not_removed,some of my coworkers from india are scared to death of dogs because growing up they literally ran for their lives home from school due to all the packs of wild dogs that established territories in the neighborhood
GetMotivated,not_removed,this woman may literally a menace to society in india around people often children die from rabies every year due to dog bites the number in the us is a year almost always from bats i doubt these stray dogs are vaccinated if she can barely afford to feed them and i am sure that every once and awhile one gets rabies and bites some poor person who cant afford treatment and then dies a slow miserable death unless they are vaccinated then good on her i suppose i love dogs but this is a third world country with more pressing issues related to public health
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats likeher own choice man
GetMotivated,not_removed,definitely getting high on their own supply
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly this kind of life must be kind of cool better than normal life
GetMotivated,not_removed,around how much would of milk of rice and of meat chicken cost in india
GetMotivated,not_removed,first you get the dogs then you get the power then you get the women
GetMotivated,not_removed,til in america we have cat ladies and in india dog ladies are a thing 😮
GetMotivated,not_removed,we need her over at rmagictcg ulrich sucks
GetMotivated,not_removed,dogs lay at your feet edie
GetMotivated,not_removed,the definition of blessed
GetMotivated,not_removed,seems she has a lot of dog meat and leather potential
GetMotivated,not_removed,can confirm this have seen her many times my home is close to this place and its a big marketplace i used to go there every day with friends and i know some of these dogs too im now in a different country for university but i miss all of it so badly
GetMotivated,not_removed,so who does poop cleaning duty
GetMotivated,not_removed,so many doges ive never seen anyone so wealthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i heard that lisa vanderpump does a lot of stuff to help stray dogs can someone please share this article on her twitter account may be this year old brave lady gets some funding
GetMotivated,not_removed,wasnt this post deleted because they said it didnt belong here this story isnt real no way is she selling shit out on the street and feeding herself and dogs complete bullshit
GetMotivated,not_removed,the most protected woman in india
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wonder how quickly her dog population is growing thats a lot of dogs in a small place would be bad if she was no longer able to support the dogs and there is suddenly significantly more strays than before she started
GetMotivated,not_removed,on some real shit you fuckin go sweetheart life without purpose isnt much of a life at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,married at the age of seven theres just something so innately fucked up about that
GetMotivated,not_removed,noble workafter her death they will feel whom they lost
GetMotivated,not_removed,article says she can barely feed herself but shes fat
GetMotivated,not_removed,and here i am with a regular job about to be late with rent guess i need several hundred more dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was on the front page from a different subreddit less than days ago
GetMotivated,not_removed,bubbles
GetMotivated,not_removed,no silly thats old lady gibson
GetMotivated,not_removed,crowdfunding page
GetMotivated,not_removed,ill bet shes happier than me
GetMotivated,not_removed,no one is fucking with that lady
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope im not crying its just something that got in my eyes ok im crying this is so damn cool and and and
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a saint
GetMotivated,not_removed,either she has a lot of money or those dogs are dying of starvation
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpfalloutwikiacomwikioldladygibson is that you
GetMotivated,not_removed,she must be a really good salesperson get that lady over here selling houses she could probably take over the world with the amount of dawgs in her dog army then may god bless and protect this lady
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wonder where all my comrades at rlatestagecapitalism are
GetMotivated,not_removed,but yall want at mcd
GetMotivated,not_removed,dog soup dog chili chili dogs dog tacos dogloaf just saying
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sure her neighbors love her she is aggravating a bad problem
GetMotivated,not_removed,this doesnot seem to be the full story she nurses and feed dogs is that not a fulltimejob and she sells scraps to financially support this even if she coud earn enough then when does she even find the time to do so this is a scam and im just not sure to what extend if the woman does indeed exist and is fulltime caring for those dogs as a job and is payed this then she still would still be a great person however if would be a wrong presentation then anyways as shady as it is presented it might as well be made up completely even if it was more plausible little fotoshooting fast dollars happened before and is probably the case here who can you trust these days even if you support well known and trusted ngos i gotta tell you they flush your money down the toilet overpaying everyone not just own personal to gains but even outsourced contracts to regular companies
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont understand this is so dumb this just looks like dogs hanging around for food and sex shes gonna get mauled by a starving pack some day need to stop them breeding like cattle damn
GetMotivated,not_removed,clearly quite overweight barely able to feed herself
GetMotivated,not_removed,so motivating until the next post crazy lady died and eaten by stray dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry and not to downplay her achievements but there are so many starving children in india that desperately need enough food clean water and shelter that seeing images like this breaks my heart its like people in the west care more about animal life than human life and through absolutely zero fault of her own other people just absolutely neglectignore abandoned or impoverished children i really cant help but think what joy it would bring to a childs life if the food and resources she scrounged went to them instead of a horde of stray dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,repost
GetMotivated,not_removed,how many times will this get reposted
GetMotivated,not_removed,omg think about the smell
GetMotivated,not_removed,she should sell dogs for a living shes got plenty of them
GetMotivated,not_removed,there were dogs yesterday but unfortunately not enough scrap metal was sold
GetMotivated,not_removed,this thing is so wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,shes cooking the cats to make more cat food then making more kittens
GetMotivated,not_removed,the scraps she sells are the leftovers from the stray dog fights
GetMotivated,not_removed,dogs fed how many children left to starve
GetMotivated,not_removed,the real motivation here is to work yourself to death because why not
GetMotivated,not_removed,when the time comes that she dies those dogs will probably eat her corpse
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok ramsay bolton
GetMotivated,not_removed,shit i can barely handle the pup i have now idk how she has time to make money and still make sure all dogs get proper care attention and exercise and that food has got to be so expensive i wonder how many lbs of it she goes through per day
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd never go without meat its not cannibalism dont judge
GetMotivated,not_removed,free dinner for a month said the asian
GetMotivated,not_removed,sickening
GetMotivated,not_removed,i must have missed it where did you see that
GetMotivated,not_removed,im going to be antithetical if a system is in a steady state an injection of energy can throw it out of wack the system may run better or more productive for sometime but it will become dependent on the continuous stream of external energy the problem is if the external source of energy dissipates the entire system can be destroyed resources which were spent to maintain the system are now being spent towards obtaining the higherunnatural energy state just appreciate itthats my opinion
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the real question is are you a slumdog
GetMotivated,not_removed,this woman shes helping helping supply the slums with more and more feral dogs maybe what shes doing is not a good thing were she having them neutered and then feeding them i might disagree but shes just perpetuating a problem
GetMotivated,not_removed,because if she wasnt feeding them stray dogs in india wouldnt exist also seems to me that a hungry dog is more desperate than one with a full belly
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry but from what i have seen not true at all in fact most places i have been to have small shops and houses adapt their own street dog and care for them the bigger cities though yes in many cases the dogs fend for themselves
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry but thats just not true
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is pretty normal in indiadomestic violence has become an issue only the previous decademost of the indian women are expected to treat their husband like godspati devo bhaboeven if they beat them daily
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats the context was he throwing her a backhand occasionally because she kept bringing home dogs i hardly think a crazy dog lady is the best source for unbiased news
GetMotivated,not_removed,its weird because its like you think the animals materialize if food is there they come because they were starving somewhere else much like a refugee camp doesnt spawn starving people its where starving people go when they need help
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah stray animals arent exactly a good situation for several reasons they need to be spayed and neutered or else this womans good deed is just drastically growing the stray dog population and then what will happen to them when she dies this doesnt sound very heartwarming to me speaking of which that place is probably heartworm city
GetMotivated,not_removed,and its new to plenty of us myself included
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know how it is where you live but selling scraps is not the most lucrative job in the world
GetMotivated,not_removed,why just indian it is common across the globe some more than others
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre smart she probably doesnt feed the ones that fight plus they all get enough
GetMotivated,not_removed,on your face
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh stfu
GetMotivated,not_removed,i tentatively agree dont know much about this subject but this is a motivationfocused subreddit and there is quite a bit that many of us can learn about her dedication and perseverance despite her environment providing her limited opportunities in the interest of motivating others who come to this subreddit for motivation we can at least try to frame it in that way
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats empathy she does not possess skills or authority to solve the situation with the stray dogs but she is doing her very best in helping them at least her heart is in the right place because of her efforts dogs get to live comfortably and are loved that is a big gain for humanity
GetMotivated,not_removed,its sad but true the problem is that everyone is looking at this with a privileged point of view because they likely did not grow up in a literal slum infested with fleas and diseases where packs of dogs are a serious problem so they see something like this and think its a heartwarming story and all these pups are being taken care of the reality is that shes creating far worse of a situation for these dogs they will thrive multiply roam in packs through the streets more than ever before and then meet a much worse fate once this old lady kicks it because then theyll be five times as many stray dogs suddenly not being fed i just feel that its irresponsible to look at this as an encouraging motivating thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do you know theyre not desexed
GetMotivated,not_removed,around ₹
GetMotivated,not_removed,this already showed up there yesterday
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree the organizer for the event when i clicked it was weird just didnt look right
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had the same thought on the original submission and also got down voted considering the original didnt hit the front page and this was posted quickly after i would bet there is going to be an effort to raise money for her
GetMotivated,not_removed,i said the exact same things on the original post and everyone kept downvoting me this is definitely a fraud
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not like that its the inherited body structure and also their skin would obviously become like that with that age and the things she has been through personally i consider your comment rude
GetMotivated,not_removed,gf works at a vet a clinic can confirm guy found dead in trailer with dogs sometime after his death they ate plenty of him not exactly a lot of options dogs are recovering from severe dehydration without eating the guy a lot of them would probably be dead
GetMotivated,not_removed,i bet shed prefer her body help the dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,you make feeding stray dogs seem like a bad thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,if that food when to starving kids in africa theyd just grow up and create more starving kids in africa no thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,ew get your high horse attitude out of here she can do whatever makes her happy like the rest of the goddamn world if it breaks your heart donate to nonprofits instead of sitting behind your expensive computer when theres starving children jesus let people live fam
GetMotivated,not_removed,the dogs unlike a horde of starving kids provide protection as well as companionship hello abusive husbandother jerks glad to see you are in town meet my pack of devoted dogs i think this is pretty smart of her frankly not a lot of other solid protection options to poor elderly poor women shes carved out a nice safe niche
GetMotivated,not_removed,those kids probably come from a different caste though so shed prefer they starve and she feed the dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,which they deleted and said didnt belong here
GetMotivated,not_removed,that could probably make more stray dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,what the fuck are you doing to help
GetMotivated,not_removed,they should eat the dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,y so selfish the children could have eaten those dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,our teeth are sharp
GetMotivated,not_removed,a lot everyday pratima buys kgs of rice and five kgs of meat for their lunch she feeds them with litres of milk for their breakfast so at least kgs of food per day she must raise a good amount of money x i hope she at least neutersspays the dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,rlatestagecapitalism
GetMotivated,not_removed,indian here shes doing what she can alone at that age trust me animals specially street dogs arent treated well there are no animal shelters out here like western countries most of the time they starve and are beaten and trust me many people in india dont give a rats ass about animals they are some objects causing menance for them also lemme tell you this has nothing to do with starving kids in india thats a completely different issue edit recently there was a case of a man throwing a dog from his terrace just for likes and views for a silly youtube video
GetMotivated,not_removed,you sounds s like someone who gives a lot to our species tell us of all the good you do
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol what have you done to look out for your own species then stray dogs in india are typically malnourished and riddled with diseases and yet all her dogs look healthy and happy shes done a great thing why do you have to be such a dick about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,he lives up to his username and stupid
GetMotivated,not_removed,unlike the people who have been in her life the dogs provide her with loving companionship and protection from harm out of those dogs im betting some of them would take a bite out of an abusive husband who happens to be in town frankly this seems like a smart way to have companionship and safety as well as do some good she certainly views her life as better and given what it was like before i frankly agree of course she worries about the dogs after she is gonethey are her actual support group and family her protectors
GetMotivated,not_removed,a child of lucifer telling me to look out for other humans before anything else wtf
GetMotivated,not_removed,some parts of india have large stray dog populations that pose problems to society i was living in a little farming village up in himachal and the locals told me once a year they round up a lot of strays and shoot them for population control over the the course of six months a couple travelers i was living with got bitten by strays and had to seek medical attention and get treated for a possible rabies infection during some nights i was afraid to leave my front door to walk to the outhouse because i could hear packs of dogs fighting viciously right outside my room so i resorted to using plastic bottles to relieve myself once a pack of stray dogs attempted to attack me while being cyclerickshawed in some dark alleys in the middle of the night it was scary as fuck and in certain places when a cow dies they quickly cremate it because i was told that stray dogs would eventually eat the carcass and develop a taste for cow flesh in varanasi one of the craziest stories ive heard about the cremation ghat was from a guy who witnessed a stray dog pull a human foot from a pyre and run off into the alleys india definitely has a different situation with dogs compared to here in america
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have one advise for you in life whenever you come across anyone doing anything good please do not be cynical about it and discourage them as it is we have very few people doing good things and comments like yours is the last thing we need
GetMotivated,not_removed,plz get off the internet
GetMotivated,not_removed,username checks out
GetMotivated,not_removed,yo the century called it wants its logic back
GetMotivated,not_removed,omfg you and your whole family suck dicks
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what the dogs are for
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont hate indian kids but i like animals better than indian kids
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you get married at young age in india in the past marriage is just a ceremony social contract for future plan you dont live with your husband until you are in teens now it is illegal to get married under of age for girlswomen
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey woah just because its alien to you doesnt make it sickening if you think that of their culture what the fuck would you make of actual aliens no wonder they dont come down to visit humans are fuckin squares
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey aisha was married at doesnt mean she got porked necessarily
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the article at the part where she said married at
GetMotivated,not_removed,will this money really go to her
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,what did you major in applications of pseudophysics in giving meaningless unsolicited advice to strangers on the internet just appreciate it all that acid isnt good for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i get what your saying the best thing to do would probably take the donations and put it in an investment portfolio and use it as a steady flow of income that way she doesnt think she can take care of dogs then the donations stop and shes fucked i doubt she has the money management skills to do this but who cares if she gets all this money and buys upgrades for the facility thats great also
GetMotivated,not_removed,high quality comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,nahslumdog trillionarie
GetMotivated,not_removed,not many people desex dogs considering the cost and not wanting to hurt animals here in india slum aunties are uneducated and innocent about any consequences here she just want to feed the dogs because her heart said that poor is always the kindest human being
GetMotivated,not_removed,the abc program is the duty of the state government blame the state government for not doing their duty instead of people like her who are helping out the dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe shell use the money and extra attention to get some of them spayed and neutered
GetMotivated,not_removed,how long have you been there i live in india and there are a lot of strays here which are uncared for tbh india has other problems as well rampant poverty for one so the apathy may not be surprising but to say that there isnt a stray problem in india is a downright lie
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly mumbai delhi
GetMotivated,not_removed,which part the dogs seemed pretty generally ignored every time ive been there and most people seem to not care
GetMotivated,not_removed,in which context do you believe it to be acceptable that year old child is married to an adult who gets drunk and beats her
GetMotivated,not_removed,feeding starving unfixed dogs produces more dogs either fix and feed or dont feed at all if you feed and dont fix the population will grow until you cant feed them anymore then more hungry feral dogs
GetMotivated,not_removed,majority of people subscribed to this subreddit saw this in their all feed to see it again the next day is not very refreshing content at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,dunno why ur getting downvoted
GetMotivated,not_removed,got it thanks for clearing that up for me
GetMotivated,not_removed,interesting that you guys are perfectly content to ignore this seeing as reddit is so adamant about dogs and cats in developed areas being spayed and neutered in order to get rid of the stray population those dogs have no medical care no guards against heartworm disease or fleas which will spread to any nearby human residences and they will reproduce much faster if theyre being well fed and congregating in one area what do you think is going to happen to all those dogs when she dies if theyre not being spayed or neutered shes just growing the population to create even more suffering animals when shes no longer around if this were in america the community here would be criticizing her for not thinking about the longterm welfare of those animals or the environment around them the double standards here are crazy
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont feed the ducks
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cant inherent more calories than you burn off im not here to diss this woman but she clearly feeds herself very well
GetMotivated,not_removed,ahahahahahahhaa
GetMotivated,not_removed,plus hes dead if i die and the only option my pets have for survival is to eat me hell eat away im gonebuffets open
GetMotivated,not_removed,well it pretty much is its like feeding subway rats
GetMotivated,not_removed,as long as you dont get annoyed when you see people litter let people live fam
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha pretty much true
GetMotivated,not_removed,win win
GetMotivated,not_removed,redditsilver
GetMotivated,not_removed,i keep my charity money within my own country to help our own people stray dogs dont need the food more than children
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha maybe thats how she ended up with
GetMotivated,not_removed,what does anything in this thread have to do with capitalism
GetMotivated,not_removed,came here to say this no year old woman should be selling scraps for a living
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah postapocalyptic india is a great example of capitalism generally being bad where do i sign for full marxism
GetMotivated,not_removed,indian here can confirm about the general state of stray dogs in our country cant confirm about the youtube douche though
GetMotivated,not_removed,indian here can confirm this
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive actively volunteered since the grade my school required students to volunteer for community service hourssemseter i still volunteer did i win the pissing contest are more important than dogs our society has gotten fd up along the way youll step over a homeless person lying in the street but get down on your hands and knees in filth to help an animal priorities are screwed up
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not continue reading
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you have a basic understanding of the english language or do you speak merican can you conjugate verbs or write complete sentences most year olds can but an adult can not this is worrisome dude you lives up to your username as well good job buddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,the road to hell is paved
GetMotivated,not_removed,why only upvotes they dont like reason i suppose
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope your profile days old gtfo do you have an opinion or just follow the herd moo moo mmooo muthafucka
GetMotivated,not_removed,really you are proving my argument for me thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,until you remember the elephant and mouse story and so many other examples and realize just how much bullshit that is
GetMotivated,not_removed,in certain cultures its ok to rape in others it was ok to murder the system of forcing children into arranged marriages is disgusting just because its in cultures doesnt make it any less disgusting we think rape and murder is disgusting please calm your fucking tits
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah how dare i find forced child marriages disgusting do you even hear yourself youre defending years olds getting married off and potentially raped if aliens would avoid anything it would be people like you who think this sort of thing is ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,sex is only part of the problem with child marriage
GetMotivated,not_removed,whose aisha
GetMotivated,not_removed,she got the d at married at
GetMotivated,not_removed,the creator of the fundraiser is an organization called straw stray relief and animal welfare it says theyre verified by paypal a quick google search and a look at their facebook page shows that they seem to be a legit organization located in india and that they do some pretty great work with local education and animal welfare so even if the money doesnt go to her i think it probably will though its still going to an organization that does a lot of good
GetMotivated,not_removed,cynic me says i doubt it
GetMotivated,not_removed,phd in mental gymnastics thank you very much
GetMotivated,not_removed,math its cool you disagree with my statement but i wish you attacked the comment rather than washing it off because it is unconventional to see the relationship between economic value and an abstraction of matter moving over distances new ideas are fluid they shape shift until theyre formalizedbut figuring we literally transact in petrocurrencies there is truth to the statement work in an economic sense is no different than work in physics but there is a different scalar representation for both j very rarely is a transfer of money not associated with a transfer of energy meaningless unsolicited advice to strangers on the internet just appreciate it all that acid isnt good for you are you ironically being ironic or unironically lacking selfawareness
GetMotivated,not_removed,sadly though many civic corporations do not have the money or manpower to deal with sterilisation once in a while usually in response to an out cry when the dogs bite a child they do mass culling but ngo s the media and people themselves protest and end it the result is status quo
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive lived in one of the major cities for all my life and every colony ive moved to has had people who take care of strays maybe a coincidence
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive lived in different cities in india and in all of them the dogs have been mostly healthy by my definition and always ready to play
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes im sure the two visits youve had to india provides you a better perspective than someone who actually lives there
GetMotivated,not_removed,ignore him hes just shitting on this thread blaming the dogs and the lady
GetMotivated,not_removed,either fix and feed or dont feed at all this is easy to say on the internet much harder when youre faced with a starving animal in real life
GetMotivated,not_removed,then skip over it not everyone scours reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,uh you did you said indian women
GetMotivated,not_removed,because india is a hindu region where islam is a minority religion except for the small part in kashmir and that basically most muslim majority countries have enforced alcohol prohibitions
GetMotivated,not_removed,i donno why youre being so downvoted youre the only one talking any sense here instead of just going yay doggies
GetMotivated,not_removed,also stray dogs in india kill a lot of humans through rabies upwards of a year its a staggering number considering we only lose people to rabies a year in the us
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you volunteering to kill them yourself or are you just being a dick on the internet
GetMotivated,not_removed,you see people have different body structures according to their regions its not calories too she has given births and in
GetMotivated,not_removed,nah dude calories are all genetic theyre all passed down from common ancestor who ate a shitton taco bell
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre not rodents or pests the dogs she took in were already strays she just made them healthier its not like there would be less stray dogs if she didnt take them in
GetMotivated,not_removed,not when they starve andor become feral and attack people
GetMotivated,not_removed,an indian here please look after the poor
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmm late stage capitalism appears to be a combination of socialism and capitalism as a remedy for the human rights issues that pure market capitalism doesnt address
GetMotivated,not_removed,rlatestagecapitalism is the new ratheism theyve got their ideology and they want everyone to know i tried subbing for a little while but they downvote the shit out of comments they dont like and thats never a good thing for open discussion and learning about stuff
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the usa where ive lived since many comfortable and privileged people are easily amused by endearing transcient peoples privileged peoples to include myself are happy to be amused by a unique homeless personand in some cases a special interest is taken in that specific empoverished person however as more talented endearing and unique people get discovered to be without resources to become click bait few people in influential positionslike teachers police immigration agents fast food chain general managers smalltime lawyers pipe fitters and real estate agentsfew people that can change this scenario ask what creates my love and interest in a woman living in a shack and feeding dogs and what also allows me to ignore that she lives in a shack in the city with the highest per capita income in her country
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah why am i following this you are all correct im wrong i see the error of my ways
GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure about how sarcastic youre being but capitalism in india is absolutely horrendous
GetMotivated,not_removed,they were medical college students who threw the dog from terrace and circulated in whatsapp for lulz sick bastards
GetMotivated,not_removed,so less than an hour a week why dont you do more obviously you dont care about people see how annoying that is for me to say that listen youre young and angsty which we all get but youve gotta realize pointing to a good deed and saying how something better could have been done really just makes you a shitty person and discourages people from doing something good in the first place the issues of the world arent because of messed up priorities on the part of those who would do good deeds in the first place its much moreso to do with the amount of people who simply do nothing at all if you really care about making the world a better place encourage any and all acts of kindness dont look down on them in judgement
GetMotivated,not_removed,why judge others let everyone do what they like as long as they dont infringe on your rights or hurt other people or harm the environment why preach not everyone has to have the same commitment as you
GetMotivated,not_removed,you sound like youre
GetMotivated,not_removed,homeless people can do so much to help themselves with their problems animals on the other hand cannot
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont like people as much as i like animals so i guess my priorities arent that screwed up
GetMotivated,not_removed,if youre looking for a good way to help out you can start by disconnecting from the internet
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is cringe worthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,and no being an ex mod of rspacedicks doesnt count as community service
GetMotivated,not_removed,i actually think youre looking at things clearly i agree about human priorities but its a nice story about a kind lady who they said prefers dogs to humans cant really blame her there considering we do step over our own destitute and cold
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had no problems understanding his comments meanwhile your comments seem like written by a molested child i cant understand your shitty logic at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,you must see the irony
GetMotivated,not_removed,look out for ur own species instead of dogs m glad not everyone thinks like you motherfucker
GetMotivated,not_removed,explain exactly how that is dumbass
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol you deleted your comment
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are speaking from an ideological or cultural bias there is nothing inherently wrong with the practice and you have no grounds to act like there is you can have a different opinion sure but to condemn it is an act of ignorance and is needlessly shit stirring
GetMotivated,not_removed,the prophet mohammeds piece
GetMotivated,not_removed,its cool you disagree with my statement but i wish you attacked the comment rather than washing it off because it is unconventional to see the relationship between economic value and an abstraction of matter moving over distances new ideas are fluid they shape shift until theyre formalizedbut figuring we literally transact in petrocurrencies there is truth to the statement i would have attacked your comment but it is a meaningless statement of the obvious sugarcoated with a heavy dose of pseudointellectualism case in point this one again and petrocurrencies what the fuck does that have to do with our discussion and no we dont literally transact in petrocurrencies not all currencies are considered petrocurrencies work in an economic sense is no different than work in physics but there is a different scalar representation for both j very rarely is a transfer of money not associated with a transfer of energy yawn please go to riamverysmart meaningless unsolicited advice to strangers on the internet just appreciate it all that acid isnt good for you are you ironically being ironic or unironically lacking selfawareness neither giving you some meaningful unsolicited advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not just a question of money its a question of will and this is something the state governments sorely lack it is stupidity on a grand scale even though its the duty of the state government the ngos are doing most of the sterilization and the politicians take turns to shit on the very ngos that are helping them out case in point the recent stray crisis in kerala what a shit show that was by the people and the state govt and finally randia as well jaipur has done it on a large scale why cant the same be done in other states as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,a few strays are usually fed by some of the families in the colonies but they are not exactly adopted or taken care of in any real sense they are usually fed leftovers and not all stray dogs live near residential areas many of them live close to landfills or slaughterhouses where no one takes care of them and they have to scavenge for food if all the dogs were properly taken care of by the people or the govt we wouldnt have a stray crisis
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure i agree i live in bangalore and while ive seen some dogs being fed ive yet to see any strays that are actually healthy and ready to play even dogs ive fed myself for months are never really friendly enough with me for me to pet them
GetMotivated,not_removed,who lives there and how would you know how many times ive been there i was asking for clarification from someone who disagreed with a post without any reason explanation or context i asked because i wanted to hear the disagreement in greater detail i didnt claim to be an expert or have a better perspective as you seem to think but i have been there and my experience more or less supports the first guy who explained his own experience adequately enough to justify a more detailed response you made baseless assumptions about both of us and jumped in just to call me wrong if you werent deliberately trolling please reflect on your goals in discourse and the quality of your input because its bad
GetMotivated,not_removed,then get the animal fixed the alternative will cause much more pain and suffering
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dint say only indian women if i said indian women are good in business im not saying all other woman are bad in business why are you so eager to assume the worst
GetMotivated,not_removed,i meant where women are treated like literal subhumans western women should be thankful
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont please explain only explanation is people see the word islam and are going ape
GetMotivated,not_removed,hes not being a dick stray dogs are a real problem in india and cause thousands of human deaths a year through rabies its hard to understand in a western country where we have a strong vaccination program but we only have cases of rabies a year and they have rabies is always fatal and a really terrible way to die so yeah id kill them myself if they cant be vaccinated and neutered otherwise shes putting both animals and humans in dire peril
GetMotivated,not_removed,so what is the body mass made of exactly how would one go to maintain this mass
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think the concern is if the dogs are healthy and not moving around to find new sources of food they will breed more and breed in a smaller pool of genetics risking other problems if they are spayed and neutered there is no problem but i seriously doubt they are
GetMotivated,not_removed,im far from marxist but i thought it referred to the concept that capitalism is in its final stage after which marxists assume we will enter some sort of socialist or communist utopia made possible by capitalism that has a lot more to do with the classic marxist concept of stages of history i dont know if that subreddit actually takes that concept seriously though this is reddit after all i could be explaining it wrong as well since i believe its all rubbish
GetMotivated,not_removed,most countries have a combination of socialism and capitalism there are no pure market capitalist economies currently in existence
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah i am a leftist but far left ideologies annoy me with their closed mindedness
GetMotivated,not_removed,well at least it didnt bring the country to the brink of default in the early that was nehruvian socialism
GetMotivated,not_removed,its sickening both as a dog owner and a human being
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was so happy when the news came out that they found the dog apparently shes doing well now im glad to hear it
GetMotivated,not_removed,absolutely disgusting
GetMotivated,not_removed,valid points i agree with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,look at his username hes an edgelord
GetMotivated,not_removed,valid point
GetMotivated,not_removed,im getting there
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you saying a molested child will have trouble writing coherently on account of being molested that seems pretty weird
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats why he wrote it confirmed
GetMotivated,not_removed,reread what youve written
GetMotivated,not_removed,atrocious and also pretentious and what exactly do you agree with when his comments dont really mean anything and are just a shameless exercise in pseudointellectual bullshittery
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol our government cant take care of our population taking care of strays is a far cry
GetMotivated,not_removed,the guy who you replied to obviously lives in india if he isnt talking out of his ass like someone else over here you disagreed with someone who has a better perspective of the situation and your argument to state the contrary was that things werent like that the few times you visited there which suggests to me that you find your select few experiences of more importance than someone elses which is a very juvenile attitude
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you start a sentence with typical and then point to one country it implies that it is typical with that country i was politely asking why you had to mention only one country when it is a common phenomenon across cultures and geographies adding the word only to your original sentence will make it worse but the lack of it wont make it right i didnt assume shit if any i asked politely and received an impolite response
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh well take your downvotes i was highlighting the positive qualities of these women not making a statement on gender equality which is admittedly terrible
GetMotivated,not_removed,you and the op were on one side of a controversial issue islam dog shit or not so much so obviously people will be there to disagree with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,right so youre saying this year old woman should kill starving dogs and youre not actually doing anything to help yourself got it standard internet comment im sure you also think eugenics is a great idea because million people in india are malnourished
GetMotivated,not_removed,just skinlike how obese people would get their skin loose after losing weight they dont additionally they wear lose clothing aged women in our country are really very tough tho
GetMotivated,not_removed,whether she would take them in or not they would still stay not spayed or neutered but at least theyre fed and happy in this condition its not perfect and i would much rather the dogs be spayed and neutered but its incredibly expensive in india especially for hundreds of dogs i dont think this woman is rich enough to afford that again i have the same concern but i definitely prefer this to the condition of other stray dogs in india
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not a utopian concept the building of a socialist state is far from the communist realization
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a nice sub but people are way too annoyingly communist
GetMotivated,not_removed,based on what my parents told me about the government while it was socialist yes it was pretty corrupt and not that well implemented a system but i dont think the current system is good either coming from an upperclass indian family the amount of greed and selfishness here is astonishing even within my immediate family we are worth millions of dollars yet we still pay our drivers and servants between a month which is considered decent here while the cost of living isnt as high as it is in the us this disparity shouldnt be acceptable
GetMotivated,not_removed,getting where
GetMotivated,not_removed,he was in a struggle snuggle with uncle tom
GetMotivated,not_removed,just that i agree that the best way to help her isnt to just give her cash but set up a fund that will provide a steady cash flow so that someone else can be paid to help the dogs after she dies instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,i bet youre a real bore at parties
GetMotivated,not_removed,than why would you say that its typical for the man to be a lazy dumbass
GetMotivated,not_removed,they can go smoke poles
GetMotivated,not_removed,india already puts down plenty of dogs to control rabies they cant afford to vaccinate them all no eugenics is not alright under any circumstances and saying that someone would support that because they want to control rabies is ridiculous i am not indian but she is and she is contributing to an problem in her own country and we as westerners are praising her for it while disregarding the damage that such behavior does to human and animal life what may be a worthy cause in the us isnt one in a place like india
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe its a sub for communism
GetMotivated,not_removed,hell
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you honestly think they dont know how to solve this problem in the end everything comes down to funds which world countries have little of and have to prioritize towards providing basic needs
GetMotivated,not_removed,not as long as theres some one like you in the party
GetMotivated,not_removed,cant you people leave my mildly imprecise and off color generalization in peace
GetMotivated,not_removed,were praising her for being compassionate towards needy animals if you want to suggest a campaign to help her neuter these animals ill donate put up or shut up
GetMotivated,not_removed,taking the highway
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you honestly think they dont know how to solve this problem yes in the end everything comes down to funds which world countries have little of and have to prioritize towards providing basic needs yes funds are required but there has been no state that has taken any meaningful action towards this india produces good quality antirabies vaccine which is the cheapest in the world even the rabies deaths that happen can be prevented but its not a big priority for the governments because the cases are isolated and not nearly as public sentimentappeasing as many other issues
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cant with women you shouldnt be able to with men
GetMotivated,not_removed,or you could donate towards animal control being able to vaccinate neuter or if needed put down those animals based upon the judgement of professionals who are chronically underresourced or is a feelgood story about saving strays more important to you than the lives of poor indians donate to something professional and yes i will match you this lady however well intentioned isnt a vet or animal control organization shes basically a hoarder without keeping the dogs caged and its not helping anyone httpwwwmissionrabiescom their work includes we trained and equipped some of the best dog catchers in the world to make sure we reached the crucial of the dog population to stop rabies spreading to dogs and people but that was just the beginning we set up permanent vaccination teams in goa and ranchi and embarked on intensive dog population control programmes in some of the toughest areas of the country our purposebuilt mobile veterinary hospital truck hosts monthly surgical training courses around india to teach vets the skills required to run neutering and vaccine campaigns we recruit volunteers for monthly mass vaccination drives at each location the truck visits further boosting the work of the established vaccination teams we distribute educational materials and visit schools to teach children and adults how to understand dogs better so they can avoid dog bites and reduce the risk of rabies

GetMotivated,not_removed,yes its obviously not life changing advice but stuff like this usually gives a lot of people a quick boost that helps get stuff started

GetMotivated,not_removed,indians will never forgive this guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,it makes sense when you are there trust me i went through a pretty bad depression for two years and just came finally out of it a year ago i tried to stay positive and searched for help therapy but those things dont get solved from one day to another when you barely can get out of bed and to work when you colapse in tears on the kitchen floor every day after coming home and closing your apartment door when all you can think about is how you would love to die so this hell could finally be over day after day after day trust me this mantra helps you a whole fucking lot in such a situation

GetMotivated,not_removed,here take this
GetMotivated,not_removed,does looking smart have anything to do with realizing that no one reading this can see how i look currently also creating carpet bombing is about as awesome as dropping nukes on a country that was ready to surrender weeks prior one of the great powers of the internet is its ability to completely ignore the global mindset that history is written by the victor
GetMotivated,not_removed,heil churchill and the pure blue bloods
GetMotivated,not_removed,read his biography no more thank you it was very interesting i must admit
GetMotivated,not_removed,except churchill never said that
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should do something about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,ready to surrender weeks prior no they werent japan and their largescaled concentration camps unit for example were still ready and running near the end of the fire balloon attacks on the us never stopped until while the balloons werent very effective the japanese didnt know that im not saying that japan was the most heinous country ever as every country did some seriously shitty things in the war the us dropped more bombs nonatomic in than the rest of the european allies combined for instance but the us didnt nuke japan just for the hell of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,confused is right
GetMotivated,not_removed,then create a faction for the british throne and then switch the nations religion to zoroastrian youll thank me later
GetMotivated,not_removed,whoever they did rip off
GetMotivated,not_removed,its important to really sit back and try to understand that whats taught in the us regarding military action is not what the rest of the world sees japan was ready to surrender at least two weeks prior but wanted the emperor to stay in power the us nuked japanese cities killing countless civilians and then accepting their surrender funny fact even after all of that the us still let the japanese emperor stay right where he was those bombs were dropped to show russia that the us had nuclear weapons truman i believe said as much he actually threatened nuclear war on at least separate occasions to other countries including russia in the months following those blasts now thats an interesting tidbit of info that clarifies to me what truman was really about if japan had indeed had enough concentration camps in war time operation to justify nuclear action then all the black sites the us operated and operates globally surely deserve some sort of action too unless youre saying that those largely ineffective fire bombs was the justification needed for nuking civilians there really was no benefit in dropping those bombs please understand that whats taught in us schools regarding military history is substantially different than what is seen and taught by the rest of the world where you were taught police action or liberation the rest of the world saw invasion and unfortunately more recently a history of botched invasions its not the fault of the populous its the leaders that are so scared and self conscious that they are willing to teach their own people to fight and die for words that no longer carry their intended meaning just look how fast the word hero turned into a generic commodity in the us before the internet there was a good chance that you could go your entire life without ever meeting someone that wasnt taught what you were now youd have to really work at it im not safe from the fire either my own prime minister praised castro for being an advocate of his loving people i guess killing of your fellow citizens is the act of a loving leader
GetMotivated,not_removed,characterinfo no more worries have a food new year
GetMotivated,not_removed,literally just a saying like saying whitney houston ripped off i will always love you because my grandparents said that before she did
GetMotivated,not_removed,dwhy do yoy assume im american im canadian im every aspect of the term just because i dont see japan as helpless victims in doesnt mean im some uberpatriotic american dont be so jumpy on the you silly incoherent brainwashed american train not to mention canada was pretty much the sole reason that uscuban relations have calmed as much as they have not neccesarily trudeau but regardless if canada went along villainizing castro like the us i highly doubt that cuban relations with the us would be what they are today not saying castro wasnt a bad guy but that i think canada made the right call
GetMotivated,not_removed,you too man its religion zoroastrian
GetMotivated,not_removed,we all love whitney houstan but ಠಠ
GetMotivated,not_removed,military targets are military targets no participant of war is innocent actively targeting civilians really takes the good guy part out of being the good guy which was my original point governments lying to their own people for selfish gains are global issues and not at all solely a us thing my wording could have been better yes but come on you spelled you yoy so trudeaus statement on castro left most people i know speechless he praised a mass murderer and turned his image into that of a sheltered and out of touch person with great hair tell you what next time i see you ill buy you a double double
GetMotivated,not_removed,hitting a man for a typo written on mobile is a low blow not to mention japans use of black death in chinese civillian areas and its plan to do the same for north america but yknow what do i know being a brainwashed sheltered american masquerading as a canadian trudeau was wrong about castro and his brother who managed to be even worse than fidel but id rather have someone who had a controversial family friend than a cheeto with a taste for grabbing women by their ladybits and i like my tims regular

GetMotivated,not_removed,victorias secret doesnt have enough poon for a second leonardo dont aspire to anything leo will get mad if he cant have a new one every week
GetMotivated,not_removed,successful people are not the best people to give life advice because you dont know if they actually followed that advice and if they were just lucky
GetMotivated,not_removed,why would anyone take advice from a movie star unless its how to win the acting lottery and become a movie star
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i was constantly dating models id have electric currents in my pants thanks leo
GetMotivated,not_removed,but hes an actor hes like paid to lie lmao
GetMotivated,not_removed,all you need is millions in your bank account like me lil leo no worries
GetMotivated,not_removed,i gotta admit if he did not win the oscars last year then i might not have taken this quote seriously
GetMotivated,not_removed,all you need is scented candles massage oil and barry white write that down look at me no cock pump van wilder no cock pump barry white taj haha shit always cracked me up
GetMotivated,not_removed,worry is paying interest on a debt you may not owe
GetMotivated,not_removed,write that down thomas shelby
GetMotivated,not_removed,in other words shanti deva from
GetMotivated,not_removed,anything is a dildo if youre brave enough abraham lincoln
GetMotivated,not_removed,worrying means you suffer twice newt scamander
GetMotivated,not_removed,i personally like being angry with someone is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die not sure where its from
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read that somewhere i wrote it down and then i read it
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats the difference between worrying and preparing
GetMotivated,not_removed,worrying is like a rocking chair it gives you something to do but it doesnt really get you anywhere write that down van wilder michael scott
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you rock hard enough you could get somewhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,writing
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks sb also please ld post so that people who are colour blind like myself can see the writing dark red on black is practically invisible to me your words will only reach a fraction of your audience regards
GetMotivated,not_removed,you said what we were all thinking
GetMotivated,not_removed,ur welcome
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you crazy every minute he takes to crop it out is a minute hes not making fake internet points
GetMotivated,not_removed,worrying wont make it any better
GetMotivated,not_removed,and redo all that awful text
GetMotivated,not_removed,its on a fucking black background literally just draw over it and its like it never was there
GetMotivated,not_removed,and crop the last three paragraphs out while youre at it they add nothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,may i ask why repels many reddit and users
GetMotivated,not_removed,while he may or may not have said this somebody else definitely wrote it out
GetMotivated,not_removed,why worry if you have done the best you can now im starting to believe that this is really from and they didnt stole the content from anywhere else
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes an oscar can be seen as an award for more than just a single performance or title for example when the return of the king won the oscar for best picture it was understood by pretty much everyone that the award was going to the entire trilogy and not just that single film
GetMotivated,not_removed,oscars are given for the best acting performance during that oscar season not for the best performance of the actors career
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree i think his performance in the departed was far and away better than the revenant better movie in general as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,well you need money to campaign for an oscar so a lot of it has to do with how much money is spent rather than a purely objectifed approach
GetMotivated,not_removed,awards nowadays arent given for the best acting but for the most acting which is problematic losinggaining weight or suffering through production like leo did does not a good actor make
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats because he was up against other actors not his other roles
GetMotivated,not_removed,not for nothing it was leos fault that the envelopes got mixed up at this years oscars he put down the best actress envelope on the pile and beatty picked it up thinking it was best picture the quote about never let failure take control of you is particularly ironic what about admitting you screwed up so you dont make someone else take the fall
GetMotivated,not_removed,the oscar came for his performance shitting on fort mcmurray and the oil sands after he was done filming
GetMotivated,not_removed,a successful handsome celebrity who got extremely lucky early on and rolled along with it gee thanks leo
GetMotivated,not_removed,have you tried not being ugly
GetMotivated,not_removed,some people say leonardo is handsome but i dont see it i cant really even tell which of the turtles is which
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed
GetMotivated,not_removed,he sure was born with that
GetMotivated,not_removed,aint that some shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,im fairly sure he didnt have those his whole life
GetMotivated,not_removed,count as digits right
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly i dont believe for a second that he said this himself i hate these unsourced image macros that have spread from grandpas facebook to every corner of the internet
GetMotivated,not_removed,no rich leos amphetamine induced tony robbinsing definitely applies to everyone
GetMotivated,not_removed,paid to be fake
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was going to say the same thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,not just you
GetMotivated,not_removed,didnt even read it it just looks awesome wish everything was like this
GetMotivated,not_removed,no seas resentido todos comenzaron por alguna pagina
GetMotivated,not_removed,relationships matter thats why he dates strings of interchangeable blonde models selected purely for their physical perfection problem with successful people doling out advice about success is that theyre selfselecting and youll never see the advice from the vast majority of people who worked harder were more deserving and still failed
GetMotivated,not_removed,his analogy is terrible the wrong connection will give you a shock the right one will light you on fire as you get electrocuted
GetMotivated,not_removed,i actually expected a turtle
GetMotivated,not_removed,its also off its different quotes every full stop is the end of that quote the last red part should have realtionships are like electric currents in red too
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,nobody does the best that they can disagree wholeheartedly a lot of people do their best daily i sure as fuck try to do my best at work every day because i like what i do and i need this job the thing is your best varies from day to day and hour to hour your best fully rested is not your best after days of long nights working
GetMotivated,not_removed,make sure to take relaxing breaks on your yacht to disconnect it will allow you to tackle your next challenge with more energy and focus
GetMotivated,not_removed,op described it as solid advice i find this to be a true claim i also feel that a contemporary success story is going to be much more effective in rgetmotivated for a lot of people
GetMotivated,not_removed,he does have an oscar though
GetMotivated,not_removed,what you want advice from unsuccessful people instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,he didnt win for acting he actually just put his body through a ton of shit and won an oscar for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i gotta admit anyone who takes winning an oscar seriously has got to reevaluate their life and priorities
GetMotivated,not_removed,van wilder is loosely based on bert at bertbertbertcom aka the machine
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is going on one of the many sticky notes i have on my desktop computer
GetMotivated,not_removed,right said fred
GetMotivated,not_removed,aright tommy arthur fucking shelby
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yes i remember this ❤
GetMotivated,not_removed,which one
GetMotivated,not_removed,grandpa
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont these usually come with the website url that made them
GetMotivated,not_removed,mvp
GetMotivated,not_removed,could literally just do it with snipping tool or ms paint
GetMotivated,not_removed,visit you will find all the information there
GetMotivated,not_removed,content is mostly reposts from other websites to make it worse they add their watermark any comment directing to the original is removed basically they steal memes
GetMotivated,not_removed,but master commander lost to return of the king in like categoriesstill cant get over it
GetMotivated,not_removed,this concept was establish back in the early ages of academy awards i believe the original reason was because of charlie chaplin iirc the academy didnt want it to become the charlie chaplin awards show so they made it known that the awards were essentially going to be spread out a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,but fellowship of the ring won best picture as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,is there anyway to block this motivation stuff from showing up on my news feed
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty sure no one honestly thought art carney was genuinely better than pacino in or even hoffman the same year one of the trades i forget which would do a piece every year or so with an anonymous academy voter where they would motivate how they would vote for performances because its just their time or movies they hadnt seen because i heard its amazing and i dont like the other lead contender or other incredibly inane reasons that had nothing to do with the quality of the film its all politics and bullshit honestly but with performances in general they tend to see these big young upcoming stars and hold off on rewarding them until later in life when its just their time in their defense richard dreyfuss was the youngest actor to win for leading role at the time at age and he said that fact fucked him up drove his ego through the roof and he wished he had gotten it later in his career on the flipside matt damon said winning an oscar at age was the best thing for him to put that awardmongering phase behind him and just be able to work
GetMotivated,not_removed,have you heard of an actor named daniel day lewis hes quite well known and has a habit of suffering through his productions
GetMotivated,not_removed,i couldnt disagree more
GetMotivated,not_removed,disagree method acting is modern acting get with the times
GetMotivated,not_removed,for men its about the career over the long run for women sadly you have to be in your twenties
GetMotivated,not_removed,is this the real explanation that nobody is talking about pricewaterhousecoopers is blaming their accountant saying in a statement released on their twitter page pwc takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last nights oscars pwc partner brian cullinan mistakenly handed the backup envelope for actress in a leading role instead of the envelope for best picture to presenters warren beatty and faye dunaway
GetMotivated,not_removed,and you know this how please source your awesome source of knowledge
GetMotivated,not_removed,i tell people to quit worrying about how ugly they are and just do what they do and love you can do what you love without having a girlfriend that naturally will lead to happiness and a great wellbeing which is exactly what people find attractive in the first place if you truly are an abomination though then work on your hair any ugly person can turn super attractive with hair that fits their face
GetMotivated,not_removed,it was just a joke mate ive been in a relationship for three years now i have a degree in math and a nice job still i hate when immensely successful people try and tell me that i just need to work hard and ill be successful some people get lucky some people dont despite hard work
GetMotivated,not_removed,ugly dudes can have ugly wives which is like so what
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if you are ugly and also have a crippling speech impediment
GetMotivated,not_removed,stop being jealous check blame your looks check
GetMotivated,not_removed,gilbert grape was the shit dont act like hes just been coasting on growing pains money for years or some nonsense
GetMotivated,not_removed,he is handsome but to say its luck is not fair you dont get acting talent like he has by having luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe you should stop blaming someone who worked hard to make it to the top on luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,why have i never thought of that
GetMotivated,not_removed,his dad has his own wikipedia page for accomplishments that arent being leos father i doubt he really ever wanted for much in his childhood and then he got his television breakthrough at probably wasnt born with loads of money but definitely had opportunities afforded to him that others dont get and im pretty sure you are born with looks
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah he was actually
GetMotivated,not_removed,aint that some shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,but he did get his first tv gig at so he has been successful for the vast majority of his life
GetMotivated,not_removed,more deserving by what metric
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok baby cool
GetMotivated,not_removed,i want advice from some hobbo that lives under a bridge
GetMotivated,not_removed,aka bert kreischer
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait the machine as in the man that makes me want to move to russia and join the mob
GetMotivated,not_removed,now all we need is some bait looks at scooby and shaggyfred
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been waiting for this joke ever since i learned his name kudos to you for fulfilling my dream
GetMotivated,not_removed,by order of the peaky blinders
GetMotivated,not_removed,idk pick the one that seems coolest
GetMotivated,not_removed,no it didnt
GetMotivated,not_removed,fellowship was nominated didnt win a beautiful mind won
GetMotivated,not_removed,no it didnt it lost to a beautiful mind source
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to merryl streep
GetMotivated,not_removed,out of best actress winners at the oscars have been or above
GetMotivated,not_removed,httplmgtfycomqdicapriobestactressenvelope
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah so a bald abomination can just go kill himself then d
GetMotivated,not_removed,well thats a lot of bs
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive had a girlfriend for three years now it was just a joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,true its not like leo is just some journeyman actor who is getting paid to do shit movies i love a lot of movies because of leo eg gangs of new york catch me if you can the revenant to name a few
GetMotivated,not_removed,people have limits man lots of people work just as hard as that guy and arent near as successful for every leo there are hundreds and thousands of have nots who worked just as hard i think people have a hard time accepting that
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe you should play the lottery if youre gonna think like that
GetMotivated,not_removed,the person that cleans the sewers works more hard than most same goes for construction workers why arent they at the top
GetMotivated,not_removed,remember once you make it you have to make it seem like hard work got you there otherwise the peasants might revolt
GetMotivated,not_removed,just being born is an incredible opportunity a million other sperms didnt get that opportunity money and looks arent much really
GetMotivated,not_removed,he couldve been washed up child star
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt realize he was at the time his character was around he was also in one episode of romper room at age
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes its his best funniest story got to hear him do it live in january but after multiple listens its actually a really scary story that he tells as humour to break the tension would not suggest joining russian mob
GetMotivated,not_removed,boi awwwdaaaah of vaaa poiiiiikey bloindaaahs ftfy
GetMotivated,not_removed,nominated lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks a lot
GetMotivated,not_removed,overrated
GetMotivated,not_removed,and this literally proves you wrong and makes you look even dumber than you wouldve if you just admitted dicaprio screwing this up was hearsay
GetMotivated,not_removed,just general advice for all the fuck uglies keep at it brother
GetMotivated,not_removed,i never said working hard is going to guarantee that you are going to be as successful but to blame someones success on luck seems like a cop out to not try your hardest
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cannot work hard to win the lottery thats a false equivalence
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not hard to understand that work in those field dont nearly pay the same for someone who is successful
GetMotivated,not_removed,because they made the wrong choices
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sure the kids starving in africa feel the same way
GetMotivated,not_removed,most people dont even have that opportunity
GetMotivated,not_removed,literally lol at this
GetMotivated,not_removed,its always hard for me to take anyone from such a wealthy background and successful at a young age seriously its not that i dislike him at all hes grown on me over the years but some people have real af problems that keep them up all night and a rich actors advice while meaning well just aint gone cut it playa
GetMotivated,not_removed,overrated or not it goes to show that women beyond their twenties are winning oscars
GetMotivated,not_removed,im balding and i cant grow a beard best i can do is a pedostache so i just shave d
GetMotivated,not_removed,what the hell man blame someones success on luck how narrow is the keyhole you view life through
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like decapriojust still trying to figure out reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,no need for a beard tbh just be a honestly nice person and youll be fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,luck and nepotism are the same thing nowadays right
GetMotivated,not_removed,× broheem
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty much get lucky and be born to the right people
GetMotivated,not_removed,why those who decided to join are making this country proud to all those who i know and to those who i have never even met
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wish i could offer advice but all i can tell you is youre not alone im in the same situation some days i get fed up and get productive but then i fall back into the same rut once that burst of motivation dies down hang in there and remind yourself that youve come this far you just have to push through to the end
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes a book will help you remove yourself from your situation then allow you to constructively reinsert yourself start with why by simon sinek was one i enjoyed awhile back im sure there will be lots of suggestions should you ask for them alternatively a good biography written about someone you admire tends to help inspire best of luck to you ive been there several times ultimately you need to find a way to push through it and rediscover your roots and your purpose
GetMotivated,not_removed,tasks that seem huge can best be tackled one small task at a time so go do one small task right now put on washing put books in a pile get off reddit and do a task anything right now now youre back on reddit repeat above continue until no tasks left if this stops working see dan pinkmans pinkcast about rule
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is golden advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,or even just write a paragraph sometimes the block is in the starting and once you get started youll just keep going
GetMotivated,not_removed,great fucking advice

GetMotivated,not_removed,for a second there i thought those dudes had balaclava on and this was a pic from an isis training center
GetMotivated,not_removed,giving to a task thats meant to fund my endeavors i deem worthy of
GetMotivated,not_removed,what am i doing making a considerable sum of money to surf reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,giving
GetMotivated,not_removed,pooping and being on reddit is not considered multitasking
GetMotivated,not_removed,enjoy it
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually getting paid to do it or working and surfing reddit instead of working
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like you
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont forget eating
GetMotivated,not_removed,or possibly httpwwwmapofukrainenetcrimeanpeninsulabalaklavaphotosbalaklavaharborjpg
GetMotivated,not_removed,badass just chilling like that
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,looks like this is aimed at being an allinone self improvement tool for people who want to set some goals and also find a coach or mentor to get them there its got some qa aspects and articles as well i dont see any pricing so im guessing at the moment its free landing page explains a good bit of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,cool signed up and has some pretty solid goal setting functions milestones subgoals etc looking forward to checking it out further
GetMotivated,not_removed,im guilty of this the problem is that occasionally people post advice that is good for specific situations but terrible without the right context ive found inspiration here so i dont think you should discount this sub entirely however i agree that the reddit stink face is real read the posts and comments if they speak to you remember them if not ignore them
GetMotivated,not_removed,the problem is people confusing confort with motivation a challenge is motivation a hug is confort
GetMotivated,not_removed,start small say today ill skip x and do x instead like take a walk or go sit on a park bench with a good book swing do something anything differently instead of going out with friends stare at yourself in the mirror and work on your body language and self esteem it feels so stupid at first but after a while youll see changes in your daily life then start two days a week then three then all seven then get involved with something worthwhile volunteer at your sisters school just be around different people or a different environment doing something that benefits others and makes you feel great these look great on your resume or college app if you ever decide to go that route an added bonus is the more people you know the more potential opportunities open up for you make the first thing you do when you wake up a small form of exercise not only is it healthy it wakes up your brain releasing feel good endorphins to start your morning right ten pushups jumping jacks anything go to bed earlier and wake up earlier youre not going to change yourself and fill up that hole over night youre not even going to do it in a week but nothing happens if you do nothing dont feel bad you skipped a day dont feel bad you skipped all previous days before take this advice and alter it to fit your life youre always going to be in the same hole if you keep doing the same things its one day or its day one
GetMotivated,not_removed,at the mere age of you must not forget that you still have your whole life in front of you good luck 🍀
GetMotivated,not_removed,start getting up earlier theres so much that can be accomplished earlier in the day start reading a booklearning new skills picking up a language this is great for some call centres that pay the extra bucks volunteer work also looks great on a cv it shows a good work ethic volunteering for a couple of hours a day wont cost you anything start doing a little exercise walk a bit cycle a bit do some pushups small things lead to the small things there wont be a massive sudden shift in your life unless you make small changes
GetMotivated,not_removed,go to work limit your time on video games and tv shows
GetMotivated,not_removed,read the defining decade why your twenties matter and how to make the most of them now by meg jay
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not quite sure how to begin digging myself out of this hole i will tell you the answer but you will not believe it yet when you wake up make your bed thats it nothing more just make your bed before you do anything else but obviously if you need to pee pee first every day and dont go messing it up before its time for bed again make sure future you has a nicelymade bed to go to sleep in he or she deserves at least that much respect besides even the messiest room is somehow redeemed by a nicelymade bed deal
GetMotivated,not_removed,my first thought was you need to be doing something with your day why no job if employment is bad where you are do you have familyfriends in an area with better employment would they give you a roof in order to find a job and get set up in that area if you dont have that or you simply want to be where you are what about being self employed think about where you are and what you could offer to your area there are many things to be doing to earn money with little or no start up costs and will be first step to getting you out and about
GetMotivated,not_removed,join the military not if you arent into that kinda stuff but ive heard of many a guy in the same rut who just needed something to change or a little push and it ended up changing their lives just a thought wish you well though
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was wonderful i appreciate your input shenanigans i love that quote you put there in the end thank you so much youve given me a lot to ponder i appreciate you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you so much i need to take the time to remind myself that i dont have to have everything figured out yet at this age i appreciate this ✌

GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck it im inspired from now on im a brave orangutan
GetMotivated,not_removed,now that youve reached the fruit just paint a happy little bush in the corner
GetMotivated,not_removed,i fall asleep with the joy of painting on loopi dig asmr shit like that for sleep my life is so much more chill now that i wake up and fall asleep to bob rosss voice waking up to you can do anything here this is your world and there are no mistakes changes the game dramatically
GetMotivated,not_removed,bob ross never died tupac bob ross and jesus formed the illuminati in i have proof
GetMotivated,not_removed,such a god damn saint that man
GetMotivated,not_removed,no matter how cynical reddit always is i love how positive bob ross threads are
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,just had this on the other day the crazy painting for the series
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love bob
GetMotivated,not_removed,hes such a good soul i wish i had his character
GetMotivated,not_removed,its actually a mark twain quote why not go out on a limb isnt that where the fruit is
GetMotivated,not_removed,a realistic thought from bob ross oooh if you have never been to alaska go there while it is still wild my favorite uncle asked me if i wanted to go there uncle sam he said if you dont go youre going to jail that is how uncle sam asks you
GetMotivated,not_removed,based ross
GetMotivated,not_removed,i only netflix and chill when bob ross is on
GetMotivated,not_removed,i discovered asmr from this man so god bless him seriously he used to relax the shit out of me when i was like years old this dude is a legend
GetMotivated,not_removed,bob ross my man
GetMotivated,not_removed,fairly certain that the reason you dont go out on limbs is because they will break and you will fall and break yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,bob rules
GetMotivated,not_removed,the next day op was found dead below a tree having climbed onto an unstable branch to pick fruit unfortunately it was an oak tree
GetMotivated,not_removed,hes fucking right
GetMotivated,not_removed,noneng here what does this idiom mean
GetMotivated,not_removed,name checks out
GetMotivated,not_removed,painting happy little trees
GetMotivated,not_removed,his family set up a twitch stream of him httpswwwtwitchtvbobross
GetMotivated,not_removed,me and this guy would have been buds
GetMotivated,not_removed,what the hell is bob painting though
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought mark twain said that
GetMotivated,not_removed,so bob ross has the same effect on me as morgan freeman i definitely read this in a bob ross voice and am actually motivated might even rehab a squirrel or two
GetMotivated,not_removed,how creepy would it be if one day we found out that all the landscapes bob ross paint were places he had hidden bodies over the years
GetMotivated,not_removed,or just wait till the fruit falls from the tree itself barely even have to exert energy to pick that up amirite i miss that guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,but what if you fall and hurt yourself so bad that you cant get up
GetMotivated,not_removed,not if youre looking for pineapples
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant tell whether this is giving out motivation for fitness or tips for people seeing the world or meeting people
GetMotivated,not_removed,does anyone know what episode of the joy of painting this is that composition looks pretty unique for bob ross i wanna check that shit out
GetMotivated,not_removed,there
GetMotivated,not_removed,this quote was in a jamba juice near me
GetMotivated,not_removed,hell yeah dude i fucking love fruit
GetMotivated,not_removed,kys
GetMotivated,not_removed,havent seen it posted yet but this
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have to be very careful how i say this because clearly bob ross is a huge hero on reddit and i too have huge respect for the guy but isnt bob literally the embodiment of not going out on a limb virtually every painting he ever produced was more or less the same kind of mountainscapeforest type assembly with one or two rare exceptions if anything he was the epitome of sticking to what you know
GetMotivated,not_removed,now beat the little devil out of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,miss you bob
GetMotivated,not_removed,the orlando shooter was also inspired by this quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,quick turn on the tellie and see if god is painting trees or clouds
GetMotivated,not_removed,michael scott
GetMotivated,not_removed,we dont call homosexual people fruits anymore thats rude we also do not hang them from trees what is this the
GetMotivated,not_removed,in hour you get a nice painting soup for the soul and you get to look at the professional perm
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought the fruit was on church street
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been spending my life waiting for the fruit to fall to the ground
GetMotivated,not_removed,and always remember theres no such thing as mistakes just happy little accidents i will always love you bob
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont understand painting but listening to this guy is pretty relaxing for my ears big up for bob
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a mark twain quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,im gonna put this bush right over here and this will be our little secret
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is also doyle brunsons favorite quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh thats where they are no wonder ive had no luck at the gay bar
GetMotivated,not_removed,gotta be honest i always thought the adage of going out on a limb was in reference to an extremity bob simultaneously schooled me in language and life
GetMotivated,not_removed,no pressure
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats also what breaks first when the winds blow but whateveroptimism
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like to picture bob ross and an incredible hulk type guy it took a long time but when he eventually lost his temper he was a raging maniac with muscles and veins bulging
GetMotivated,not_removed,can we be friends liquid mushrooms you say very interesting i didnt know that was a thing been munching on some home brew cyans recently d i love not having to eat an entire quad just to feel something with the cubies
GetMotivated,not_removed,frank scully why not go out on a limb isnt that where the fruit is
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice try bob i know youre just going to saw the branch off when i go for the fruit
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really dont believe these one liners with such ambiguous meaning are actually of any use to anyone when it comes to motivation just how i feel
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry but who the fck is this guy and why is he all over reddit all the time the only things i know about him are that he did landscape paintings and that he is dead
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was a lpt given to him by his local pastor back in for sure the further along my limb you go bob the closer you will get to my fruit balls
GetMotivated,not_removed,that painting is terrible
GetMotivated,not_removed,and dont be afraid to rob your mentor of his business model and undermine a mans lifes work cuz thats where the money is bob aint as cool as reddit thinks he is e only thats the best you millenials got you dont even know of the all mighty brush e thats better posers e do you people even know of bill alexander and how his prize student bob basically stole his retirement out from under him by copying his business model to the tee e x do you know mr alexanders pain to see a student rape your ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,he looks like a fruit
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome so the mods motivated you to improve your content posting
GetMotivated,not_removed,bob has a glorious fro for a white manamen
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to the panda
GetMotivated,not_removed,its probably just because i saw the other one first but i actually prefer it to this though i can understand why one would be irritated by it i guess its got that meme look or whatever but even so its more in your face and in this format it lacks the punchline factor dont be afraid to go out on a limb because thats where the fruit is d the way it is here just doesnt seem as full of life edit granted this is just my opinion of course a large number of you probably like this one over the former no worries so long as everyone benefits
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats where the fruit is brotha
GetMotivated,not_removed,be careful
GetMotivated,not_removed,bob ross is so inspiring last year i was so into his videos that i tried to make paintings for my familys christmas gifts
GetMotivated,not_removed,after all once youre that far out if the branch breaks you gotta
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you sleep to his voice do you beat the devil out of it httpiimgurcomihrhpdngifv
GetMotivated,not_removed,watching bob ross is like having xanax when you dont have xanax
GetMotivated,not_removed,is it that good ive never seen it
GetMotivated,not_removed,lately ive been falling asleep to south park all episodes shuffling and then i wake up to south park as well and i never know what episode to expect to see its great but i think i should try and go for something more chill some nights too the joy of painting might be a good idea to mix it up from time to time
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyve since retired to atlantis and handed control over to steve irwin paul walker and harambe
GetMotivated,not_removed,and what lies in the centre harambe
GetMotivated,not_removed,were gonna get back on cipher boss
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive seen this proof firsthand ama
GetMotivated,not_removed,the bob ross quote is a bob ross quote seeing as its something he said with the words he used to say it your mark twain quote isnt even the same words so he wasnt quoting mark twain
GetMotivated,not_removed,im pretty sure its actually a wayne gretzky quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,god was having a good day when he make alaska
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you go out on a limb it means youre taking a risk hes saying that you need to take chancesrisks in order to get the best rewards i hope this makes sense i got selfconscious about if i was using idioms in my explanation or not lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,his family company set up a twitch stream of him
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgzollyhpng
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,he generally stuck to an easy style for the tv audience because he wanted to produce something that everyday people could try and mimic im sure some of the paintings his family have are ridiculous
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikibobross
GetMotivated,not_removed,you just need to watch a few seconds of any of his videos to get a real good impression of his character
GetMotivated,not_removed,xdddd child molestation is funny because people who dont think like me are stupid
GetMotivated,not_removed,ross is a legend painter i used to watch some of his shows when i was very young he has skill and his show was relaxing
GetMotivated,not_removed,if it makes you feel better httpiimgurcomgzollyhpng when he finished
GetMotivated,not_removed,minutes isnt much time especially if you occasionally stop to show off wild animals that you are nursing back to health or raising to be free someday
GetMotivated,not_removed,mods are improving my quality shit posts
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was really expecting that to be a video of trump
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mean this wont work that was my plan for this christmas
GetMotivated,not_removed,who doesnt beat the devil out of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,visual xanax coming down off some good acid with a lil bit of weed some bob ross playing oo boy does that hit the spot
GetMotivated,not_removed,he has his own twitch channel where they are still pimping all the bob ross swag pretty sure they archived all his shows there as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,its on netflix and yes it is that good
GetMotivated,not_removed,so meta
GetMotivated,not_removed,how was your day
GetMotivated,not_removed,but what if i like vegetables and i dont want the fruit should i not take risks then
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are great
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrdctxbzmy
GetMotivated,not_removed,come on im eating right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,brave that aint trump
GetMotivated,not_removed,it totally worked i mean i didnt think they we that great but my family seemed to really enjoy them so much so that they argued over one in particular
GetMotivated,not_removed,that sounds quite nice
GetMotivated,not_removed,they uploaded seasons to on youtube and add a new episode every day i actually built httpwwwtwoinchbrushcom for all the episodes on youtube last week so you can search them by pics of the finished paintings
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is correct
GetMotivated,not_removed,the idea is that if youre climbing a tree you dont wanna fall going out on a tree limb is dangerous because it gets thinner and eventually it wont support your weight naturally youll wanna stay around the trunk or the areas where the limbs are thickest where they connect and not out on a limb where theres a risk of falling failing
GetMotivated,not_removed,there are probably risks with vegetable harvesting that are just not as catchy
GetMotivated,not_removed,rnocontext
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup he doesnt have the stones to dodge sniper fire in bosnia like hilldawg did
GetMotivated,not_removed,ahh the spirit of christmas indeed captured it brilliantly id say
GetMotivated,not_removed,it really is i have found that watching bob ross while tripping not only makes for amazing visuals but it really chills out the vibe if you are with friends love or hate the ross lulz will be had
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice must remember to turn him on whenever i get liquid mushrooms
GetMotivated,not_removed,i forgot to tell you that show was amazing while on shrooms like omgdark room headphones and a few eps so good
GetMotivated,not_removed,rnocontext
GetMotivated,not_removed,rnocontext
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really like this version the pessimist complains about the wind the optimist hopes for it to change the realist adjusts the sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless you play the winds requiem up left right
GetMotivated,not_removed,love jim rohn
GetMotivated,not_removed,how does this apply to someone with terminal cancer
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless you dont have a httpsenwikipediaorgwikicentreboard in which case you will be blown wherever the wind is blowing no matter what you do or how you adjust your sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,even though its not the exact version of the quote used in the game i still read this in lenard nimoys voice as the narrator from civ iv
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminds me of the civ sailing quote you cant direct the wind but you can adjust your sails unknown
GetMotivated,not_removed,adjust your sales
GetMotivated,not_removed,windwaker says fuck your shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilateen wasnt invented yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,my high school class motto is very similar all the girls came up with it my friend and i joke and say you cant blow the sails but you can blow the captain
GetMotivated,not_removed,the sailor albert einstein
GetMotivated,not_removed,so what if the wind is blowing directly against you not a seaman
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres a fart joke somewhere in there
GetMotivated,not_removed,there isnt always wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,um no you cant say im in the middle of the atlantic facing north and i need to get to north america i would need the wind to blow west so i could make it there if it was blowing any other direction it would not be possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is like saying you should conform
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless the wind breaks the sails and you lack the ability or resources to fix them
GetMotivated,not_removed,breakthrough
GetMotivated,not_removed,if the facts dont match the theory change the facts
GetMotivated,not_removed,would be better if you said the realist grabs an oar wind cannot always be harnessed using sails and oars involve hard work to get where you are going
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the capitalist starts his hp outboard
GetMotivated,not_removed,tss yeah why dont you tell em to not get cancer or sumpthin tss
GetMotivated,not_removed,cancer would be wind your attitude to it would be sails
GetMotivated,not_removed,accept a shady deal to cure your cancer and become a superhero winds change again and you get screwed over and turned into an avocado then go hunt a guy named francis
GetMotivated,not_removed,the best you could do in that situation is spend what time you have left and utilize your limited resources to extend said time this could pretty much sum up all of your lifetime though
GetMotivated,not_removed,duldrums
GetMotivated,not_removed,be realistic and understand that you cant afford the recommended treatments soyou move to colorado so you can self medicate your pain and sadness with cannabis unexpectedly you are one of the type of patients that have your cancerous tumors shrink from cannabis you then try mushrooms and realize your purpose in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,or better yet youll be capsized
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck i must not have a centreboard that explains my life
GetMotivated,not_removed,some boats have a built on keep and larger historic boats just had a massive keep incorporated schooners ships of the line your argument is made of lies
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought the quote weak also any sailor knows the sail always faces the same way relative to the wind the boat just turns under it using a centerboard to force it forward
GetMotivated,not_removed,or you have a knot opposing current a headwind and a hull speed of knots ask me how i know
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can sail at angles to the wind with square riggers the lateen was actually utilized on egyptian stuff so its pretty old modern boats use the delta sail but squares can be a certain degree into the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,tacking where you use a zig zag motion to sail into the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,if it was blowing another direction you could tack and jibe basically go on a diagonal and gradually make progress but itd be really really slow and frustrating
GetMotivated,not_removed,depending on the construction of the hull and the sails the wind can be harnessed to varying degrees of efficacy a heavy hull might not move in a light breeze very quickly but it will move at least enough to respond to the rudder
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the opportunist uses both when ideal
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know why youre being downvoted this comment is very realistic
GetMotivated,not_removed,an oar is just going to get you moving in circles you need two to move the boat in a straight line
GetMotivated,not_removed,has his slaves row the boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,go to break
GetMotivated,not_removed,would you dare to fucking tease any cancer patient in real life go shove your sunshine and rainbows up your ass what do you tell these kids as they get on the cattlecar
GetMotivated,not_removed,affairs in order spent all my money on failed treatment leaving family with huge debt i guess i can add pain pill dependency to my list of failures before i leave existence personally id prefer to cut out the middle man and literally bite the bullet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i believe what youre referring to is the keel
GetMotivated,not_removed,not even just modern boats tacking against the wind has been around for ages
GetMotivated,not_removed,if the wind is blowing directly at you you wont be going towards your goal i stand corrected oars for no wind though
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,except hard work does not always translate into success
GetMotivated,not_removed,every sail boat has a rudder youll be fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,you can paddle on both sideslike a kayak
GetMotivated,not_removed,depends on how you use it and the style of oar kayaks only have one oar and some oars are doublesided
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre putting way too much thought into it you pessimist
GetMotivated,not_removed,might not have put it that way but id have to agree serieshybrid is treating death very lightly which is probably incredibly painful for people struggling with cancer their own or someone elses
GetMotivated,not_removed,well we know getting angry at people on reddit wont extend their lives but humor might ease their pain
GetMotivated,not_removed,the fuck
GetMotivated,not_removed,dependency on pain pills is not the patients fault its a side effect of an imperfect medical system which both overprescribes and undercontrols the use of opiates its a serious problem one which killed my brother because he became addicted after open heart surgery and corrective eye surgeries during his childhoodteenage years the closest he got to quitting was when i finally introduced him to marijuana in a positive context where he could relax before settling down some due to pot he had been an opiate pill addict heroine addict switched to meth because it was cheap then back to pills and tried to get that under control with an opiate receptor nullifier which i cant remember which they charged us hundreds of dollars a month for from a special clinic leaving our family broke and unhappy while he fought his addiction he was doing alright going to narc anon but we couldnt pay for the opiate therapy and he relapsed and finally died years ago this august
GetMotivated,not_removed,fuck autocorrect mate
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what tacking is for
GetMotivated,not_removed,no matter where you are the wind is always blowing directly at you
GetMotivated,not_removed,which is why that is a better ending than adjusting sails to always reach your goal a realist would know thats disingenuous
GetMotivated,not_removed,im unsure of what that is explain how it moves you directly against the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,tacking involves angling the boat across the wind in a zigzag pattern allowing the wind to catch the sail sideways and propel it diagonally forwards by beating the boat side to side in that zigzag pattern its able to repeatedly catch that wind while maintaining a relatively straight course against the wind
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh i guess that would work however when you hit an area with no wind you still need to row
GetMotivated,not_removed,of course without wind a sailboats just a boat
GetMotivated,not_removed,think of tacking like when you were a kid riding your bike up a big hill you do this weird motion back and forth while still moving forwards
GetMotivated,not_removed,a boat with a fancy blanket
GetMotivated,not_removed,life is nothing more than a series of days plugged together in our memories anyway all we can do is master the day we are living in
GetMotivated,not_removed,my fog brain read that as youre not going to matter at first
GetMotivated,not_removed,love this thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,in a way it is kinda true none of us are going to matter and that fact is my sole motivator at times
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would recommend reading the power of habit by charles duhigg first once you start to see your own habits through that lens cue routine reward it makes it much easier to change your lifestyle from that start to create a small set of routines i recommend a morning routine and a bedtime routine sometimes called morningnight rituals lots of guides if you google once you create a few routines it becomes far far easier to stick to things its all about learning the process from there you can shape that process to achieve your own specific goals
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres no secret man the biggest hurtle is just getting outside or to the gym or whereever start small if you must and build from there as far as motivation goes constantly remind yourself of why you want to change or what you want to change i to have a desk job at a company with a drinking culture and was a smoker just pick out a couple days where you exercise instead of drink also once you start working out youll feel obliged to quit smoking i never really felt shortness of until recently and exercise really drew attention to it i dont know exactly how youll feel but it made quitting smoking a lot easier after really feeling the effects of it and i used to love smoking like a tobacco connoisseur anyways good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed with the comments regarding habit i was in similar circumstances though still wrestling with alcohol a bit the biggest change is my routine i wake at gym at meditate from and bed at ive been doing this for about months now and it made a big difference in my attitude and productivity worth it watch vacation went on vacation for a week took another week to get back into the routine this week i am back at it anytime is a good time to start feeling better
GetMotivated,not_removed,your story sounds a lot like mine back in i wrote up a post about my transformation on rfitness it wasnt a complete physical transformation but it changed my life completely
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for the recommendation ill have the check it out that makes sense with the cue routine reward thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the tips ive since left the job and am looking for work in a healthier environment not as easy as i thought in regards to the smoking that sounds like a good plan of action ive been trying to find the right time to quit and keep coming up with excuses but i can see how once other things start to change that would just sort of fall away as it wouldnt make sense helps me feel a bit less pressure to just outright quit which is stressful enough as it is
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you vacation is always my downfall i was starting to cut back on smoking pretty decently then went on a camping weekend just recently drinkin smokin straight west coastin basically thats an early routine good for you for sticking with it how long was it before you started to feel results from the new routine if i may ask
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for sharing this ill check it out right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have another week vacation coming up though excited there is a bit of dread about it as well lucky to have that dread as a problem it took a couple of weeks before i started to feelum elevated interesting i know the feeling but really hadnt thought to use a word to describe it
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey congratz on putting yourself out there i dont have any ideas for challenges but i wish you the best on whatever you decide to do
GetMotivated,not_removed,dude this made me smile so hard keep up the good work my man
GetMotivated,not_removed,mad ups to you my dude i watched some of your other vids and learned a bit about your whole social skydiving thing and im just really proud of you i think so many of us are washed into believing things like were inconveniencing people with our time or interaction and its just foofoo im learning about this my self and its rad to see someone else tackling it in your own awesome way id like to note that the idea of some of these gave me anxiety until i saw you actually do it and realized it wasnt that bad and in fact was even really rad the happy birthday one comes to mind and i think that is applicable to most inhibiting anxietiesfears only thing i can think of is maybe asking to take pictures with strangers or maybe drink conversation
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre actually pretty good dude that beat with the ukulele was sickkkk
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey man thanks for sharing that made me smile loved the ukulele guys voice
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really enjoyed watching your video its great that you are trying to better yourself and step outside your comfort zone thats super impressive that you speak japanese regardless if you think your skills are good or bad its impressive that you can live in another country and use and learn their language to communicate awesome job
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats sounds like it was a great experience d
GetMotivated,not_removed,this was awesome to see homie keep pushing
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really enjoyed your video man i love how those girls just giggled at you the whole time ive been saying for years that id love to live in japan for some amount of time maybe a year just for fun ive never been out of the us so living somewhere like that really interests me can i ask how you broke into learning japanese where did you start any tips you can share that you wish youd been given when you started to learn
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,good stuff mansocial skydiving i love that term
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice one man and i think this sort of thing puts your statement of being shy to rest
GetMotivated,not_removed,i got a social challenge for you op reenact a scene from script from one of those cheesy soap operas with a random stranger
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is just beautiful bruh i might actually try some of these too great way to face fears
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty awesome keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i were to watch this video without reading the backstory of you being very shy i would initially think you are outgoing and confident youre also really cute by the way lol im pretty outgoing myself and id totally approach you to start up a conversation just based off your looks then your beatboxing would be a major plus
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love this challenge not only are you pushing the limits of your comfort zone but youre offering value to random people by putting yourself out there like that you probably made a lot of peoples day and spread some super positive vibes seriously good job man
GetMotivated,not_removed,what part of japan you in i lived in iwakuni which is in the southern part when i was stationed there in the marines
GetMotivated,not_removed,my anxiety is extreme because i also have an acute case of hyperhydrosis which prevents me from doing very simple stuff ppl take for granted like just taking a walk talk less of even speaking to strangers sometimes i just wish i wasnt born or i lived on a remote island somewhere far from ppl ive flunked or nearly flunked several college exams bcs i wrote a paper in just to be out of there i get really sad when i think about the direction my life is headed
GetMotivated,not_removed,your japanese is so awful i am positive you simply can not ever learn it you are just not smart like the japanese or we special gaijin who have learned it to native perfection stop what you are doing you are a sideshow go teach eikaiwa or return to arkanas or whatever small town you went to junior college at you are a bad gaijin leave you make good gaijin like me look worse
GetMotivated,not_removed,hey thanks a lot yeah it was really nerve wracking but at the same time so much fun and so worth it amazing what unexpected things can happen when one challenges their comfort zone
GetMotivated,not_removed,ah man im so glad to hear it that i shall
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the support yeah as you might expect i was always inspired by people who did public pranks and social experiments i thought it took a lot of bravery for someone to put themselves through so much social pressure at one time in my life i thought i could never do something like that so this social skydiving project is an attempt to shatter that belief yeah thats an awesome idea i think im gonna try it
GetMotivated,not_removed,im glad you think so it felt so intimidating doing a collab with such a good musician
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah definitely glad you found it of value and right hes an incredible musician
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you so much for your kind words yeah ive been shy and had trouble with social anxiety my whole life and feel i missed out on a lot of opportunities about a year ago i had encountered that final proverbial straw and decided i was gonna start doing crazy stuff like this in order to get over that shyness its been a long road with slow progress but everyone once in a while im surprised with the cool unexpected stuff that happens im glad you found value in it as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks a lot yeah it was super fun and i even surprised myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,appreciate it man
GetMotivated,not_removed,ya i second that inspiring to see you tackle shyness in another country in a difficult language
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha right very stereotypical although very typical p yeah it was the same for me i grew up in oregon and didnt leave the states until i was japan was my first country and it was the best decision ive ever made although im sure there many great choices sure this is super super general advice but its one that has helped me the most with learning japanese and that is to do something everyday even if that something is small try to be consistent and not go a day without studying japanese even if its only one minute for that day because even if its only one minute you are fortifying the habit of studying japanese which is the most important part of the process otherwise id say look into the application for computer or smartphone called anki and learn as much vocabulary as you can
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad you liked it had a lot of fun doing it
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad to hear it yeah social skydiving has been around for a while i didnt come up with it but i love using it to describe these social challenges as the skydiving part implies that they are intense thrilling and fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks man i know what you mean but i think i still got a long way to go
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like it putting it down on the list
GetMotivated,not_removed,do it and let me know how it goes
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks definitely going to
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the kind words im working on getting over my nerves little by little
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks a lot i sure hope so
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh wow pretty far from me but looks like a place ill have to visit sometime i live in gunma
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the feedback yeah i really didnt have any idea what i was doing just trying to have fun with it hopefully next one will be a little better
GetMotivated,not_removed,the fuck outta here weeb hes experiencing new things and trying to improve on aspects of himself he feels need improvement or just wants too maybe you should try being less of a sausage
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a great idea legit im already jumping into more interactions with strangers when i see the opportunities
GetMotivated,not_removed,lifes too short amiright but in all seriousness i hope you continue to do this stuff its cool to see what happens
GetMotivated,not_removed,im somewhat shy myself and have considered doing random outofmyshell crazy stuff but never really felt like it im curious you say long road and slow progress how much progress have you made in this year like out of to where did you start and where are you now being as outgoing as you could be within possibility
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the advice man this beatboxing video lead me to your day vlog series which im really really enjoying would you mind if i pmd you with questions and such about it im beyond intrigued
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have a thing for approaching people so this for me is really impressive from someone who is shy
GetMotivated,not_removed,how long you been there i loved being in japan amazing country
GetMotivated,not_removed,oppa gunma style
GetMotivated,not_removed,disagree charging the money was a great way to confirm consent and get buyin this was as much a sales experiment as a social one congratulations btw this was pretty awesome you could travel the world and pay for it by doing shtick like this
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome to hear glad i could help motivate
GetMotivated,not_removed,actually i was born and raised in america ive been living in japan for about four years now im yo
GetMotivated,not_removed,it sure is and i sure will and the funny thing is what happens is always random and unexpected so the next thing i try could bomb horribly and be lame just gotta keep moving forward
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats awesome it takes effort but i think youll find that the results you see are worth the effort at least that has been the case with me and thats why i have kept going and thats really tough to answer it depends heavily on the situation as well to make a really rough estimate id say i went from maybe a to a i still feel shy in a lot of situations and honestly it takes a lot of effort to get over my nerves and put myself out there but i think the difference now is that no matter how hard it feels i have the feeling that i can if i try the challenges that i did become a sort of proof i think if i can stand up and sing happy birthday to myself in a crowded restaurant an older challenge i did then i can surely go to this job interviewtalk to this persontry this new thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,ah yeah thanks for the good questions and thats awesome pretty sure i talk a bit about learning japanese in those vids as well of course feel free to pm me
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have a similar thing for approaching people in fact quite very frustrating because i think ive missed out on a lot of opportunities thats why i started this kind of training by doing challenges to try to overcome it
GetMotivated,not_removed,four years now and yeah i love it too how long were you here
GetMotivated,not_removed,the freshest of gunma style representin the rice fields of jp
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a good point too my reasoning for adding the sales part to the experiment was to add more pressure to myself if i had just walked up and beatboxed to people for free that surely would have been enough pressure in itself however turning it into a challenge to make the sale and then having the added pressure of having to perform well enough to live up to the sale was a way of making it a more intense challenge for myself as much as this was a social experiment it was also a challenge for me to open myself up and stop being shy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i always thought about moving to japan some day did you learn japanese before moving to japan or did you learn it while in japan also do you feel more or less shy when approaching americans in japan edit also whats some tip or things you do to help you overcome your shyness and engage your audience
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah great idea i think im going to try to do something like this to overcome my shyness great man youre an inspiration
GetMotivated,not_removed,i was there for in japan for almost years first i was in okinawa for about months then moved to iwakuni for year and a half i want to go back what do you do there did you get a degree and teach english
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you have interest id totally recommend at least a short stay and see how you like it i actually started learning japanese about a year before going to japan and i felt it helped me acclimate much more being able to get by in the language a bit thats a good question it depends on how im approaching them westerners are generally more aware of social pranksexperiments so often its almost like they already know what im up to before i can even talk to them whereas the japanese dont really expect as much or at least expect it less although having to speak japanese makes me feel much more shy really id say its about even as far as coming over shyness what i did and still continue to do is make baby steps and then just accept its gonna take a looong time to progress i havent really talked about it on video but my first challenge i ever did was to go out in public and just say hello to strangers then i progressed to my next challenge which was to go out and start a conversation with strangers lastly my good friend who is now a real confident dude but came from a place of huge social anxiety gave me the best piece of advice which is to just pretend you are confident all the time so when im actually approaching people on the street i am nervous as hell but i do my best to act as if im confident with the best posture and eye contact and vocal projection i can muster after a while it gets a little easier and comes more naturally
GetMotivated,not_removed,man im glad to hear it let me know how it goes when you try some stuff out
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh man thats awesome i have been to neither of those places yet wanna see okinawa really bad yep doing the english teaching thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,none was taken i know i have a lot i need to improve and every little bit of feedback helps i hope to do a better job next time
GetMotivated,not_removed,people who know me now would never call me shy but as a child i would hide behind my mother and cry when people asked me questions or even looked at me i dont remember what prompted it but i realized i could put on a mask that would protect me i would close my eyes and imagine pulling light into my cheeks and eyes and when i opened my eyes the inner me was safe from any rejection or criticism it helped me act more out going but it also later created a minor crisis about the inner me vs the show me but i think ive got that figured out so pretending i was confident helped me too i admire your courage offering up beatboxing that seems really intimate and personal to me so very risky offering it to others you are brave and powerful good luck with your journey
GetMotivated,not_removed,you bet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i want to go to school for veterinary doctor id be glad moving to japan to be a veterinarian

GetMotivated,not_removed,wow very good just wondering how you were able to pull from to pm that is very tough do you exercise or drink a lot of coffee
GetMotivated,not_removed,damn i really needed this post all of this time i have been looking for ways to combat my approach anxiety and the answer is that i might not initially be able to find a way to suppress it i will take action and be scared but thats okay
GetMotivated,not_removed,now or never
GetMotivated,not_removed,great story op i like the message you have about life do or die and if you fear something do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome post and fantastic journey thanks for posting it very inspiring
GetMotivated,not_removed,for travel many of the first few months were completely solo with that camera you just left work and traveled for months im on the same journey than you in my own way some things are different and others things are very close i would really love to have the opportunity to chat with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpwwwyoutubecomcmiovino i specifically just put a video related to this post you can watch here thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,here ya go httpwwwyoutubecomcmiovino
GetMotivated,not_removed,only because you asked httpwwwyoutubecomcmiovino
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what i initially though im working i have to stay put work and be boring i traveled on the weekends get up at drive sometimes hours or more up to when we went to south carolina for the longer ones i used a day of pto paid time off here and there to help i still have yet to be on a plane ha landing a year job i have friends who started at in it out of college im not in it but in a low income city what i make now i believe is low compared to the nation actually
GetMotivated,not_removed,since you asked httpwwwyoutubecomcmiovino
GetMotivated,not_removed,lift every other day i didnt do coffee at all up until that point but then started ya had to do something i remember sleeping in a conference room once and having someone walk in ha
GetMotivated,not_removed,no still had to work ha i traveled on weekends and used a lot of pto i had saved up from years of being boring and not using it at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,so coffee really helped do you still drink coffee now
GetMotivated,not_removed,im single no attachments in a foreign country with a car and enough disposable income to boost m journey towards self fulfillment what would you recommend i do on weekends i already have a broad perspective on the world ive lived in countries on continents im fluent in languages and can communicate in two others i have a huge religious background that i dumped a year ago and have been trying to forge myself ever since i lift three times a week i say yes to practically every social opportunity that comes but thats pretty much it i dont cold approach people but i can make conversation with strangers i dont travel outside of the city enough im not doing any outdoors thing just to meditate while being out in nature what logistically easy things would you recommend and again i would love to chat with you if you have te time
GetMotivated,not_removed,like i get the message but i dont think i can agree with that general philosophy
GetMotivated,not_removed,at least regarding self control of your time you could look at it two ways one is the you just do things that are fun and dont worry about the necessary stuff because you may die tomorrow two is that because you may die tomorrow you want to get the most out of life that you can therefore you budget your time appropriately and learn to stay focused on the task at hand so that you spend less time working and more time enjoying life obviously we know which mindset is best but the task of getting to that point can be very daunting and involves growing your self control muscles to new heights what i get from this is the importance to continue working on that second mindset so that you can have your dessert first but also still pay the bills
GetMotivated,not_removed,joe rogan is da man

GetMotivated,not_removed,this was great thank you for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,rfuckingmanly i love this guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,must not nut
GetMotivated,not_removed,what does that even mean
GetMotivated,not_removed,wtf
GetMotivated,not_removed,didnt hit me at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,great video especially the spacey part as the title indicated loved it
GetMotivated,not_removed,everything around you in life was made by people that are no smarter than you is such a bullshit quote though lol﻿
GetMotivated,not_removed,tak i think so too glad you enjoyed it
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice table to motive you to save more money
GetMotivated,not_removed,knowing how you compare is the best motivation
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah id like to order one large phone with extra phones please cellphone no no no no rotary and payphone on half
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is after he was in apocalypse now
GetMotivated,not_removed,key word here is might if you are really good at your job and the company starts relying on you sometimes management becomes reluctant to move you to a better position and will instead promote someone else who deserves it less leading to eventual employee resentment management never learns
GetMotivated,not_removed,seriously thank you for this i never knew that cowboy curtis was lawrence love reddit
GetMotivated,not_removed,that actually seems like a pretty awesome job but i take your point
GetMotivated,not_removed,this doesnt look like anything to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,id point out that even that statement implies that it also might not i mean hell if im not patient or even do a really terrible job it might lead to much better opportunities
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont like uh talkin chairs
GetMotivated,not_removed,pee wees play house a crappy job get real
GetMotivated,not_removed,note also that laurence did not try to get promoted and climb the ladder at peewee doing your best at the task at hand is only the beginning
GetMotivated,not_removed,says your boss hoping you continue working harder for the same or smaller pay
GetMotivated,not_removed,id tell you you obviously havent worked retail or in a cafe
GetMotivated,not_removed,one large person with extra people please white people no no no black people and hispanics on half
GetMotivated,not_removed,also king of new york
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah he made a bunch of money there and then got a steady job on tv smart guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive kind of always known it and its earned him many points he also married httpswwwgooglecomsearchqginatorrestbmisch which earns him a lifetime supply of points
GetMotivated,not_removed,i see your point too but to see him today in interviews he seems to take himself rather seriously as a very serious actor i used to think he might take himself a little too seriously but now think i misjudged him my kids were watching pee wees playhouse today and i saw him as cowboy curtis if you look up a clip on youtube youll see he is by no means phoning it in or acting like this goofy character is beneath him he is clearly trying his very best to kick the absolute shit out of the job in front of him and that impressed me so i guess now he earned the right to think of himself as a serious actor because he paid his dues and with cowboy curtis he proved the wisdom of that old saying that there are no bad roles only bad actors
GetMotivated,not_removed,whatever i think if youre aspiring to be a serious actor and maybe win an oscar someday yeah i would definitely say you might look at playing a pastelwearing jheri curled singing cowboy as not an ideal job and more of a paycheque to keep from starving to death
GetMotivated,not_removed,one large sofa chair with extra chair please high chair no no no recliner and wheelchair on half
GetMotivated,not_removed,but it satisfied one of his dreams and buffs his selfesteem and sense of accomplishment
GetMotivated,not_removed,i tell myself to gain the serenity to accept the things i just cant change but the courage to change the things i can and its hard sometimes because the things i cant change are so awful and all consuming but life is about playing the hand youre dealt as best as you can no matter how shitty it is
GetMotivated,not_removed,interesting revelation i believe in fate and what must be will be no matter what you do or what changes fate finds a way to make it happen have a fab new year all
GetMotivated,not_removed,the answer is in the middle and also there are a lot of facts that stop you from achieving goals like this and i thinks napoleon hills secret are good for controling the mind thank you for sharing your ideas my friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do you know something cant change
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt steal that car fate made me do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you know you know my parents and my grandparents are dead for one thing aint no changing that
GetMotivated,not_removed,hahaha okay i see your point
GetMotivated,not_removed,you fighting you are making yourself stronger with experience unlike those who have it easy youre at a low but you will get up and keep trying what do you expect sobbing on reddit to do youre just prolonging you have the capability as you mentioned you got this
GetMotivated,not_removed,just be patient buddy we all have rough patches as for advice regarding the career you are pursing i suggest you take some private time to develop the skills such as developing fitness because of your body type which leads to prejudgements and not to worry worst case is that you undertake a different career path to ensure security i will also suggest dont compare your life to those above you yes take it as motivation to do better but dont make it halt you or feel down since you are muslim here is a quranic verse and behold with every hardship comes ease
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a greater good and greater purpose that we must all strive for money does not bring peace only short lived memories that need to be greater like a drug user all true peace comes from inside oneself i too have many friends that make much more than me but they all seem to be chasing butterflies with machine guns nothing left when they get to the end make peace with yourself not with others judge you to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a reason you keep getting fired find what that reason is physical labour isnt the path to an easy succesful life that life lies in books and in offices the use of the mind pursue a career that will enable you to buy that bungalow like your friends dont be short term minded so what youve gone through a few jobs youre young and none of them are careers theyre temporary money makers dont give up you can do whatever you set your mind to as long as you put forth the necessary effort and work
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sobbing i just wanted some motivation and advice thanks you for your kind words
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you im a minority in my country im not muslim thank you for the verse
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes i wonder if he is there
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do i make peace with myself everything around me need money food rent tuitions and many more
GetMotivated,not_removed,why did you say that life lies in books and offices
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a great tribute to your friend and an even better gift to your self i am sorry for your loss
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes it takes a sad event to give us the strength to do what we know in our heart is right
GetMotivated,not_removed,i used to weigh and am losing weight rapidly without exercise just by cutting out carbs once my weight gets down to about ill add exercise to the mix its just too hard on my body presently to exercise in an effective way meanwhile diet is key its always key but even more so when youre diabetic keep your health now or lose all health later
GetMotivated,not_removed,remember that at times you will fall of the wagon dont throw it in acknowledge it have a breather and get back in there
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry for you loss mate and know well be cheering for you also check out httpswwwredditcomrketo if you love cheese like i do and still want to shed the pounds
GetMotivated,not_removed,live for him
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a wonderful way to turn your grief into something positive im sure your friend would approve while i too think eating keto is a great way to stay healthy i have to caution you that some of the people on that sub are really not the nicest try not to let that keep you from learning about the keto way of eating best of luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,just saying straight away as someone who has lost weight doing less exercise than you have its almost all about the diet running miles a day for days a week thats insane i mean its not unhealthy but its a lot of exercise you say you cut out bread beer and cheese but those are not the only culprits of a bad diet honestly i think its ok to eat all of those but whats important is caloric intake figure out how much you should eat a day for me it was calories and exercise on top of that that will almost double your weight loss endeavours i can almost guarantee you all that running and lifting actually doesnt matter if you eat like calories of nonbreadnonbeernoncheese foods out there just a friendly reminder is all congratz on the current success on weight loss and im sorry to hear about your friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,good work from to here i took off before i stared running mostly from being embarassed but now i run days a week and a long run on weekends averaging around miles a week and havent had any problems with my knees or injuries
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry for your loss ill give you a quick tip focus on building an active lifestyle rather than reaching a particular weight try to introduce habits in your life that you will keep doing after you are as healthy as you want to be such as exercising minimum three times per week eat more low cal food such as salad when you are stomachhungry as opposed to low on energy and saying yes to and arranging activites diets as in magazine diets have almost no longterm impact lifestyle changes are by definition longterm so much room for activities
GetMotivated,not_removed,its all about the food well after exercise im and have trouble losing more i do physical work and burn thousands of calories hike up mountains on weekends but eat whatever so hope the doctor stresses good diet not just a diet but lifestyle changes do as i say not as i do exercise is useless if you dont eat right
GetMotivated,not_removed,good luck keep up with the workouts and slowly cut sugar and you will lose weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,please dont ruin your knees by running so much when overweight just eat less thats the most important part and if you want to so some physical activity maybe bike
GetMotivated,not_removed,i suggest you give rketo a moment of your time im ve similarly cut out since early may you have already cut out bread and beer cheese is worth keeping though good work on the cutting
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry to hear about your friend im glad you are making the change for the bettershit i need to make the change myself
GetMotivated,not_removed,great way to honor a lost friend im sure he would be proud as fuck just like me keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,can you suggest some juicing recipies thanks

GetMotivated,not_removed,hey good for you take it one day at a time september is going to roll around anyway might as well be at your goal weight when it doesall the best to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,condolences on losing your best friend and good on you for deciding to get in shape i just wanted to chime in with one bit of advice ditch the light weights and go as heavy as you can safely go with strict form light weights while cuttingdropping weight wont be as effective in keeping or increasing muscle mass than heavier weights not to mention the added metabolic boost of heavy weight compound exercises good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats really good keep it up i know it can be easy to slack off but its totally going to be worth it im guessing youre already seeing some of the benefits considering the weight that you lost it only gets better and it gets easier the more you do it i dont know you but im really proud of you
GetMotivated,not_removed,miles a day for days with pounds thats impressive
GetMotivated,not_removed,im so sorry for your loss but im very proud of you i really admire your commitment to bettering yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,my greatest respect to you youre not allowing your friend to die in vain by bringing something positive from it youre giving yourself the love we all should give ourselves and youre inspiring everyone around you and people youll never even know about stay the course
GetMotivated,not_removed,greetings i recently suffered my own loss not a death of a person fortunately but the end of my marriage so i understand i am sorry for your loss i decided to start riding a bike the results have been amazing really astounding running especially when youre heavy can be very hard on your joints id like to suggest you try riding a bike ive been riding a mountain bike on roads rarely im very picky bikepaths and sidewalks and im getting to see a different side of things that you miss when youre whizzing by in a car running is working for you right now and thats great i dont mean to dissuade you from what youve found that works i got my bike through craigslist and its been the best darn investment it was in rough shape but fixing it was inexpensive and maintenance is very reasonable good luck keep up the good work good for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wish more people realized that losing weight is diet exercise but that is important too great progress good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,just by creating this post you are less likely to succeed by creating this post you have already given your mind the reward of losing weight to have the best rate of success you must tell no one and fight the fight against your body alone im sorry that is the way our minds work bring the down votes
GetMotivated,not_removed,check out rfitness if you havent already good job so far as others have stated its all about diet when trying to lose weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,no bread no potatoes no pasta youll lose weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,you rock you are inspiring and your friend would be really proud of you
GetMotivated,not_removed,bread beer and cheese why god why i gotta do this
GetMotivated,not_removed,we should connect i think we have very similar stories 😳🙌🏼❤️
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know if anyones mentioned it but i really dont recommend running days a week please switch some running days with cycling or the eliptical otherwise youll likely get some form of injury from overtraining source common sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,good for you keep pushing yourself to be healthy you start at zero everyday and its on you to end the day in the black no zero days
GetMotivated,not_removed,good on you keep at it man
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome thats a lot of running here is my patented weight loss system its similiar to your but more balanced i will run one day and weightlift the next rinse repeat always alternating i run about half hour miles on my run days and lift for hour i may take a day off a week really just listen to my body if i am tire sore or something hurts ill take a day even off until that part recovers fully this is important never lift or run if the body part being exercised feels weird or is strained for food i do chicken and rice lunch and dinner power bars for a snack coke zero water and a single glass of wine for drinkinggotta enjoy my winelol bits and pieces of food here and there is i feel really hungry ill substitute fishpastaveggies for their respective item pretty simple lost pounds on this diet i basically cycle from bulking to cutting yearly in bulking i eat way more and cut way down the cardio keep up the good work
GetMotivated,not_removed,hell of a way to pay tribute to your fallen brother best of luck on your journey
GetMotivated,not_removed,hell yeah man the first step is the hardest and youve taken that best of luck to you and condolences about your friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats your approach is working for me too im and mostly been around when im in shape trying to do it just by food choices now cut out alcohol sugar and bread simple carbs basically about halfway to where i want to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont have anything to add that others havent already but congrats on your progress and we are all behind you
GetMotivated,not_removed,good luck nothing feels better than doing something for your body im also trying to lose weight since january and feel much better now keep at it and you have my respect
GetMotivated,not_removed,op im really sorry for your loss after my mom beat breast cancer we did everything we could to get in shape and healthy so it wouldnt come back that was like years ago now im really happy you are going to take your health back good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,the best tribute you can give to your friend is to be healthy and live long and happy life for the both of you cut out drinks with sugar look on the back of a soda some have calories thats a waste of calories save those calories for a dessert after dinner one night super is the biggest enemy and sweat drinks are low hanging fruit drop those and watch the lbs fall off
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone who went from to i can tell you it can be done the key is consistency keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,your friend is definitely proud of you i am too
GetMotivated,not_removed,congrats man i completely understand how rough it can be i was and lbs at my worst not to mention asthmatic and prediabetic i had my own wakeup call at about march when i found out that i was body fat ive since then lost about lbs having gotten down to slightly less than lbs and at a healthy bmi though i still have a bit of a ways to go try to eat some nuts organic peanut butter olive oil and other healthy fats ive found that if you eat plenty of those your body gets primed to burn fat which helps a ton other than that get lots of protein with meat andor protein powder trust me losing muscle in place of fat seriously sucks finally never give up youre gonna have days when youre just absolutely done with this stuff i know i did just keep going and keep your head up and the rewards are going to be completely worth it for you just like they were for me good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,id take it a bit easier on the run unless you were some cross country champion in the days do more heavy lifts dl squats and they will help you with your run
GetMotivated,not_removed,im proud of you you are on the right track the number one killer in the united states is not police believe it or not its heart disease a lot of our health problems are self inflicted unfortunately our society promotes obesity in image
GetMotivated,not_removed,i used to weigh in may now i weigh and its all due to reducing my food intake just calculate your basal metabolic rate and then cut below those calories by about or so and stick to a strict limit it works wonders even without exercise
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not about what food to cut out but the calories you eat and burn use a tdee calculator and try to eat calories less than your maintenance good luck op
GetMotivated,not_removed,also check everything for sugar content really surprising what things it gets shovelled into every good luck to you and well done
GetMotivated,not_removed,run less at that weight you will fuck your knees up big time especially coming from what sounds like a low exercise lifestyle times a week of anything even for a fit person is a recipe for injury or burnout
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep your head up and try your best to enjoy this journey youre on i know your buddy would be hella proud
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep going you are inspirational
GetMotivated,not_removed,im proud of you your friend would be too keep up the good work and thank you for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,good for you man im glad you shared it keep up the great work youre a great role model your body and extended life will thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep at it man your doing great
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep going dont quit you owe it to yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,good for you stick with it i lost weight for my son a month after he was born i was im also i lost the baby weight in four months and another lbs in six months to just by counting calories and walking every day now im going to the gym every day for lifting and cardio the transformation is priceless im the best mom i can be for him you are doing great honor to your friends memory
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats excellent im heading down the same path im fat but otherwise ok still flexible dont smoke dont drink to excess its hard to change habits my main weakness is eating after dinner i havent done that for three nights now and ive already lost weight of course some of that is water my main thing is trying to replace bad habits with good playing pokémon go with my wife and kids has been a great excuse to walk around the neighborhood at night instead of sitting on the couch and eating chips i know its a silly game but anything is better than sitting on the couch keep us updated
GetMotivated,not_removed,its unfortunate that a lot of people have to lose someone to get the wake up call my dad passed away a few years back he had diabetes and many other ailments that were only complicated by diabetes scared the shit out me and i did the same thing lost over pounds and started running marathons i dont miss the weight but i miss my dad
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am sorry for your loss but good job getting motivated to lose weight i am in the same boat i weigh pounds but cant get motivated you inspire me
GetMotivated,not_removed,unfortunately this story reminds me of why i decided to finally get healthier my sister passed from pancreatitis and her eating and drinking habits certainly did not help this unexpected illness my mother had some unhealthy habits as well in the past fast forward to now my mother has lost a shit ton of weight from eating healthy whole foods no shit fad diets anymore she even gave up diet soda like i begged her to for years i have also become much more healthy eating better stopped smoking cigs people in my family still dont understand why i refuse to eat certain ways and indulge with them my one friend was actually pissed i wouldnt eat ice cream with her even after explaining how it makes my stomach hurt dammit sometimes misery loves company sometimes it takes a huge event or tragedy to spark change im sorry to hear about your friend keep pushing forward especially if anyone tries to discourage you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you could really benefit from skipping the long easytodislike runs and shift more toward full body workouts anything like a crossfit program or just a program you can find on bodybuildingcom forums would both help you lose lots of weight but also pack on some muscle nothing keeps your metabolism up quite like hungry muscles not to mention while you are motivated by the increasing amount of weight lose you will also see lots of great muscle definition and you will find your quality of life increasing dramatically since you can get lots of angry energy converted into moving that iron
GetMotivated,not_removed,stay vigilant op
GetMotivated,not_removed,great job and tribute i think you will inspire others you can do it keep it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,such a sad yet inspiring story this will give me even more motivaton sorry for your loss
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are getting some great advice and some conflicting advice as well so here is some more dont let the people tell you running is bad fuck that maybe dont full force or throw is some walking but you are not going to get hurt by running many people are saying your diet is key and while that is true dont let them try and make light of the exercise it will help out way more than people here are trying to say fuck the notion that it wont run and lift dont do light lifting go as heavy safely obviously as you can always try to keep pushing yourself always if you do this you can more than likely go past your mark by jan
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep going my friend so proud of you you are a bad ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is great congratulations as a registered dietitian i would like to advise you that there is no reason to cut out entire foods like bread or cheese even beer can fit into a wellrounded diet
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry for your loss cutting out these foods makes sense but what would be better is making a log of your activity and what you eat for example using an app like myfitnesspal
GetMotivated,not_removed,fucking beer man i wish there was a diet that let you drink ill just give up everything carby and keep my beer will that work i heard a pack was the equivalent to a loaf of bread
GetMotivated,not_removed,try to
GetMotivated,not_removed,try to yay i corrected somebodys grammatical mistake am i more intelligent now
GetMotivated,not_removed,so true mr dickhead so very true
GetMotivated,not_removed,congratulations i work in an office that has a lot of yummy treats brought in that can be hard to resist one thing that really helps me is telling myself this is not the last cookie you will have an opportunity to eat
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep us posted on your progress
GetMotivated,not_removed,seriously check out keto for many people it totally kills overeating
GetMotivated,not_removed,its borderline unhealthy for someone that weightsedentary takes a long time to work up to it work up to it brah
GetMotivated,not_removed,not to be a jerk or anything but i can run in about or less if anything op is getting the minimum recommended amount of exercise a day i often do routines back to backchest and back shoulders and arms which takes about thats a lot of exercise op could always do more as they get healthier but running days a week aint much in the larger scheme of things hell i probably walk a day at work so it only seems like a lot if you have a sedentary lifestyle
GetMotivated,not_removed,i just want to say that although your lengthy positive post about being healthy appears to be a good thing the thing that is causing me to write this is that you state your are eating less than calories a day i would like to say that you are currently in starvation mode yes you see results quickly with the weight just falling off but you are actually burning more muscle than fat you are becoming lighter but actually this is an extremely unhealthy and unsustainable lifestyle if i had to compare it to something it would only be slightly better than being anorexic what you should be doing is this eating more working out more keep your caloric intake between make sure that you are eating a heavy protein breakfast itll help curb the hunger pains you likely feel mid morning and also burn this instead of your muscles for energy dont skip on the fats or carbs either again dont starve your body an example of my daily meals is as follows breakfast cup whole milk cup chocolate milk scoop whey protein isolate cake donut is delicious calories lunch deli sandwich with lots of meat with cheese mayo the works calories dinner protein shake currently having the mango protein naked juice calories and protein bar calories total for the day is roughly im also active running softball hiking weight training etc yes its a lot of protein but also contains carbs and fat im not a body builder not do i claim to be however ive lost this way and have doubled the amount i can lift pants size from a to im also from down to was it hard yes are there days where i eat what i want yes again i appreciate your comment and hour others can gain from it i just wanted to let people know that there are still other ways to lose weight and become healthy stay healthy my friends
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you have any linkstips to share as far as juicing recipes go this sounds interesting to try
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for all the advice everyone would switching to the elliptical take some stress off my joints while still maintaining a lot of cardio im trying to build my stamina up and have taken all the excellent points into consideration
GetMotivated,not_removed,same height at i do a day and my knees always feel like they want to escape from my body after i take fish oil and a joint soother but if i tried miles i think my kneecaps would explode and id end up like the grandpa from king of the hill
GetMotivated,not_removed,i totally understand that mentality which is why i havent really made a point to discuss with friends ive learned some great tips in this anonymous internet message board but i do support your theory the more i talk about it the less likely i am to find the personal satisfaction of the result
GetMotivated,not_removed,no he wasnt holding me back our weights sort of fluctuated together ive tried to lose weight before but always got bored of an exercise and diet regime after a few weeks im not sure if you are trying to troll or not but i would never say he was holding me back his death gave me the push to pursue something we had often talked about together
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think we can all agree bread and beer can be completely cut out of someones diet and that would be nothing but positive
GetMotivated,not_removed,marvello the amazing grammar mouse
GetMotivated,not_removed,reddit is weird in a hilarious yet heartwarming way
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like that mindset a few ideas that might help too try bringing in your own healthier snacks too have carrot sticks or apples or something handy all the time or gum its a surprisingly effective appetite suppressant and drink lots of water its easiest to slip up when youre hungry
GetMotivated,not_removed,what sucks is sometimes i dont cheat due to a breaking of my own will or just a little cheat or something sometimes the cheat comes as a result of having taken a little too much insulin and my blood sugar is crashing causing me to shake and legs turn to jello when youre avoiding carbs and your sugar crashes youre about to eat carbs to bring your sugar up thats the bottom line happened to me today in fact and my emergency food is skittles a because it hits the blood stream quickly and b i really really dont like them so im never tempted to eat them but as an emergency food but its a big load of carbs nonetheless
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the key word too progress screw up and a craving turns into eating something i shouldnt doesnt mean throw it all away and forget it some people myself included just couldnt forgive myself if i screwed up even a little thats how i was with language learning too which has had me start and stop languages so many times trick is to push through the mistakes because the goalpost hasnt moved
GetMotivated,not_removed,considering op seems to have started less than two months ago its great progress no need to put them down by saying that what theyre doing isnt much
GetMotivated,not_removed,humblebraggington
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone who was only poundsnot even super obese but rather simply overweight i couldnt even run mile without being completely out of breathe so when i read he weighted more than me and ran almost twice as much as me i knew he was running a lot but i wanted to remind him that all that hard work although really good can be amplified with a good diet the fact that he is even going outside at all at that weight to me is surprising and shouldnt be immediately compared to people who run marathons after doing a quick google search and seeing how long it takes people generally to run it seems like only healthy people can run at your pace and walking miles a day doesnt mean much tbh when i was overweight i prefered to walk miles a day walking around wonderland and shopping with friends than running mile youre talking from a healthy persons perspective and im seeing it from an overweight perspective no need to be nitpicking what is normal and what isnt when he is clearly doing above and beyond what an overweight person would normally be doing which would have been staying the same and not going outside at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,i understand and agree with a lot of your post ive read a lot of the same literature and stuff on avoid catabolizing your muscles and dropping your metabolism when losing weight i used to be very into weight lifting and body buildingusing that term loosely as i never tried competing when i was in college but in practice that just doesnt seem to be how its working i rarely feel hunger pangs and i never feel like im starving myself i dont count my calories but my guess was below on an average day my food intake is something like this in the morning oz of my juice hours later oz oz hours later cal hours later on whey protein cal and then ill have maybe another oz of cashews over the day while snacking or cashews here and cal so about calories somedays its probably like i never feel like im starving myself though if i bike or workout i tend to have an extra protein shake and some nuts so i really dont think im putting my body in starvation mode at this point if i were working out a lot lifting swimming biking days a week i would be breaking down muscle and probably losing it somewhat due to not having enough calories to replace it but while working out days a week and doing exercises that arent damaging my muscles im not really putting my body in that state i had lbs of fat to burn as fuel and that seems to be what my body is burning my strength is the same maybe a little stronger in somethings like swimming and biking my endurance has gone up a lot and i dont get exhausted as easily i think what ill probably do to avoid crashing my metabolism is that when i get down to lobs and only have lbs left to lose ill very slowly increase my calorie intake since those last are the most stubborn and where you have to kick up the working out a notch and this is where you are most likely to burn the most muscle thats what i did when i was in college and bulked and then cut to put on muscle mass and it worked really well for me went from to then down to a lean over a year
GetMotivated,not_removed,starvation mode is not a real thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah running is not very good if you are overweight your knees will get malmed down and when oyu are older you will probably have terrible knees i tried to run when i had at and it felt like the basketball knee burst scene in southpark
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow i feel like a complete ass cuz i was trynna troll i was high when i typed that so yea my bad
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with cutting it out but there is a stigma attached to bread and carbs as if they are some horrible entity bread can be part of a healthy diet
GetMotivated,not_removed,no no we can not all agree for me at this point and time beer is a great motivator i put my ass on a bike and tell myself in miles you can have a beer sometimes i say in miles in a few days im putting the number at miles metric halfcentury there is nothing more satisfying to me at this time than chugging a frosty cold coppery ale sometimes though i have to settle for a pilsner or a lager and thats ok beer bike happy me
GetMotivated,not_removed,stick with it man setbacks are natural just saw a video from bjorn hafthorsguy the guy that plays the mountain and he said ice cream is his favorite cheat food and he eats it almost every day lol just make the better decisions as often as you can and realize youre only human when you slip i think youre making a smart move in regard to exercise when you are ready to exercise you might think about swimming first as its low stress on the body good luck and keep me posted im in the same boat with ya bud
GetMotivated,not_removed,can i get an on the difference between keto and paleo not being facetious im genuinely curious i did keto and lost lbs wondering if to lose that last and to tone up if the switch might be beneficial
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not though op is doing what they should do what we all should do i was only responding to the person saying it was a lot of exercise its not two different things i am happy for op and i hope they continue to push themselves to reach their full potential in honor of their friend but i didnt want people to think that a day is a lot and possibly deter people from trying to push themselves im all about selfimprovement but i know some people get overwhelmed by what others consider a lot
GetMotivated,not_removed,gunnery sgt knees pretty common in the marine corps for senior enlisted to need knee surgery from running in boots so much at least im working towards making my runs lighter at the same time
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would stick to keto and commit to or revise your exercise routine i want to lose another kilos by the end of summer and be as fit as i can be just signed up with a great trainer and in combination with keto i know i can get there what youve done has worked changing to paleo seems a bit drastic i know the food can get a bit samey but i make an effort to cook something special every so often
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone answer this man
GetMotivated,not_removed,at a glance i look healthy im short with a small to average build but it would take me months to be able to run or really jog miles much less i did gymnastics and other active pursuits consistently growing up but im just not athletic and because of that i never saw great strides being made which makes it really hard to maintain motivation if im pushing myself i get discouraged dont know why i suck at anything sportsy and feel so overwhelmed at the prospect of how long it will take feeling defeated before some benefits kick in however if i give myself an easy task im much more likely to actually get out and do it and tough love yeah no that will piss me off to the point that i just quit in contrast my bf and i decided we were going to start working out he hopped on the treadmill and ran two miles this was following years of lots of video games netflix and alcohol i was so pissed because i knew there was no way i could do that even though id at least tried to take up exercise at various points in our relationship i dont think anyone will be deterred from pushing themselves by saying miles is a lot of exercise if anything if i heard wow thats a lot of exercise you are getting i would feel so pumped that id want to do more hearing that its not a lot of exercise makes me feel like well if running for minutes is nothing to feel that accomplished over screw it
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should take a lot of stairs or go cycling or go swimming or run slowly with soft and feathered stepping although at isnt that extreme i weight a bit more at and i dont have any problems with my knees mostly my cardioheart strength is the main problem maybe you need better shoes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree the paleo thing seems a little gimmicky its no surprise its proven to be a controversial approach to nutrition
GetMotivated,not_removed,they evolved to die at and didnt have modern science and medicine to inform their eating habits there is a lot illogical about it but it could turn out that modern medicine validates it it would just be a miracle
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you i had no idea that paleo is purported to help with autoimmune conditions i was diagnosed with ms almost a year ago and the medication doesnt seem to help much it may be worth a try in my case as well i plan on looking into it further i very much appreciate the input
GetMotivated,not_removed,charles duhigg of the power of habit wrote this piece back in but its still good httpcharlesduhiggcomgotanewyearsresolutionhereshowtomakeitstick
GetMotivated,not_removed,find what you want and go for it what is it that makes you smile what makes you look forward to the next day give yourself a long term goal to work towards and focus on achieving it one thing at a time you can do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not an expert but it sounds like fear is whats holding you back more than laziness try taking some walks or trips into a natural setting a forest or field or hills somewhere without many people think about what you actually want what you actually enjoy and what fears are holding you back from it identify something you can do to improve your life something small that you can do now and do that tomorrow find something else and do that just fixing the little things can feel awfully good
GetMotivated,not_removed,you just have to go for it seeing a psychologist is the first step buy a few self help books that seem to reflect your situation and read them drink coffee after each read and do something research careers youre interested in and enroll in school start working out and look for a part time job itll take a bit of time but remember that each hour you put into productive improvement is a step in the right direction know that you can achieve your goal there is nothing stopping you nothing but yourself right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,seek a professional you trust for your depression and go every week get this under control first do not stop searching until you find a professional to help you weekly pick one area in your life to get together at a time what do you want to focus on first finding a job losing weight or instilling habits that just make you feel good only focus on one thing at a time one thing that you really really aremotivated to changing no matter how small it could be as small as i will have painted nails every day or im eating serving of fruit every day whatever small thing that would make your life better for me i started out with organizing my finances yes even though i was making just a month from a part time gig i bought a wallet i really liked tried a lot of my creative ideas and after months of trial and error got down a technique that is working for me next my dental health im in a situation where i am unable to afford the dentist for a bit i knew of a book called kiss your dentist goodbye and decided to apply her regimen ive been doing it every single day ideally twice a day but working on it for a while i cant believe how incredible my mouth feels every single day as i successfully get these little aspects of my life in order i feel more and more motivated

GetMotivated,not_removed,how many foreigners do you house
GetMotivated,not_removed,so basically where there are higher concentrations of white people xd
GetMotivated,not_removed,you might want to read about who was turned away at ellis island years ago
GetMotivated,not_removed,how many are on welfare
GetMotivated,not_removed,basically the countries that make up the to list of best countries to live in every year yes they have higher concentrations of white people are you trying to imply something does it make you feel bad that all the best countries to live in are largely made up of white people
GetMotivated,not_removed,government funded schools
GetMotivated,not_removed,not at all im mainly talking about
GetMotivated,not_removed,everyones laughing when do i win again
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah but you win by nuclear war so i wouldnt call that much of a win
GetMotivated,not_removed,did gandhi really say that
GetMotivated,not_removed,he was no saint
GetMotivated,not_removed,what
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats certainly food for thought
GetMotivated,not_removed,then i nuke you
GetMotivated,not_removed,he said that before nuking
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you 😊 its true right
GetMotivated,not_removed,but when you dont win they laugh more circle of life
GetMotivated,not_removed,i remember everyone laughed when i told them i wanted to be a stand up comedian well theyre not laughing now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you have to fight them or something
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think you have to fight them or something
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think knowledge is power the perks of doing research and what not to figure out a balace in everything i have worked too many jobs cause i get bored easy and knowledge gives me the ability to move up past the bullshit i mean money makes the world go round so so i guess you start by laughing with them at first and then little by little you start making fun on their stupiditythen after that you teach them and then they stop laughing at you cause then the see you as a hollywood starlol
GetMotivated,not_removed,gandhi literally nuked me in my last game and i thought we were on good terms
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not sure but personally i suspect its photoshopped
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were on good terms then the underflow joke kicked in and then nukes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant not ask about the tattoo
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow insane congratulations and looking good
GetMotivated,not_removed,the proof that everything is possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,often times i see these before pictures and think damn i wish they wouldve just chosen another drug whether that drug was cycling hours a day smoking weed all day or a porn addiction anything wouldve been better than encasing themselves in a self imposed prison the scars from which theyll never escape you can see the emotional distress truly unfortunate
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats awesome keep up the good work
GetMotivated,not_removed,love the white trash tattoo
GetMotivated,not_removed,white trash
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok not meth heroin pills alcohol k felt like i didnt need to mention that as the thrust of what i was saying didnt warrant it
GetMotivated,not_removed,he couldve become addicted to lifting steroids and ephedrine wouldve been better lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you lazy or are you demoralized should we really blame ourselves we each have the potential for greatness
GetMotivated,not_removed,that dudes pretty smart he should consider running for president
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually true haha you can be lazy and fuck around all you want without caring if you work hard or not it will eventually backfire
GetMotivated,not_removed,people create societies so people need to change them but we dont have to buy what is being sold education needs radical change imo
GetMotivated,not_removed,huh thanks for that article puts some things into perspective and it is a little uplifting to be able to pin some responsibility for perceived laziness on external factors which then become things we can seek to change its not that one is just a bad lazy human its that weve been treated wrong and were never taught a healthy sustainable way to behave
GetMotivated,not_removed,but how does anyone make those changes there is no standard for acceptable behavior the idea of television as ritual it started more innocently youre not worried about broadcasting porn or violent film when youve just made tv available wonder is ritual then it decays to wondering at at stupidity disgust etc its just a medium of social discourse increasingly selling a standardless and unoriginal narrative gays violence fashion etc entertainment now the definition of low art more john waters than we realize

GetMotivated,not_removed,ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,glad you enjoyed it thanks for watching
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for watching greatly appreciate it
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a big fan of challenge your thinking with dr linda tucker which was just featured by itunes today the first two episodes are amazing also the episode with bradley charbonneau is great about changing habits
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a big fan of zig ziglar he has a podcast thats pretty good you may want to go way back and download the old ones the current episodes are a mix of things by zig and then an episode with another speaker about their work
GetMotivated,not_removed,great idea i use audio sources all the time for motivation and learning some of the podcasts i love listening to specifically for motivation httpbeyondthetodolistcom httpwwwgeoffwoodscompodcasts httphalelrodcompodcast httpsmichaelhyattcomthisisyourlife these are my top ones but there are many more my first podcast was miracle and that was a springboard for me he interviews a lot of motivational people who have their own podcasts and ive branched out from there one of the best episodes was his i still remember first hearing it over a year ago side note i love eric thomas he has a youtube channel that is really motivational was my introduction to him extremely motivational he has a youtube series called tgim thank god its monday about min videos there are also a ton of other random videos that people have stitched together on youtube that are also very motivational dont ignore your local library there are tons of resources at any library that you can use audiobooks on cd on playaways essentially an player that has a book on it you supply headphones and batteries and online i was very surprised at the online selection which is called overdrive some authors that i love with audiobooks tony robbins jim rohn zig ziglar brian tracy les brown audio is an incredible way to get motivated and to learn new things i commute about minutes per day and i always listen to audiobooks i get through about cd per day typically a book every week or two when im doing housework im listening to podcasts its a great way to make the time pass faster but also make great use of it best of luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for a recommendations

GetMotivated,not_removed,perfect when i started listening to him he didnt have one yet awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats so wrong about sleeping on a futon at plenty people in japan do
GetMotivated,not_removed,buddhism the art of being content with nothing while reflecting on all you have
GetMotivated,not_removed,httpzenpencilscom
GetMotivated,not_removed,comparison is the thief of joy just live your life
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive always found it funny that this poem is often quoted as an illustration of the power of individual choices and the need to make decisive life defining decisions however frost always intended it as a tongue in cheek look at decisions that in the end you will always sigh and wonder what was down the other road no matter which one you took so really it made no difference at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,my takeaway from this is that no matter the road you take you will always end up in a place where you reflect back on all that was and all that might have been so if the destination is always going to be the same dont fret over the road to take or worry about the one youre already on
GetMotivated,not_removed,its nice to see someone getting this poem right for a change
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is beautiful i had a moment of clarity thank you for posting this
GetMotivated,not_removed,robert frost is a family favorite my mom used his poem birches every day when she lost twin boys she read it over and over when she was fighting depression hes amazing with words
GetMotivated,not_removed,they convenientely didnt explain that step where you go from working in a kitchen in brazil to being able to afford clothes
GetMotivated,not_removed,you always die alone
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the right path he marries the first woman he meets in the second path he doesnt also no kids conclusion never go to uni
GetMotivated,not_removed,zen pencils are good for this kind of thing i rather liked
GetMotivated,not_removed,soooo go to college otherwise youll die alone
GetMotivated,not_removed,my favorite poem thanks op
GetMotivated,not_removed,very nice lovely graphics and philosopy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dunno the one of the left red doesnt have to deal with a baby and got a dog i feel like this is the better option for happiness
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont compare what you have with everything else just express gratitude for what you have right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow that comic completely changed my perception of the poem i always thought that he meant that you should take the road less travelled but reading it now it sounds like the only difference was that it was less travelled and not that it actually changed his life
GetMotivated,not_removed,you just have to assume youd have been happy either way
GetMotivated,not_removed,you could live both if youre rich
GetMotivated,not_removed,im completely native to the english language but literally cant understand anything of that whats happening
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe people will quit using this in reference taking the high road now frost was saying it didnt matter which road he took he just took the one he would gain the most insight from
GetMotivated,not_removed,bout to ruin the poem for yall with
GetMotivated,not_removed,moral of the story we all die alone
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think i have black grass very little seems to go well i at least have cats
GetMotivated,not_removed,fucking depressing theres no point
GetMotivated,not_removed,by the time he wrote this he was both a successful writer and in the middle of an interesting life a life so interesting that we know a lot about it years after it began most people dont get that so a little comparison and aspiration is not only natural but healthy that being said considering the fates of most of his children and other issues during his life i can be almost completely sure that mr frost wished that parts of it could have been much less interesting
GetMotivated,not_removed,do people who can identify with one of those ways prefer the other while looking at this picture
GetMotivated,not_removed,brazil is truly a life changer
GetMotivated,not_removed,i recently saw this somewhere else and the first comment said which one did he take
GetMotivated,not_removed,can someone care to explain this graphic i dont get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,but which road did he take he seems a lot happier having taken the red road
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think i read this poem in grade
GetMotivated,not_removed,roy a life well lived
GetMotivated,not_removed,how do you get a job if you dont go to college the red path couldve gone wrong lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,well the guy on the right has kids so his genetic like is being passed on more successful lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,completely off topic but i like how your username references xfiles while im watching it just before netflix removes it
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly
GetMotivated,not_removed,tell that to the typical asian parents look at so and sowith his big job and big house and big blah blah fking blahthank god i have one stoic parent at least
GetMotivated,not_removed,but the cops keep bothering me i wish they would just leave me alone
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hate linkedin for this
GetMotivated,not_removed,and yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,we humans love our stories its romantic to think of the what ifs
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive always wanted some sort od machine that would let me see the what if scenarios then i thought if it would truly be smart look at that or to live my life and now im sitting here contemplating my mortalityim gonna need a snack
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i was my english teacher id say authorial intent is not important what matters is what the reader interprets in the poem
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was his intent he basically wrote it with that very idea in mind but his friend that he wrote it for misinterpreted it in the way most people do so he joined the military i believe he was quite old to do so as well during a major war and died in said war at least thats the story i heard
GetMotivated,not_removed,reminded me of a saying i once screwed up judge if you want we are all going to die i intend to have earned it
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i guess it all depends on what makes you happy it seems he was happy either way just reached happiness from different paths
GetMotivated,not_removed,exactly
GetMotivated,not_removed,basically its saying to appreciate the life youve created and the choices youve made rather than always wishing and wondering for what could have been since you could end up doing the same thing if you had a different life anyway
GetMotivated,not_removed,right i could go for a trip to brasil or a nice wellpaying job this just makes me jealous of two other peoples happy lives im pretty sure i couldve made different decisions in my past and wound up a vastly happier person but not dwelling on that i think is the intended takeaway
GetMotivated,not_removed,the point is that there are many ways to be happy
GetMotivated,not_removed,may you live in interesting times commonly used curse of the counterweight continent
GetMotivated,not_removed,basically its saying to just appreciate the life youve created rather than wasting time and energy on wishingwondering about what could have been because chances are youd end up doing the same thing if you had a different life
GetMotivated,not_removed,it doesnt matter both paths are the same there is no road less traveled
GetMotivated,not_removed,or maybe the guy on the left left a body of work about cooking and travel that influenced generations of people shakespeare and jesus and dear abby didnt have kids but influenced millions as a parent who adopted nurture is more important than genetics
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you watching it for the first time ive watched it about times through i didnt know it was leaving netflix thats terrible

GetMotivated,not_removed,my relationship with a chinese girl is coming to an end these days almost specifically because im not successful and connected enough and i thought she wanted me for me
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is difficult but this made it easier for me i read somewhere you should only compare yourself to your past self comparing is kind of a natural human instinct and you can always find a missed opportunity or somebody else thats better than you at something the possibilities are endless but ask yourself are you in a better place than you were last year according to your own desires and beliefs yes good if not what are you going to do about it
GetMotivated,not_removed,okay and what do i do if life isnt happy and no divergent road yields apparant happiness asking for a friend
GetMotivated,not_removed,you misinterpreted the word grass here bro
GetMotivated,not_removed,but
GetMotivated,not_removed,people are probabalistic the decisions made will always be made from something however faint the interesting part comes in the seemingly infinite opportunities that were ever really only a few mirrored a million ways repeated endlessly
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow hit the nail on the head
GetMotivated,not_removed,watch the family man thought it was a great underrated movie back in that is exactly this
GetMotivated,not_removed,sort of like the what if machine in futurama
GetMotivated,not_removed,read it again champ i spent almost a whole semester of nothing but frost whatever you take away from it is fine but thats clearly what it says the grass is greener has nothing to do with it except for the title of the post the picture at the end with the guys sitting exactly the same is the whole point it doesnt matter which you take and hed have taken both if he could
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know right and i was only on

GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a good one thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,however

GetMotivated,not_removed,whomever
GetMotivated,not_removed,whatsoever
GetMotivated,not_removed,wrong community 😂
GetMotivated,not_removed,as youtube comment well says i know people are gonna call me stupid for this but i dont care i think this is actually really inspirational﻿
GetMotivated,not_removed,tomorrow never comes so do right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,its as funny as much as it is inspirational not in a bad way
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought that was a melania trump quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you for posting happy to read about shirley chisholm for the first time interesting and inspiring
GetMotivated,not_removed,k
GetMotivated,not_removed,this saturday shirley chrisholm takes on the undertaker at summer slaaaaaam you paid for the whole seat but you only need the edge
GetMotivated,not_removed,id prefer to take a computer chair
GetMotivated,not_removed,looks like michael jordan
GetMotivated,not_removed,seems like advice for a party crashee
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is dumb
GetMotivated,not_removed,first black congresswoman is as sassy as i expected
GetMotivated,not_removed,looks like denzel washington
GetMotivated,not_removed,ill get my own table with hookers and blackjack in fact forget the table
GetMotivated,not_removed,ehhh ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not entitled to sit at anyones table
GetMotivated,not_removed,who is this eggplant
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,if they clearly dont want you there why would you force yourself into their lives leave them alone this quote is for the weirdo people who sit their and try to converse with you when you clearly want nothing to do with them
GetMotivated,not_removed,make jim crow great again wait wut
GetMotivated,not_removed,took a double take and the pic genuinely does look like michael jordan lol edit the downvotes have convinced me that this does not look like michael jordan in a wig
GetMotivated,not_removed,almost like the quote isnt meant to be taken literally
GetMotivated,not_removed,she was the first african american woman to be elected to hold a seat in congress the point is that the established order will resist change so you must go beyond it to get anything done
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mean you dont carry a folding chair everywhere you go pleb
GetMotivated,not_removed,and the blackjack
GetMotivated,not_removed,good peasant now get back to work
GetMotivated,not_removed,a seat at the table usually refers to a group of people with the power to make decisions affecting others its nothing whatsoever to do with social situations
GetMotivated,not_removed,you realize youre talking about the plutocrats that actually rule this country right peasant youre defending their right to exclude and marginalize you which they have
GetMotivated,not_removed,screw you man only jerks demand to be included where they arent wanted and only idiots want to be around people who dont like them only children want respect they havent earned
GetMotivated,not_removed,so whats the chair for
GetMotivated,not_removed,screw you man this is really funny to me because your original comment in the context of this post is basically screw me man
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone has high sodium levels
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a metaphor just because you dont have a seat at the table doesnt you cant find a way to be seated ie by bringing a chair i think its meant to represent finding creative doityourself solutions when faced with obstacles
GetMotivated,not_removed,it represents creating your own opportunities
GetMotivated,not_removed,to sit in i honestly dont understand whats confusing you
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats a scale
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry thats a typo the is just a page number
GetMotivated,not_removed,you accidentally typed a page number
GetMotivated,not_removed,edna mode and guest
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont look back youre not going that wayragnar lothbrok
GetMotivated,not_removed,no cape
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant wait for the sequel oh wait yeah i can years
GetMotivated,not_removed,luck favors the prepared
GetMotivated,not_removed,when you get sad you run straight ahead and you keep running forward no matter what there are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back slow you down but you dont let them dont you stop running and dont you ever look behind you theres nothing for you behind you all that exists is whats ahead
GetMotivated,not_removed,this movie was legendary
GetMotivated,not_removed,helen dahhhling
GetMotivated,not_removed,edna mode engaged
GetMotivated,not_removed,one of my late mothers favorite quotes
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i was i had no clue what egyptian cotton wasnow it is the standard for my summer bedsheets
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you didnt read this in ednas voice youre lying darling
GetMotivated,not_removed,wait her last name is mode i always thought it was just the mode that the security system goes into once edna is in the room and she literally needs to say edna mode to disengage the system
GetMotivated,not_removed,i looked back today what to do
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive always got conflicting feelings on the posts like these if you dont look back at least a little you cant learn from your mistakes if you dont look forward at least a little you cant prepare for whats coming stay in the now but do what analysis or planning that is appropriate in the now dont dwell on mistakes decide what the right correction is for each one keep the correction then let the mistake go dont dwell on plans make a plan only if its likely to be helpful and be ready to let it go at a moments notice staying in the now doesnt mean making yourself blind to other points in time just look at them from the now
GetMotivated,not_removed,i member
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,came for an edna mode meme now leaving disappointed
GetMotivated,not_removed,this works in edinamode too
GetMotivated,not_removed,that looks like one of those texts that was stopped before it was finished probably by something behind them that ate them
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if the now is looking back
GetMotivated,not_removed,rtitlegore
GetMotivated,not_removed,had a misunderstanding with a good friend of mine last year tried to say sorry but i guess that wasnt enough to fix everything thats wrong i got this quote as a response instead and thats that we dont talk no more only one ive met who didnt judge at least didnt say it out loud and someone who i can be easy and comfortable around with i guess i still have my demons to work through though woulda been nice having someone by my side to support and cheer on i understand your reason to leave im not an easy person to tolerate much less to truly accept as a wholesome human being i wouldnt have stayed for me either miss you buddy saying this to make my peace and explain why i resent this quote so much🤗🤗🤗 no direspect to op though haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should look back sometimes just dont dwell on the past
GetMotivated,not_removed,not to live in the past but looking back can be very helpful even necessary allows you to appreciate where youve come from and what is worth remembering
GetMotivated,not_removed,was this before or after she looked back on all the superheroes who died because of capes and as a result doesnt use capes in the incredibles outfits she was just saving face when she didnt recognise her own work its a sign of her big headedness her head is even cartoonishly huge
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes words are useless gobble gobble gobble
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would totally crash the mode
GetMotivated,not_removed,what is edna
GetMotivated,not_removed,my soul slides away but dont look back in anger i heard you say
GetMotivated,not_removed,too late fifteen years too late
GetMotivated,not_removed,as robin said preparation is the prerequisite to victory
GetMotivated,not_removed,always liked that one
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a better saying imo she clearly looks back when she doesnt add capes to her new costumes anyway
GetMotivated,not_removed,it was essentially fantastic done right cant wait for the sequel
GetMotivated,not_removed,so hi res 😱
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry for your loss a great quote for us to remember
GetMotivated,not_removed,her last name is mode mode is also the german word for fashion but thats probably a coincidence her last name is a injoke one of the programs pixar uses to make films is called emode httppixarwikiacomwikiednamode
GetMotivated,not_removed,smile theres a reason you did things in the past you control your future so stop looking back and look ahead
GetMotivated,not_removed,i completely agree the past is so important for moving forward i used to block out anything bad that happened to me and it all came back to bite me in the ass recently ive started looking back and accepting those things that happened and letting myself feel the pain and its helped tremendously the key is not living in the past
GetMotivated,not_removed,no capes
GetMotivated,not_removed,its from the incredibles
GetMotivated,not_removed,a heroine of the tallest order of servility and professionalism she is a looming figure
GetMotivated,not_removed,scarred him for life
GetMotivated,not_removed,buddy
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if the sequel is being released years after
GetMotivated,not_removed,well it could be argued that she was looking back but only for emphasis on a point she already knew she believed that compilation of flashbacks is why she says no capes but she doesnt dwell on it it was a mistake from her past and she did something about it which was establishing the rule of no capes and ultimately had moved on
GetMotivated,not_removed,bojack horseman hint the guy who said it committed suicide within a month
GetMotivated,not_removed,bojack horseman
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,errrrrrrrrrrr i should use paint right
GetMotivated,not_removed,i love how syndrome dies because of his cape too
GetMotivated,not_removed,no drapes
GetMotivated,not_removed,it can be hard trying to stand out when youre in her shadow as the best designer of hero and heroine attire that was practical for each individuals powers she was a colossus in ingenuity i mean did you she what she put together for jackjack
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know there are those who think little of her
GetMotivated,not_removed,my name is not buddy and its not incrediboy either that ship has sailed all i wanted was to help you i only wanted to help and what did you say to me ive seen this movie too many times
GetMotivated,not_removed,you read my mind it would be fucking rad
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you werent aware theres a theory that she made his costume with that in mind by supercarlinbrothers httpsyoutubekvzflgavok that video isnt so much about that but it does propose it and it makes sense to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,no vapes
GetMotivated,not_removed,you cant be seen in this darling its a hobo suit
GetMotivated,not_removed,as tall an order it was to design for a superhero still in infancy with powers undiscovered she rose highly to the task demonstrating she could stand tall over anything consider her normal worldly life designing for the nonsuper clientele that wouldnt challenge her to her highest limits i wouldnt be short of disgust
GetMotivated,not_removed,at least he looked cute
GetMotivated,not_removed,its easily one of my favorite movies just watched it again weeks ago haha
GetMotivated,not_removed,urggghhhhh
GetMotivated,not_removed,it never occurred to me that she probably made his costume too
GetMotivated,not_removed,no grapes
GetMotivated,not_removed,sneakily pulls suit out of trash can
GetMotivated,not_removed,right my mind was blown
GetMotivated,not_removed,no crepes
GetMotivated,not_removed,no dates
GetMotivated,not_removed,no apes cincinnati zoo
GetMotivated,not_removed,no lakes california
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre not going to miss it either
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats not true at all i was aiming to save the world but i ended up a process analyst like my dad i dont even know how it happened honestly i just always just did my best at what i was good at
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless you play hanzo
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless you use autoaim
GetMotivated,not_removed,like the lotto commercial something like odds are one in billion of winning but significantly higher if you dont play
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats not what wayne gretsky told me
GetMotivated,not_removed,does this mean its okay to eat limitless amount of strawberry soft serve ice cream
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes
GetMotivated,not_removed,not sure i agree with the manicure point tho otherwise all true also a real man builds stuff because thats harder but more rewarding a sissy tears stuff and people down
GetMotivated,not_removed,gently gives mum a kick on the bum 😊 i help
GetMotivated,not_removed,her mom did a great job and is in better shape than a lot of women younger she has the strength to save herself in a potential emergency situation that makes her a survivor folks
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have a flawless record of upvoting jessie graff
GetMotivated,not_removed,ugh cant we just teach her how to act on camera we can finally resolve the which actress should play superwoman debate in a heartbeat
GetMotivated,not_removed,well she already has me bet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i can barely do one and i was outdone by an old lady im gonna hit the gym right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,her dad is the drama teacher at my high school and he is honestly one of the nicest people im so happy for him and jessie they both deserve it
GetMotivated,not_removed,why does jessie graff look like httpsenwikipediaorgwikisteffigraf
GetMotivated,not_removed,jessie graff can motivate me to do pushups
GetMotivated,not_removed,she toe punched her fart box
GetMotivated,not_removed,is it just me or does her mom look alot like beth from amcs the walking dead like if she was a lot older
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty amazing there would be some things i certainly couldnt do while doing pullups smiling for one and pullups
GetMotivated,not_removed,her moms not in bad shape at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,why did i always assume she is steffi grafs daughter
GetMotivated,not_removed,why is this hot to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont forget to point the toes with a slight leg lift to help with the rest of the core
GetMotivated,not_removed,theyre both juicing
GetMotivated,not_removed,dem wings
GetMotivated,not_removed,omg that girl is ripped
GetMotivated,not_removed,her mom has to be at least thats fucking amazing
GetMotivated,not_removed,you mom is bomb touches cap
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have no idea who this is
GetMotivated,not_removed,i uhh cant do one of these as a guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,uh moms cheating start again
GetMotivated,not_removed,i sold the premium leads to jerry graff
GetMotivated,not_removed,well that will do it unzips
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow she is in better shape than her tennis days
GetMotivated,not_removed,my ideal woman
GetMotivated,not_removed,as a man im legitimately jealous of her upper body strength and her abs
GetMotivated,not_removed,where did they get footage of me trying to do pull ups
GetMotivated,not_removed,its funny how people think pullups are done with the arms but really the muscles used are more in the shoulders and back once you do them right youll feel it
GetMotivated,not_removed,her mom looks so cute when she starts kicking her legs trying to get that one last rep
GetMotivated,not_removed,no idea who jesse graf is but i love her
GetMotivated,not_removed,kipping pull ups
GetMotivated,not_removed,she motivated me to pull as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats buff
GetMotivated,not_removed,jessie graffs father taught at the middle school i attended and jessie came in one time to tell everyone about her stunt woman job shes pretty awesome
GetMotivated,not_removed,in its own way that was sweet
GetMotivated,not_removed,still better technique than most crossfitters
GetMotivated,not_removed,she has a b cup thats not a typo its an inverted pair of tits
GetMotivated,not_removed,im pretty sure that women is stronger then me
GetMotivated,not_removed,she helped me get up
GetMotivated,not_removed,she was so sore the next day
GetMotivated,not_removed,i could sit here with my pants off and just watch this all day aaaaaaannd im done
GetMotivated,not_removed,why exactly does she need to be half naked im enjoying it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am aroused
GetMotivated,not_removed,love it
GetMotivated,not_removed,love it
GetMotivated,not_removed,she is different kinds of impressive
GetMotivated,not_removed,i feel like she is a virgin
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres no way jessie graff is natty i wonder what steroids she cycled
GetMotivated,not_removed,bad form shouldnt lock elbows
GetMotivated,not_removed,everybody seems to think jesse graff is the greatest thing ever from anw but compared to other female athletes even those from the same show shes really not that special
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is a great example on why women shouldnt lift gross
GetMotivated,not_removed,frogged mom
GetMotivated,not_removed,a potential survivor
GetMotivated,not_removed,especially if she had to swim her way out
GetMotivated,not_removed,im probably years younger cant do one
GetMotivated,not_removed,physical strength is useless in an emergency situation if you dont have mental strength edit why the down votes im just saying knowledge and attitude is more likely to save your life or someone elses life edit your muscles arent gonna save you when you are paralyzed by fear
GetMotivated,not_removed,she has the strength to save herself in a potential emergency situation what the hell does that mean like if shes in quicksand and theres a bar above her a woman whos able to pull a trigger has the strength to save herself in a potential emergency situation as well no
GetMotivated,not_removed,im more of a moms guy
GetMotivated,not_removed,graff for president
GetMotivated,not_removed,congatufuckinglations
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt she a supergirl stunt double
GetMotivated,not_removed,meh most of the super hero movies are stunt doubles kate beckinsale has less screen time then her stunt double team underworld rewatch civil war its all stunt doubles
GetMotivated,not_removed,typo there i think you meant wet dont mention it
GetMotivated,not_removed,most women cant do pullups no big deal
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know i cant even do one chinup
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you wont
GetMotivated,not_removed,those are known in the rbodyweightfitness community as doing negatives its a very real thing and one of the major steps to doing a new exercise when you cant to a full rep is to only do the easy half
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats called a negative many people recommend doing that for gaining strength for pullups
GetMotivated,not_removed,negatives for all of you who want to know the term to search
GetMotivated,not_removed,that seems likes a reasonable way to start you got to start somewhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,here is scoobie teaching that method
GetMotivated,not_removed,steffi graf stefffiii will yoo marry meee
GetMotivated,not_removed,before i saw your comment i wondered if agassi had aged as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah im a moron had to google it before i realized the and i honestly shouldve known better
GetMotivated,not_removed,rfitandnatural may be to your liking
GetMotivated,not_removed,because you like dudes
GetMotivated,not_removed,jessie graff she comes from the base of mt midoriyama and is training to be a ninja warrior
GetMotivated,not_removed,its impressive for a woman no doubt but its really just pathetic how many men she has beat when she doesnt even have the advantage of testosterone
GetMotivated,not_removed,rear delts and lats
GetMotivated,not_removed,please give us more updates on your masturbation
GetMotivated,not_removed,why does she have to be half clothed
GetMotivated,not_removed,i mean guys do the same topless plus just look at those abs good god
GetMotivated,not_removed,nah her daughter is right there in the video
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt the sexism on the part of the person who would criticize a women for that who cares what she wears
GetMotivated,not_removed,how is her choice to wear a skirt sexist
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a ninja skort apparently so theyre shorts that look like a skirt as long as theyre just as functional as shorts i dont see anything wrong with it
GetMotivated,not_removed,for future reference please list acceptable pull up attire you know do i can be taken srsly by beasts like u
GetMotivated,not_removed,and as soon as the thread is about attractiveness and your opinions thereof this wont be a slimeball thing to bring up
GetMotivated,not_removed,jessie is sad that your erotic needs have not been fulfilled
GetMotivated,not_removed,even from the same show you mean the show where she was the top performing woman and beat most of the men
GetMotivated,not_removed,im just wondering why you feel this way jessie was one of the only girls to make it through qualifying this year and one of the few girls who wasnt a wild card aka kacy pretty much every year shes the only girl to make it to stage and complete stage i also think meagan martin is pretty amazing she just needs to move through the obstacles quicker
GetMotivated,not_removed,she has a very specific set of skills
GetMotivated,not_removed,pls post selfie
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah goes against all logic but she could totally still die in an emergency situation even though she can do mad pullups
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i had to eat my way out id be fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,sounds like someone cant do a pullup
GetMotivated,not_removed,down votes because you used the word useless saying that couldnt ever factor in is being ignorant
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre getting downvoted because its absurd to think that physical strength is useless in any survival situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,not really you can be pounds too heavy with all the knowledge and attitude in the world youre still not gonna have the stamina to carry me down a flight of stairs
GetMotivated,not_removed,well then lets hope that she is smart and can keep her cool too
GetMotivated,not_removed,this implies that the two are mutually exclusive and that you cant muscle your way through a lot of emergencies ill give you a concrete and realworld example of why youre wrong i work in home health care and three of my clients are prone to falling when they take showers in order to develop coordination and selfsufficiency we help them grab onto a support bar in the bathroom then stand by themselves if and when they slip staff is there to catch them if you dont have a certain level of strength that person falls if you choose to think your way into setting clients on the more secure hoyer lift you lose the opportunity to give your clients physical stimulation and practice using their bodies life isnt like a dnd game where you have to roll for stats it is perfectly feasible to be in good physical shape without sacrificing your mental acuity
GetMotivated,not_removed,have you ever been in an emergency situation
GetMotivated,not_removed,someone felt threatened by healthy people
GetMotivated,not_removed,i see what youre trying to say but im still gonna down vote you because everyone else is
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre correct be as physically strong as you want but if you cave under pressure kiss your ass goodbye
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have never once seen a girl not screaming in a adverse situation nice try
GetMotivated,not_removed,if anything that should give you a bit of sympathy for her we dont choose our dads and she had to grow up and be raised by a real dick
GetMotivated,not_removed,he was grumpy from shooing random dudes out of the tree outside his house
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup
GetMotivated,not_removed,she already has me erect and i spell checked that one you guys
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant even get out of my chair
GetMotivated,not_removed,i believe in him
GetMotivated,not_removed,you were right but i will tomorrow xd
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe he changed
GetMotivated,not_removed,to add on theyre sometimes also referred to as eccentric pullups
GetMotivated,not_removed,also known as negatives in the rest of the weightliftingbodybuilding community
GetMotivated,not_removed,going through those submissions id say maybe of those are actually natty
GetMotivated,not_removed,rhardbodies is great too
GetMotivated,not_removed,you must be really unmuscular yourself to be so anti women being fit healthy is hot
GetMotivated,not_removed,this sounds more mystical than it really is
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,she doesnt have to be its her body and she chose to be
GetMotivated,not_removed,jesus graff
GetMotivated,not_removed,cuz broscience
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you do pullups in a skirt
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry for any of those that i may have offended i may have been judgemental about this woman and her lovely mother from my point of view ive personally never seen a single person wear a ninja skort and i feel they have little place within the gym i feel it seems as intentionally separative in a place where gender should be no boundry
GetMotivated,not_removed,should i pop the shirt
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yeah name one
GetMotivated,not_removed,we are trapped in here behind a wall of french fries me opening up a bottle of ketchup with a grin i have been training for this day all of my life
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol yes the old yeahbut im wily rationalization
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if you have to survive by playing mario kart against a mad man he lets you live until you lose how much is physical strength going to help in that situation huh huh
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is exactly what i meant thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,regardless of how physically gifted you are there is no running away from a bear in fact it is intellect that would save you if you came in contact with a bear i honestly think the guy is right that you have to be able to think in a life or death situation or you will die but i also dont know why he decided to bring that up
GetMotivated,not_removed,spent ftfy
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you wont
GetMotivated,not_removed,sponsorship tide raises all ships
GetMotivated,not_removed,i didnt know if it was called that elsewhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,well to be honest i would just work on progressing on barbell rows until you can do a good amount over your bodyweight pullups will be like cake after that when i was starting out i didnt find negatives that helpful
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh good it wasnt just me thinking nope
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not antiwomen being fit but when your abs stick out more than your boobs attraction is gone
GetMotivated,not_removed,well no but ive eaten a burrito with a fork im a rebel that way
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant speak for anyone else but i wasnt offended i actually had the same thought of well a skirt isnt the best clothing for working out in until i saw an ad about her new skirtshorts hybrid i dont see why her wanting to wear shorts that have a feminine take on them is an issue though if she feels comfortable and can perform in it i say go for it its not like shes setting a limit to her abilities by wearing it therefore no boundaries are created
GetMotivated,not_removed,if she encountered a horsesized duck
GetMotivated,not_removed,momentarily choked on the pad thai i was shoving into my face i literally could have died today goes back to shoving pad thai into face
GetMotivated,not_removed,also totally unrelated to the topic like you are ever gonna be accidentally hanging from the edge of the skyscraper and be like i dunno is my life even worth living pretty sure it is just a natural instinct to just try to save yourself in that case physical strength is all that matters we are not talking about a day walk through the jungle or something
GetMotivated,not_removed,rekt
GetMotivated,not_removed,shit you got me
GetMotivated,not_removed,ah okay that makes sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not convinced name another
GetMotivated,not_removed,do pull up onto horse sized duck and ride into battle like a fucking badass what else you got
GetMotivated,not_removed,its pretty funny you brought up pull up strengthbecause it hit a note with mei am ex military navyand i am pretty sure i survived one particular incident only because i had very good pull up capacity so i know precisely the point you were making
GetMotivated,not_removed,sometimes a person just comes along and has a better understanding of the real world than you do it can happen to anyone well anyone that isnt me in case that wasnt obvious
GetMotivated,not_removed,giant meteor
GetMotivated,not_removed,duck sized horses
GetMotivated,not_removed,tragic garden hose accident it got the spinal tap drummer
GetMotivated,not_removed,ill have you know etc
GetMotivated,not_removed,no problem shed just pull it up
GetMotivated,not_removed,horse sized dicks
GetMotivated,not_removed,ehnot so much simply having been in the service and having been in an accident of sorts is really nothing like threatening people with my special forces skills nice try though
GetMotivated,not_removed,whats the point of ice cream its just going to be gone after you eat it if youre a good game developer you will bring joy to others and your work may live on after you what more can you ask for
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had a lot of existential questions along those lines for a really long time where i thought nothing ever mattered because we will all die and even if i impact peoples lives they will also die someday so there is no point i was seeing a therapist at the time because i was curious to get to know myself better and felt a distance towards my friends the only piece of insight he gave me about that was thats its not about what will matter at the end of times its about the journey this didnt really resonate with me at the time i couldnt shake off the idea that the journey still wouldnt matter in the big scheme of things he had also diagnosed me a couple session earlier with depression and i almost laughed in his face me depressed nuhuh turns out he was right ive since addressed my depression and now i can say i rarely think about the end or the big picture im just enjoying the journey this doesnt mean ive found an answer to your question it just doesnt bother me as much my point is everyone has these thoughts about the end or their place in the universe and its absolutely normal i just hope they dont prevent you from living your life if so you need to address it
GetMotivated,not_removed,because it feels good
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you fulfill your dreams you will die in peace if you dont youll die remorseful or unsatisfied and you will die unhappy everything we do is for that one moment ultimately trust me its worth it its worth the peace in the end and the positive energy you hopefully leave behind for others
GetMotivated,not_removed,ever since i was a kid i wondered about this on a larger scale i felt that even the lives that i impacted would be futile in the grand scheme of things or anyone for that matter queue heat death of the universe but i also learned that there probably isnt an answer to this biologically we are programmed to survive but when we have everything we need are we just existing until the end yes and no would i be happier if every day id be unsure of getting a meal and my friends and family starving most certainly not but i wouldnt be wondering if my life was futile because every day i bring home food for my hungry family id see my purpose the difference is having some kind of goal or a purpose that perhaps now you dont have and that is not an issue in my opinion as we do have limited time we should strive to find things that make our life as happy as possible this doesnt mean easy for me this currently means getting a university degree that my lack of purpose stopped me from getting when i was younger for you it might be writing a novel or learning to play the banjo whatever it is take time to figure out where you want to be years from now and setup achievable goals to get there dont be afraid to put the bar high this will give you a sense of purpose and hopefully in the meantime you can be happy enjoying the smaller things in life
GetMotivated,not_removed,even though youve already seemed to get some great answers im going to throw my two cents in regardless to me life isnt about achieving its about showing to yourself that youve pushed past your boundaries of comfort and past the extents of what you thought was possible of you to exist is to be and to be is to do
GetMotivated,not_removed,well you are here now so why not make the most of it even if you dont make world changing contributions you can still have an impact on your self and others around you so make it positive it matters in that moment and even later remember what it feels like when others are nice to you yes nothing lasts forever but everything you do contributes to existence we are hear today thanks to the work that was done before us and is being done now if newton and einstein thought the same way civilization may not be where it is now i know these are big names but they were also toddlers and teenagers trying to figure things out at some point
GetMotivated,not_removed,so lets say you get dropped off at a museum for free one day are you gonna sit in the museums lobby until it closes because you wont be there forever or are you gonna dive balls deep into that museum until the lights go out life is the same way champ i was in that weird mental space too thinking of it this way made the most sense to me
GetMotivated,not_removed,for me is simple im know im going to die so ill do what ever i want i want to be happy i do whatever makes me happy enjoy yourself make your dreams true its corny but its true if you dont even try then why bother being alive give youre and when youre in your last minute in this world you will look back and say i fuckin did it go with a smile and your face
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you youve helped me the most
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,im reading zig ziglars life lifters its a good book with many short chapters its something that could be read for only a few minutes each morning
GetMotivated,not_removed,only a fool would trust little finger
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really dont know if petyr baelish is the man to be taking life advice from
GetMotivated,not_removed,great minds think alike ive been thinking along the exact same lines and it was before that episode but my mind picture unlike his is not a specific goal in life but rather a person i want to be act the way which brings me closer to the image of the person i would like to be although i still have to pull my act together to follow my own advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the way to be creepily obsessed af so sexy
GetMotivated,not_removed,the best quote from him chaos is a laddarhhh
GetMotivated,not_removed,get motivated to marry your one true loves daughter
GetMotivated,not_removed,motivation from the devil himself
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would do anything to get what i want
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a pretty picture
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats a big quote
GetMotivated,not_removed,please dont reduce the show to these crappy motivational pictures
GetMotivated,not_removed,why highly succesfull selfmade probably rich af has an army exactly the person you want to take advice from goodietwoshoes dont get far in this world
GetMotivated,not_removed,he always gives pretty sound advice everybody dies sooner or later and dont worry about your death worry about your life take charge of your life for as long as it lasts a lot can happen between now and never only by admitting what we are can we get what we want the climb is all there is
GetMotivated,not_removed,this quote is really good otherwise i agree fuck petyr
GetMotivated,not_removed,because it isnt worth it to destroy the lives of others just to profit yourself and hes fucked over everyone close to him
GetMotivated,not_removed,im almost certain the writers saw that his dialogue with varys regarding the climb went viral and from there on out has been given some pretty quotable lines regarding his character hes the most interesting character in the show
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is wonderful thank you for sharing
GetMotivated,not_removed,very touching
GetMotivated,not_removed,thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,👌🏼👌🏼
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont have info on testing but i know meditation helps me realize priorities list making is good for accomplishing objectives compartmentalization of a major task into doable parts helps a lot setting a timer for unpleasant tasks is very helpful in preventing procrastination examples below big task get the car ready for winter first list all that needs done then prioritize it then concentrate on one priority at a time without worrying about the whole task unpleasant task clean bathroom set time to or whatever number of minutes you want and say i will spend x minutes per day at this task until it is done
GetMotivated,not_removed,kind of a silly thing to compare both have their place and you could certainly do both but most of the time when people make lists to cure their procrastination they dont follow through mindfulness meditation will give you a tool to actually think about your priorities and come to terms with what you need and want to do in a truly profound way imagine feeling peace and determination simultaneously also the thing about meditation is your supposed to do it often if not daily it gives you a chance to frequently refresh your mind and get into a healthy head space to take on your day

GetMotivated,not_removed,this morning my amazing wife pointed out that i hadnt marked my days sober like i used too since i stopped drinking last april i had been marking each day off to remind myself that im getting better and stronger the last couple of weeks i havent been marking the days not because i fell off the wagon but because i havent spent a lot of time thinking about being sober its freeing knowing that alcohol no longer controls my life since giving up alcohol life has gotten so much better not that it wasnt great before but normally i was too drunk at night to realize we bought a house that we have fallen in love with work has become so much easier and im producing higher quality work something i would never have had the time to do due to drinking is to create my passion project a cooking show which im really proud of and its now starting to find its legs another bonus is ive lost my wife has been beyond amazing to the point of not drinking to support me too i also shaved off my shitty neck beard to help remind myself how much things have changed my beard was a sign of laziness and how much i had lost focus on things if you feel like youre stuck in the trap of drinking too much just focus on not drinking one day at a time i constantly remind myself whenever im tempted that if i dont drink i wont feel like shit tomorrow today is days since my last drink thank you all of your ongoing support

GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing this here
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,it would be nice if my attention span lasted more that minutes so i could watch this and get motivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,all of your things you enjoy are the opposite of what i think is good they seem like failures to me not having a set thing to do besides art your friends that are doctors and engineers are bettering the world youre creating art good for you but that should be a side job or a hobby your first two paragraphs sound like something a hippy would say jerking off and eating pizza eveyday sounds awful wouldnt you rather have sex with whatever gender you like wouldnt you rather travel and eat that pizza from somewhere else besides your moms basement
GetMotivated,not_removed,im prescribed adderall they do have their side effects im a skateboarder and i sweat so easily its hard when im listening to music to it gets my hyped and id be going like mph on a straight road it helps me in social situations to but i wouldnt eat or sleep
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep like dog walkers its something anyone can do unless you get into a larger company like a marketing firm art only holds value when two parties fight over a price otherwise its just doodles
GetMotivated,not_removed,i understand why you are here then
GetMotivated,not_removed,because its a positive subreddit with a positive message or are you referring to some insult that would be the same for you

GetMotivated,not_removed,too lazy to grab a sheet of college rule
GetMotivated,not_removed,i read this in little fingers voice
GetMotivated,not_removed,if your body mind and spirit take a step back youre a fucking rock you cant shine without hard work and sometimes hard work requires sleepless nights its nice and all to believe in this crap and if that makes you happy good for you but if you want to be successful youre going to have to work and work requires effort effort that cannot be maintained if your body mind and spirit are taking a step back
GetMotivated,not_removed,i blame the internet damn beautiful but dangerous tool
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont see very many people looking up to others who runs on fumes i only see people look up to others when they the people are running on fumes and the others they look up to are perfectly fine while doing the exact same thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,because pushing yourself beyond your limits is the only way to find you have none
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,why do we hold pedestals for the sleepless nights break downs and inner turmoil because it isnt easy we prize mental fortitude it motivates others when they see someone full of so much passion they are able to push through sleeplessness break downs and inner turmoil
GetMotivated,not_removed,i respectfully disagree or maybe were getting two different interpretations out of this im at a university right now where the cool thing to do is to study all night and to not sleep not that i disagree that hard work and sacrifice is necessary for success but i also strongly believe that taking care of your body and mind is just as important for me i always need to ask myself what good is success if im not happy and there is no way i can be happy personally if im running on less than hours of sleep and not working out daily i strongly believe that if you have time management skills you can turn any day into a productive and successful one while not losing consistent sleep and staying healthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really like this post because it questions our paradigm something that should be done more often but i agree with you that the wording is not perfect yet its more like why are you letting yourself be pushed to the point where youre running on fumes thats the real question
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you have never found your limit you found what you had thought your limit was of course people have limits are you fucking stupid
GetMotivated,not_removed,and there is no way i can be happy personally if im running on less than hours of sleep and not working out daily thats just your opinion though isnt it like if thats what makes you happy personally then great yet i dont care how many hours of sleep im sleeping as long as im achieving my goals which makes me happy and thats somehow wrong
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree with the paradigm bit thats mainly why i replied as i did youre retort to mine is just another step in that same chain you cant just ask yourself questions like that you have to at least attempt to answer them
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you fucking sorry i once held my breath and havent taken one since hows that for no limits bitch
GetMotivated,not_removed,agreed i think we are talking about the same thing just from two different perspectives
GetMotivated,not_removed,true but what is the answer
GetMotivated,not_removed,internet tough guy bullshit kek
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats on you bro just keep following the chain until youre satisfied or until you figure out what will make you satisfied
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would do the what the fuck did you say to me copy pasta right now but im lazy and on mobile just imagine i did please
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats awesome you have quite a supportive grandfather
GetMotivated,not_removed,never quit except whatever it was you went to rehab for quit doing what you did and never be a quitter and whatever you do dont quit quitting
GetMotivated,not_removed,how long have you been sober op
GetMotivated,not_removed,when i got out i found all my things packed and a note telling me i was no longer welcomed
GetMotivated,not_removed,shia is not that old i think
GetMotivated,not_removed,never quit smoking
GetMotivated,not_removed,nice repost man
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats so beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,at least he should correct todays
GetMotivated,not_removed,looks like someone is trying to get some sweet sweet karma
GetMotivated,not_removed,boooooo downvotes
GetMotivated,not_removed,im sorry to hear that bro i got disowned by my family when i was still in college and faced a lot of adversity too and thats okay cos new friends and relationships can keep coming in life nothing and nobody can stop that as long as youre open to it
GetMotivated,not_removed,what happened no longer yesterday no matters
GetMotivated,not_removed,i still dont understand why anyone watches his videos
GetMotivated,not_removed,explain
GetMotivated,not_removed,casey why dont you take off your glasses so i can see the camera you can lie to me but you cant lie to yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i still dont get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,nothing to get i was just pointing out that a lot of people are just haters if you dont wanna watch his videos dont do it you dont have to go around spewing hate on him because you think you are better or something get off your high horse and go live your life and stop commenting on a fucking youtube channel if thats an achievement im glad my life isnt that fucking sad tldr my comment was sarcastic uimperatorize is just a hater with a sad life
GetMotivated,not_removed,right sorry
GetMotivated,not_removed,lmao are you actually laughing at how triggered you got about my comment hahaha
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha indeed
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have to learn to love the process and not worry about the end goal that varies depending on what you do for example as a writer you have to learn to love the physical act of sitting thinking and writing without worrying about what you will do with the finished product you could burn it and still be happy having enjoyed the process what is it that you do
GetMotivated,not_removed,what are you trying to achieve is getting closer to your dream beneficial example i want to be very muscular along the way i enjoy being slightly more improved than i was last time
GetMotivated,not_removed,it took me failing over and over and being so burnt out that i had no choice but to do whatever it takes to love the process because the end result was no longer motivating for me it is now secondary and the wait wait dont quit when i feel tired
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for sharing first question is the tech that you are developing are you doing it because you think it is awesome and will change the world do you truly believe in its value are you doing it because it is just your job are you doing it in hopes that you will become a multi millionaire what exactly is your end goal is it to continue making kick ass products that people will love for your entire life or would you rather just get the big payday and be able to relax i ask because it is important for you to understand why you are doing this at all it sounds like there are parts of this that you love but you sometimes get disheartened by the tedious nature of the job knowing the why of it all will help keep your mind on the right track to enjoy the process you will have to just become more aware of what you are actually doing on a daily basis of your job you may not know it but you are proble solving and trouble shooting constantly its just so normal to you you cant see it a good way to notice this is to start keeping a short journal where you talk about the things you did that day by verbalizing it you will begin to see the progression you are making each day try the app dayone its simple and well designed another thing you can do to start enjoying the process is to constantly push yourself how can you get better at your job how can you learn to do what should take you two weeks in two days begin keeping metrics on your work and see how can you improve what would be your dream version of the job like working for google or something what would you have to be able to do for them to beg you to work for them learn how to do that start taking pride in the fact that you have stuck with something long enough something that very few people know how to do for someone to hire you and trust you enough with work for them just keep improving increase your typing sit up straighter do everything you can to make each second as enjoyable as possible set small hourly goals and blast through them i hope this helps please respond with any thoughts
GetMotivated,not_removed,feel free to message me with a little more detail about what you want to do i might be able to offer some helpful advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,needs more jpeg
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah im not sure why it looks like that is there a way i can edit the post and reload the picture

GetMotivated,not_removed,the good lord made us all out of iron then he turns up the heat to forge some of us into steel
GetMotivated,not_removed,yea not a fan of the guy but its true
GetMotivated,not_removed,but thats wrong the best stainless steels are cast at where cheap carbon steel can be cast up to
GetMotivated,not_removed,ouch thats fucking hot
GetMotivated,not_removed,we are going into some pretty complex stuff here does science even have a concept for fires that are the most hot possible
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is not the point but good job living up to your name

GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,are you changing your current regime for aesthetic or for performance
GetMotivated,not_removed,the sad fact is that youll have to make cuts to one or the other eventually homeostasis recovery and sleep are extremely important and often overlooked its not so much an issue when you can rest your legs while working something else the next day but as you said the climbing is all over and intense
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would say its about a split if i just wanted only aesthetics i would probably just do squats without the program
GetMotivated,not_removed,boo i was afraid of that
GetMotivated,not_removed,im really not an expert on rock climbing but i assume that its mainly focused around upper and some lower body muscular endurance if you want to become a better rock climber theres going to be a specific body type thats best for sport additionally there are going to be exercises that have the most transferability ie weighted wide grip chin ups i also imagine that most rock climbers have amazing strength to body mass ratios so any additional mass put on for the sake of aesthetic will likely hinder performance overtraining is also real the body needs rest in order to repair different tissues and adapt with that being said you can train twice a day skill session rock climbing and one gym session if you give yourself adequate nutrition and rest time in between you really want to establish what your goals are though and then plan from there if its something will probably suffer in the process
GetMotivated,not_removed,eventually but dont be afraid of starting get in the rhythm of lifting and when you stall out switch to a monthly progressive program but just get started
GetMotivated,not_removed,definitely the more lean i could be the better id be at rock climbing i hadnt thought of the two conflicting thanks for the info about training twice a day i may try to make that work appreciate all the advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,im a complete newbie to lifting what do you mean by monthly progressive program thanks for the info
GetMotivated,not_removed,stronglifts progresses every workout meaning if you successfully complete the workout you add more weight next workout after a while youll stall and wont hit every workout you can deload and try again switch to or or switch up to a weekly or monthly progressive program meaning weights get bumped every week or month after a while youll probably want to prioritize lifting or climbing onceyou find that youre not recovering well enough in the meantime workout climb eat well get good sleep and have a rocking time
GetMotivated,not_removed,credit to utastyfishbits for the original post i found this inspiring and got chills when i read it this man knows what he wants to do and has a plan on how to get there the part about having two friends to text per class gave me chills made me realize how much ive relied on others to get through college ive been so blessed and hope this guy is too
GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome im currently reading smarter faster better
GetMotivated,not_removed,this guy also wrote a book called the power of habit its awesome its funny i think you can have leaned this skill but it may not always fill your life im transgender it took years and years to find that inner drive that i am even allowed to act on the world that i have free will and today i am quite self motivated i work in personal projects follow through on all the important stuff i even came up with a plan to buy a big van convert it to an rv then travel the country avoiding the cold because of my chronic pain condition through all the pain and bullshit and depression i followed through my first trip in the van was the weeks ago im about to go on a month long trip and then i should be gone for good me the anxious scared tiny disabled passive lunar limbo has built a new home in months but i still cannot buy clothing i still cant use this subversive inner sense of power control fucking so hard sigh keep going i suppose

GetMotivated,not_removed,eisenhower matrix for prioritizing pareto principle which adheres to the next one good enough is usually actually good enough especially for us perfectionist this is a big one my new goal is to do almost everything as effortless as i can that way i ensure to get things actually done only when i am done with my task eg cleaning my closet writing a paper i allow myself to go back review and make improvements usually i come to the conclusion it is good enough and that i have other shit to do time to move on

GetMotivated,not_removed,read this wonderful article to increase your knowhow
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,i cant believe that even with the wit of nietzsche
GetMotivated,not_removed,what a great article to start my day with thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,repetition repetition an object in motion tends to stay in motion im like that too the more i do the more i want to keep doing
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe add arithmetic as a personal project projects minutes minutes minutes hour minutes nonetheless good idea when ive tried similar plans i couldnt get passed weeks on a schedule like this with minute blocks maybe i should try again with short chunks
GetMotivated,not_removed,this shit is life changing thank you very much
GetMotivated,not_removed,this isnt a bad idea i go to school and work and have children i wish so much i wasnt as lazy as i am like i have an alarm set for to run and i havent done it in monthsbut sometimes i do get off work at or just to wake up at and get kiddos ready for school ill try the min approach to solidify a routine now if its a solid routine then it should stick
GetMotivated,not_removed,great motivation
GetMotivated,not_removed,this motivated me and ive now made a list thank things to do daily clean work out and run write sing listen to music play a game read motivational inspirational things study geography meditate stretch ive done and today
GetMotivated,not_removed,ill make mine going on reddit going on ifunny playing gta and making pizza
GetMotivated,not_removed,yep he must add arithmetic lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,im lucky that i dont have to work and my three kids are all in their early and out of the house when i was in your shoes the most i could do was spend ten minutes per day on one project but doing just that i was amazed at how much i could get done by committing just ten minutes a day to it
GetMotivated,not_removed,oops thanks for catching my mistake i will add minutes of arithmetic practice to my daily schedule of projects

GetMotivated,not_removed,awesome i missed this one from school of life
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive got dead flowers in my bedroom to remind me of death i placed them there at the age of ﻿
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really enjoy it myself lots of good advice in general
GetMotivated,not_removed,eat three meals a day
GetMotivated,not_removed,but thats just regular training
GetMotivated,not_removed,dont forget to turn off the ac
GetMotivated,not_removed,and never use your ac to strengthen your mind
GetMotivated,not_removed,tried it and broke my body
GetMotivated,not_removed,that would make you quite healthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,author was brilliant how to motivate the youth into exercising put it in a hotblooded shonen make it easy to remember make it easy to shout make a good manga and anime so that people get excited about it its not so much the specific exercises thats important its the every day part that makes this valuable do something and stick to it even if its simple
GetMotivated,not_removed,as he says himself you have to have just a banana for breakfast and not use your ac
GetMotivated,not_removed,that would kill my knees lol i would be a crip after a month
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly this is not a huge effort the might be rough initially but totally trainable in a few months the situps just do crunches or something the rest is honestly what everyone should do every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about pull ups need to balance out all the push ups
GetMotivated,not_removed,is that all try training for an ironman
GetMotivated,not_removed,sit ups are pretty bad for your back do planks
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i certainly applaud anyone wanting to do a hundred pushups but take it from this old gym rat ive spent my entire adult life in the gym and a program like this one can do more harm than good if you only train one part of your body and thats all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you youre setting yourself up for injuries down the road ive seen it a hundred times its like putting a powerful engine in a stock toyota tercel what will you accomplish youll blow out the drive train the clutch the transmission etc because those factory parts arent designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine pushups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent the triceps what you really want to do is train your entire body all the major muscle groups chest back abdomen legs shoulders and arms at the same time over the course of a workout and dont forget your cardiovascular work im proud of you guys wanting to do this three cheers falling in love with exercise eating right etc is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself and you will fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress youll make but do it right okay my advice find a good gym with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you especially in the beginning until you get the hang of it yourself and guide you in your quest for physical fitness thirty to minutes a day three days a week is all youll ever need to do i refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that especially considering how important it is and dont worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym you have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time so no one will say anything to you and very very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway now get out there and do it credit
GetMotivated,not_removed,people are saying this is a bad workout is there any actual good advice that can be broken down into a similar little blurb to this
GetMotivated,not_removed,i quite like having my hair thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,you know this might not be too motivational but just an attempt to correct this image slightly you dont want to exercise every single day as your body needs recovery time too for the workout to be truly effective rest is really important too otherwise your body is just constantly pressured and the training stops being effective
GetMotivated,not_removed,do this routine if you want muscle imbalances
GetMotivated,not_removed,having seen opm i think the creator was hinting at a more metaphorical meaning because saitama repeatedly desires to be a superhero doing mundane simple things persistently with a higher ambition is what leads to true strength rather than trying to find the direct route to greatness saitama is powerful because he is humble and his ego doesnt stop him from continuing his simple routine
GetMotivated,not_removed,every day it gets a little easier but you gotta do it every day thats the hard part someone from bojack horseman
GetMotivated,not_removed,love this show
GetMotivated,not_removed,a banana will suffice until your knees explode
GetMotivated,not_removed,not gonna lie this show helped me regain my motivation to lose weight i had managed to lose almost but before opm stayed to creep back upwards now im up to push ups sit ups and usually bike to might not become the worlds strongest but at least its a start
GetMotivated,not_removed,i also supported this idea until i saw running
GetMotivated,not_removed,replace the running with pull ups and youve got a crossfit workout
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is actually over training you could do this twice a week and become brod the fuck out and jacked
GetMotivated,not_removed,who is this
GetMotivated,not_removed,well i mean thats not too terrible
GetMotivated,not_removed,now thats a motivational thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,im not too sure if that is healthy a brother gotta rest and recover
GetMotivated,not_removed,no i will not play rock paper scissors with you youve got a booger on your finger
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am just confused as to what sit ups is gonna work that isnt covered by push ups and squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,would that be over the course of a day or all at once i can probably do that now if i break it up over several mini sessions
GetMotivated,not_removed,well got to say this aint so much but who has the time of an hour for that training got to quit reddit then
GetMotivated,not_removed,the easiest way to do this is a method called where you do one push up followed by one v upor crunchfollowed by one squat jump than two push ups two v ups two squat jumps etc up to ten than back down to one ends up being of each
GetMotivated,not_removed,phht noobs
GetMotivated,not_removed,is this a good workout and is it healthy
GetMotivated,not_removed,no caffeine before sleep
GetMotivated,not_removed,pretty inefficient barbell training is where its at broseph
GetMotivated,not_removed,and crack mixed with lsd lots of it
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats not that muchor that hardit you divide into exercises per day its actually easy if you cant do pushups on the spot right now then well get motivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,has anyone actually done this though
GetMotivated,not_removed,this isnt a good work out plan at all just in case anyone doesnt know yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not that hard
GetMotivated,not_removed,people say this is noway he could become that strong with doing something as simple as that but its still a lot more than i can do xd
GetMotivated,not_removed,you know though this is actually a horrible fitness regime
GetMotivated,not_removed,my friend brought up that he expects a different explanation for saitamas power i told him the current one was perfect
GetMotivated,not_removed,i believe you meant to post this in rgetdiscouragedandgobacktoplayingvideogames
GetMotivated,not_removed,god i love this show i want more
GetMotivated,not_removed,you all talk about regular training but i dont see any lurkers here doing it
GetMotivated,not_removed,obligatory psa if your body is currently optimized for manga reading then sit ups can be very detrimental to your back opt for planks instead
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok
GetMotivated,not_removed,train so hard your hair falls out
GetMotivated,not_removed,overtraining
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a terrible terrible idea theres a reason sportsmen exercise every muscle group and do not put of effort into legs and spread the rest between all the other muscle groups
GetMotivated,not_removed,more like how to pass out faster and burst your heart 😂😂 unless you are some arnold mf
GetMotivated,not_removed,seriously guys everything except the run should be a pretty obtainable goal to reach yall some weak people
GetMotivated,not_removed,i hope you like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,about miles a week not bad most i ever got to was miles per week youd need quite a bit of training and not carry any excess weight to take care of your joints enough to do this
GetMotivated,not_removed,turns out he does all of these with a backpack full of lead
GetMotivated,not_removed,had this up on my wall for the longest time felt so guilty i couldnt do it i tore it down
GetMotivated,not_removed,is this the worst sub in all of reddit its a real possibility
GetMotivated,not_removed,its miles
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd end up neglecting your biceps and other pulling muscles though throw some pull ups in and were set
GetMotivated,not_removed,no pullups are you fucking stupid
GetMotivated,not_removed,i have a theory he is a monster a lot of whatvwe saw were people who went to extreme lengths and became monsters of that form he trained so hard relative to his normal body that he became a monster of strength
GetMotivated,not_removed,no air conditioning
GetMotivated,not_removed,y no
GetMotivated,not_removed,how to become a prefecture that is like second rate chiba nah
GetMotivated,not_removed,unfortunately my teacher ran miles every day for years and had the most fcked up knees so dont do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,im happy to say that ive done push ups and squats in three days im feeling a definite change i will use the weekends to rest though unfortunately i havent done crunches yet due to stomach cramps instead of running i decided to make sure i walk more than steps each day thanks to my fitbit havent faltered yet
GetMotivated,not_removed,is a far ass run
GetMotivated,not_removed,i see saitama and i think of the prefecture where i go paragliding on the weekends in japan no need for that many situps etc lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,is that krillin
GetMotivated,not_removed,why the fuck has this been upvoted and why is this in getmotivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,decrease that amount by about and we good 👌🏼😂👌🏼😂
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh yea nothing motivates me more than to see a cartoon character say the stupidest shit
GetMotivated,not_removed,will blow out a knee running a day
GetMotivated,not_removed,ouch thats going to fuck up your joints
GetMotivated,not_removed,the lack of motivation in this thread is ridiculous you absolutely have time for this everyday anything you say otherwise is just an excuse as to why you havent succeeded yet pm me for time management tips
GetMotivated,not_removed,you should not start out doing this this is how you destroy your shoulders and knees by the time youre i used to do push ups a day and my shoulders were seriously strained from that even do a more balanced workout and spare your joints
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you get your motivation from comic books or anime you are already screwed to begin with
GetMotivated,not_removed,to anyone who might be taking this seriously dont do this check out rbodyweightfitness if you want to use your body to get stronger and healthier
GetMotivated,not_removed,goku wins he does push ups while wearing weighted clothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,the push ups sit up and squats are a waste of time edit they are you arent going to gain any muscle from this you arent going to maintain any muscle this wont do anything substantial or at all for your posture you wont get any sort of endorphin release or enough to notice and the calories you burn will be negligible you mine as well just run for another minutes
GetMotivated,not_removed,just a banana in the morning is okay
GetMotivated,not_removed,proper portioned meals insert the video where the guy who ate a few peas and corn all week and went nuts on sunday
GetMotivated,not_removed,my theory is that it was actually really difficult for him but he dedicated himself completely and inadvertently reached enlightenment and is now an avatar of god
GetMotivated,not_removed,regular training done everyday with no breaks no matter how sore or broken your body is
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the joke this manga is a comedy you know
GetMotivated,not_removed,not regular thats pretty lowball actually and will not get you anywhere in terms of strength let alone god tier
GetMotivated,not_removed,strength training
GetMotivated,not_removed,being poor is making me very strong apparently
GetMotivated,not_removed,try reps of pushupssitups its horrible when you start but it gets much easier after a few days
GetMotivated,not_removed,there is a chance of going bald though
GetMotivated,not_removed,a day every day youll probably have knee issues in a very short while training regimens usually have rest days and varied programme to hit different muscle groups
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly jogging every day would be excessive joint strain long term switch your cardio to include off trail hiking rowing and biking also make sure to vary your bodyweight exercises that would end up with some serious imbalances the work ethic though is on point
GetMotivated,not_removed,the original webcomic was made by a guy named one and looked like doodles the shounen for it was then redrawn by a professional manga artist yusuke murata yusuke murata illustrated eyeshield to put things into perspective then years down the line my favorite studio based madhouse picks up yusuke muratas redrawing and turns it into the anime doing the manga every bit of justice theres the facts really just wanted to make the correlation that the manga looked way more amateurish before it was redrawn it did have a huge cult following though with one and its the popularity that warranted the redrawing from yusuke murata
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone that doesnt normally train at all i tried this for two days after that i had sore muscles for over a week lol couldnt even walk nor could i sit downget up on the couchtoilet without support the gandalf stick i found in my basement finally got some use as a crutch
GetMotivated,not_removed,no ne said well balanced meals but a banana in the morning is fine too meaning waking up eating the banana to you day if yoi dont feel like making something you would make up the rest of breakfast your other meals he saying eat a banana even if you dont like eating first thing like alot of paople
GetMotivated,not_removed,gangs arent the answer
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats actually the running joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,good video on someone who tries it out
GetMotivated,not_removed,pushups in a row may be nasty too
GetMotivated,not_removed,well tbh its pretty weird to do reps instead of less reps with more difficulty unless you just want to be good at basic pushups squats and situps
GetMotivated,not_removed,its time constraints too though everyday after work hell if we say we get home from work at go sleep at for a wake up then we have about hours in between from work to sleep take up near hours just stretching running recovering and youre tired at the end of it hours left in the day and theres really not much time left every single day is possibleif you are unemployed dont have a girlfriend or friends and have someone to do your chores for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you stop well know well know
GetMotivated,not_removed,i did five pushups once
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah this has already kinda been said but ill just reiterate this show is called one punch man and its an actioncomedy that parodies popular anime depicting characters with unreal strength like dragon ball z he claims to have gotten beyond godlike power from doing these things but in reality the viewers and maybe even the main character himself saitama have no clue how he got what appears to be infinite unstoppable power unlike other shows hes actually capable defeating any enemy or anyone in general with a single punch it sounds ridiculous because it is but thats because with all of its success it has become unique
GetMotivated,not_removed,excuse me you do fucking squats a day
GetMotivated,not_removed,shouldnt you have days of rest or you wont become stronger
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd be surprised at the number of people who cant support their own weight
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha on the fitness team at my school saitamas workout is almost our warmup😂😂 ironmans are something else though
GetMotivated,not_removed,hanging leg raises are better for muscle activation
GetMotivated,not_removed,plank is a static exercise that has little to no synergy between the strength you increase to actual dynamic movements you can do all the planking you like it wont really bring much result other than becoming better at doing the plank theres a wide selection of dynamic exercises that will be significantly more worth your time than doing the plank thats both in terms of increasing muscle mass and strength google dynamic vs static exercises and look for yourself if this is new information to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,heavy compound lifts for core strength my abs get worked more when i squat than when i do decline situps
GetMotivated,not_removed,no one is going to overdevelop a part of your body doing pushups and squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,i thought you also trained some shoulder back and abdominal groups as well with pushups
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive been going to the gym times a week for almost years i can see the results but they are very small ive also dropped the soda and pizzahamburger any tips
GetMotivated,not_removed,you could try this httpswwwredditcomrbodyweightfitnesswikikbrecommendedroutine the page might seem intimidating but it boils down to pullups dips lsit squats pushups rows
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres this amazing thing called google that can help you find a good beginner without regime
GetMotivated,not_removed,if youre having trouble motivating yourself to search for the answers yourself well then im not sure youre going to get far with the workout
GetMotivated,not_removed,its supposed to be a joke saitamas workout makes no sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre not going to cause any noticeable amount of muscle imbalances doing pushups and squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,but then what about mumen rider mans got a heart of gold and balls of steel
GetMotivated,not_removed,saitama from one punch man
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah in the afternoons p
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive done the pushups and squats so far
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a running joke and everyone in the series comments on how the training program makes no sense even for a normal person so yeah dont actually do this would be pretty terrible you can take inspiration from the every day part i guess
GetMotivated,not_removed,has actually shown that its a myth that running causes bad knees even for marathon runners running is incredibly healthy for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes this is the comment i was looking for this program is a big pile of shit people really shouldnt go for it
GetMotivated,not_removed,just sacrifice one hour everyday for running arent that far
GetMotivated,not_removed,its not to be taken seriously its an anime reference but the context of the wording in the show is the motivation itself you had to have watched it to get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,every day is fine as long as youre in shape for it i run days a week minimum and have never had any knee issues
GetMotivated,not_removed,if you dont get the reference you wont get motivated
GetMotivated,not_removed,only a weak fool would talk such crap of course press ups and squats improve your strength and body what kind of nonsense are you chatting any excuse to sit on your arse and eat potato chips eh
GetMotivated,not_removed,master youare so full of crap
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats what she said
GetMotivated,not_removed,theres no such thing as just a banana
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,in that world people who focus or are downright obsessed became the embodiment of that dedication a man who ate too much crab became a crab monster a man loving cars became a car monster saitama dedicated everything to be the strongest hero and sure enough he became the strongest hero
GetMotivated,not_removed,enlightenment to buddha is something supported by some of the symbolism of the show it doesnt matter that that was his workout plan what matters was his completely undiluted will to walk down that path
GetMotivated,not_removed,imho there is no backstory to his powers like people think there is no dedication symbolism or religious fascinations etc when he saved that kid in the park and said i guess i will try being a hero you can see his eyes change it is this silly plot that makes this show great
GetMotivated,not_removed,remains pretty simple except the running running is pain in the ass
GetMotivated,not_removed,still very easy to do its just a joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,that was a reference to opm since thats the reply everyone around says to him although he believes that the training he did was responsible for his powers no one else believes him they all just say thats just regular training
GetMotivated,not_removed,he was quoting the response from the manga when saitma reveals this
GetMotivated,not_removed,exact quote from cyborg
GetMotivated,not_removed,woosh
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats the point he did something so generic and uninspiring no one thought it would work
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah strong smellin gotemjpg
GetMotivated,not_removed,arent situps bad for you because they mess up your spine you can get the same to better results by doing planks
GetMotivated,not_removed,he was making a joke
GetMotivated,not_removed,im out
GetMotivated,not_removed,can confirm i workout days a week am going bald
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am almost bald i asked if i still need to follow same regime to be saitama rronepunchman apparently i am becoming stronger naturally
GetMotivated,not_removed,question isi can become like jason statham cant i
GetMotivated,not_removed,for people with healthy knees running more will tend to reinforce that healthiness for people with knee problems running more will tend to reinforce those problems
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is so easy to over do i used to run between every other day and now i cant even do a squat because of the stress on both my knees hoping that it gets better because i miss that feeling of running
GetMotivated,not_removed,doing it the past months only blown lbs off me
GetMotivated,not_removed,i know quite a few people who rack up miles a week as long as you stay on top of your recovery and build up to it sensibly a day isnt going to destroy you press ups and sit ups a day without any stretching or working the opposing muscles would be more problematic imo
GetMotivated,not_removed,ive run everyday for the past years doctor says as long as i dont over extend knees will be fine
GetMotivated,not_removed,other than the running none of these are really that extreme and for the the running i know a marathon runner who used to do something like that every day she ran for an hour every morning except sundays on her treadmill looking it up the average for women is a little over an hour
GetMotivated,not_removed,isnt that far like an hour of running
GetMotivated,not_removed,i like how he made saitama look and how he said that even stank ass lookin characters can be heroes
GetMotivated,not_removed,you did push ups and ran with no training at all
GetMotivated,not_removed,keep doing it dont worry if you start going bald be a hero for fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,as someone that doesnt normally train at all you gotta ease into it buddy lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you proofread before you click submit or is your keyboard just broken
GetMotivated,not_removed,this is beautiful
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldw
GetMotivated,not_removed,the world record for the abdominal plank is hours and minute our bodies are insane when you condition them right
GetMotivated,not_removed,its just endurance the difficult part is training to break the barrier or so after that it becomes basically cardio
GetMotivated,not_removed,why will it make u poop
GetMotivated,not_removed,no its not
GetMotivated,not_removed,this sounds weird but its actually pretty doable with a lot of practice im on my schools fitness team and before we go to nationals we do like pushups a day broken up then come the competitions it feels easy
GetMotivated,not_removed,im just thinking from an average loser perspective i dont care if its spaced out as sets of or two sets of if youre doing pushups squats and youre gunna get in shape
GetMotivated,not_removed,are we talking squats with a bar and weights or air squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,every day is possible if you won the kneecaps genetic lottery otherwise time constraints or not you will fail badly
GetMotivated,not_removed,i am in offseason marathon training right now which means i run runs times a week and do stadium runs andor wind sprints on my off days its just changing stimuli i wake up at every morning so my wife can shower and get ready have a full time job and travel for work its just about making a schedule and not compromising on it the only downside is right now its fudging cold its currently degrees in lovely st louis missouri and i am freezing my ass off source my cold ass is walking to the high school track right now
GetMotivated,not_removed,depends on how long you take for a run if id have to do the saitama training id actually have more freetime than i currently have because his training would take under an hour and i spend in the gym each day
GetMotivated,not_removed,every single day is possibleif you are unemployed dont have a girlfriend or friends and have someone to do your chores for you i do everyday weekdays intense training and got a full time to desk job twin kids olds and do all the basic chores dishes take the garbage out play with my kids walk the dog some husbandwife time and gaming for like every weekday yes i cook a week too im dead but hell i feel fine never felt better
GetMotivated,not_removed,you have to make time in your life i work fulltime have an so do full meal prep household chores and manage to lift weights for hrs or so a week i assume you dont work weekends theres two opportunities right there just make time during the week
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,fair bodyweight rows then
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think he means hes training to be able to lift an iron man action figure they can be heavy sometimes
GetMotivated,not_removed,i gained much more core strength with planks than absurd situp reps
GetMotivated,not_removed,to the person downvoting without replying do you disagree if youd like to see my specific sources for this statement i can provide that given theres an interest that i do so the plank is not as great or useful as many seems to believe
GetMotivated,not_removed,you are completely right that the plank is a static exercise and does little to improve your dynamic strength however the other direction is also true so probably to a lesser degree dynamic exercises like hanging leg raises have less of an effect for your static strength in everyday life i argue that static strength for your core is usually more important think about lifting or pulling heavy things you generate the strength using dynamic movements of your legs and the force is transmitted via your stable core even just sitting in the office chair all day a strong static core will help you avoid back pain in practice you rarely generate strength with you core you usually just try to keep it stable this is very different from nearly all other muscle groups so why not both do your hanging leg raises or crunches or whatever but also do your static core holds they are good for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,depends on what type of pushup you do but certainly saitamas program isnt the be all end all
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah the op missed the point of the speech at the very end saitama said that genetic modification and cybernetics were all bullshit what makes humans great is that they have the ability to change themselves out of will and dedication he pushed his body and most importantly mind to its limits and became an embodiment of power
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes you will theres nothing for your real delts its all pushing movements no pulling like pullups its the worst routine out there
GetMotivated,not_removed,mumen rider our hero is weak because he sees himself as weak as a common man he says as much himself during his battle with the sea king he knows hes weak it is in spite of his own weakness that he pushes forward thats what makes him a true hero
GetMotivated,not_removed,saitama from one punch man caped baldy
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks one punch man is anime
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a running joke what you did there i see it
GetMotivated,not_removed,lol its a joke from an anime
GetMotivated,not_removed,unless youre already an athlete running km a day will just destroy your legs edit downvote as much as you want your training schedule isnt representative for the entire population dont believe me force your entire university class of years olds to run km everyday and see the results for yourself
GetMotivated,not_removed,no ac
GetMotivated,not_removed,is he is he really full of crap considering hes the most powerful being in the universe
GetMotivated,not_removed,is there a second season coming soon
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh
GetMotivated,not_removed,bananas a day
GetMotivated,not_removed,my pants are feeling so loose i think i may have to buy a new belt genius
GetMotivated,not_removed,how have i never seen this before this is gold
GetMotivated,not_removed,i never even thought about that neat
GetMotivated,not_removed,depends for me the k would be the easy part of each would be killer although if you split then up i guess over an entire day its actually decent
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe thats the joke every other character either has super powers or uses gadgets or some other backstory saitama is one of the few that is actually shown training
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the end hes just constantly on hallucinogenes d
GetMotivated,not_removed,planks wont do as much as crunches bicycle crunches or captains chair theyre a static exercise which means you arent actively contracting and relaxing the muscles youre working on for instance chest press involves a full range of motion instead of an isometric hold planks are good for increasing endurance of your abdominals and yes they can help tone and strengthen to a degree but dynamic exercises will always be better also situps can be done without hurting your back if you use proper form that can be difficult if youre a larger person though ive no idea if you are there are a million and a half ab exercises out there pair a forward moving exercise crunches suitcases captains chair with a side to side one mason twists bicycle crunches and youll hit all of your abdominals and your obliques you may have to do side crunches to hit your obliques dead on but you can manage without doing those
GetMotivated,not_removed,who cares if it was a joke i just got some good advice
GetMotivated,not_removed,no one said where you might go bald from to not sure what i did but i regret nothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,no air con
GetMotivated,not_removed,what if i told you i can restore your hair after the fact just do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,not good enough every single day
GetMotivated,not_removed,the human body is weird
GetMotivated,not_removed,fact is you never know if you are genetically predisposed to fuckedup knees until you fuck them up what you said is true but misleading if you won the genetic lottery yes lots of everyday running will be beneficial even though diminishing returns are a thing but if you lost it which is the majority of the population you will destroy your kneecaps knee joints
GetMotivated,not_removed,okay i am trusting you with my knees
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes running is quite uncomfortable on my knees anything more than im able to squat heavy that makes my knees feel better
GetMotivated,not_removed,serious question if i start running now im about overweight will i hurt my knees or strengthen them
GetMotivated,not_removed,try swimming all the cardiovascular exercise with none of the joint impact
GetMotivated,not_removed,two stones in three months thats amazing well done
GetMotivated,not_removed,im curious how that went i recently upped my running from km to and my legs are killing me if you had pounds to burn im wondering how you managed
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah but marathon runners also have high percentage of sport injuries which is fine if you manage this properly and that would still put you far away from god tier
GetMotivated,not_removed,every dayno day off but if you can pull that offall the power to you
GetMotivated,not_removed,i loved how there was one district in tokyo that they said no one dared venture into because of some monstrously powerful beast was said to live there and it was just saitama
GetMotivated,not_removed,stank ass lookin characters can be heroes i think this is why we have genos as the secondary character he symbolizes every shounen thing saitamas character throws out the window the way genos look talk fight is embodiment of flashy shonen the way genos is always having tough battles despite getting strong etc are all shonen tropes then there is saitama looks simple talks simple fights simple i like how every shonen hero has a tragic past backstory while saitama dont even want to listen to genos story and he himself doesnt even have one just a dude with godlike powers i like it
GetMotivated,not_removed,almost squats pushups situps and i half ran those kilometersthis was day one the pushups was almost impossible since i did it after the situps and squats my whole body just vibrated when i tried to push me up and it simply didnt work much second day i only managed ish squats situps and i walked km third day i could barely get out of my bed and go to the bathroom in the morning i needed to hold on to something to sit down on the toilet becaus i almost fell down on it
GetMotivated,not_removed,no he didnt
GetMotivated,not_removed,usually do on my phone and half asleep heading home from work
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah the guy has super human power that he thinks basic strength training is the source of
GetMotivated,not_removed,fun video httpsyoutubedhzvibyqnw
GetMotivated,not_removed,well basically he attempted it for as long as possible but after days his knees gave out from running he said if you shorten it from everyday to times a week then you should be fine but doing it everyday can seriously ruin your knees
GetMotivated,not_removed,tldw just do it
GetMotivated,not_removed,that sounds mad boring
GetMotivated,not_removed,id like to know more about this can you please explain a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,sure anything is better than nothing
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre not going to get in shape because youre not going to be building any muscle doing that shit its basically entirely cardio your body needs progressive overload to build muscle unless your definition of in shape is just really thin
GetMotivated,not_removed,up to a point yes also genetics are involved and how much and what you eat
GetMotivated,not_removed,but if you do pushup a day it will do almost nothing for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,air squats saitama aint got money for weights or a gym membership
GetMotivated,not_removed,the advice goes for both types of squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,on a bike maybe running not a chance
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you run in the morning or in the afternoon
GetMotivated,not_removed,its just about making a schedule and not compromising on it this is the most frustrating part about a couple of my friends right now they commit to working out then a week later say they dont have time while posting on fb about the episodes of gilmore girls they watched the night before
GetMotivated,not_removed,considering the average human to have a volume of an action figure of said man of iron would weigh about pounds kgs quite heavy indeed
GetMotivated,not_removed,proof
GetMotivated,not_removed,and you can gain more and do it more efficiently by doing other exercises that really target the core planks are a decent beginner exercise but only get more inefficient as you do them more just forget about them completely if you ask me theres no point to doing them if you can hold it for a few minutes anyway youre barely working anything at that point youre better off doing hanging leg raises jack knives or bicycle crunches
GetMotivated,not_removed,not the person downvoting but can you source them anyway i wanna see it
GetMotivated,not_removed,no its not this isnt a routine that is going to build any significant amount of muscle if you think that youre going to get some extreme imbalances because of it youre an idiot
GetMotivated,not_removed,correct
GetMotivated,not_removed,to expand upon this originally a web comic with very poor art just a hobby for the artist it got a cult following so it was picked up by a japanese comic company with a professional artist it was then adapted to anime the title of this one punch man is taken from the main characters ability to defeat any enemy in one punch because hes so ridiculously strong and this is the training regimen he has
GetMotivated,not_removed,youd be amazed at the amount of people who take it seriously and try to follow it
GetMotivated,not_removed,webcomic
GetMotivated,not_removed,save money
GetMotivated,not_removed,res says ive downvoted u times times 😕 just made that 😈
GetMotivated,not_removed,at the same time lots of people are certain he wasnt a mortal man when he started that he had something or someone who made sure he was as powerful as he was no one could guess literally any random person has the potential in them to be a hero thats the point of the entire series a normal man who throws all the conventional ideas of power out the window
GetMotivated,not_removed,eggs a day is the key bro
GetMotivated,not_removed,what always gets me is the bonbonbonbons
GetMotivated,not_removed,bonbonbonbons is genius
GetMotivated,not_removed,monsters are born from obsession no dedication saitama spent every day doing something that was painful to him but he didnt give up obession turns into a monster no one can stand dedication makes you into a hero
GetMotivated,not_removed,is he not smears everyone in his way
GetMotivated,not_removed,not at all man can you do pushups at once at least doing them by sets when you wake up before lunch after lunch spread em out during the day and you can easily do day
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think this is the case his the only human that actually bothered to do situps pushups and squats every day for years straight
GetMotivated,not_removed,no way the ninja and old martial arts guy have trained incredibly hard their whole lives and in the flashback he went bald very suddenly i think he just randomly got godlike powers
GetMotivated,not_removed,the manga revolves around the fact that saitama makes no sense and is clueless of what happens around him you follow other peoples stories rather than his the manga presents him as exactly what he appears a noname with superpowers that came out of nowhere that make him stronger than absolutely everybody for no reason
GetMotivated,not_removed,haha just imagine that would be so sad
GetMotivated,not_removed,you seriously couldnt figure that out in your own
GetMotivated,not_removed,you shouldnt regret anything lovin the shavenaven respect
GetMotivated,not_removed,your score is already on the path to recovery my friend at the time of my reply
GetMotivated,not_removed,i had a chuckle so i gave you my upvote some people must not like laughter
GetMotivated,not_removed,and now youre at
GetMotivated,not_removed,honestly itd be much better for you to space those workouts over the week so your body has time to properly recover if by chance you were doing what the op post says youd be losing out significantly compared to someone moving through the exercises more slowly or taking days off to rest things like peak physiqueconditioning require equal parts to develope and i just wanted to put this out there for anyone thinking they arent going hard enough ect ect same goes for sleeping and eating too balance in all things
GetMotivated,not_removed,uilickanalblood no matter where i go i find you eventually please love me
GetMotivated,not_removed,if i did that id be full blown bald im trying to make this hair last as long as possible hoping to make it at least to
GetMotivated,not_removed,it is literally riddled with buttholes
GetMotivated,not_removed,kneecaps how does running injure kneecaps i thought we were talking about the joint
GetMotivated,not_removed,exercise is better for you than not exercising period its not the most important pry of weight loss but it has amazing health benefits so do anything preferably do multiple things your body was made to walk and run once you take up running the chances of having a temporary injury are high pulled muscle etc but the chances of having a permanent injury are lower than almost any other sport get a few tips on form from a coach maybe through your local shoe store like fleet feet or a relevant subreddit and go to it
GetMotivated,not_removed,i havent seen that if you can remember where you found it could you pass it along id be very interested in reading it
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion i might try it out more frequently only thing is i get ear infections from pool water and my teeth hurt weird i know ive been trying cycling still learning so hopefully that will ease off some of the pressure and stress
GetMotivated,not_removed,what about the shoulders
GetMotivated,not_removed,stone lbs
GetMotivated,not_removed,i really struggled at start just doing km a day runwalking and upped it when i started to not struggle breathing reduced calorie intake eating just once a day sometimes which is suicide so make sure to consult a doctor first for safety also been lifting lbs dumbells sets when i wake up then again after i run in the afternoon since i run after work sometimes on saturdays i do some swimming at a local pool the most important for me is my mentality i forced myself out of my comfort zone they say a broken heart do wonders already been rejected half a dozen of times in a row this past few years i thought that i should tweak a bit of myself thats where i get the motivation to do it also did already two half marathons in those months finishing it without walking gave me a feeling of satisfaction that i did improve and changed a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,you train to make yourself stronger against those for me its better to get them while trying to combat it than getting it from some accident or some other causes
GetMotivated,not_removed,had it and can speak from experience usually that only happens when your form is bad and it really isnt all that bad sure it hurts like hell but it heals rather quickly if you modify your form and take a week off while taking care of your feet
GetMotivated,not_removed,i got it dont get it
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is why she uses a treadmill less likely to trip while running and you are correct this training method would just make it so you are in good shape not god tier though it is fairly well balanced
GetMotivated,not_removed,i currently do miles daily wouldnt be a huge stretch but im good with
GetMotivated,not_removed,it isnt tokyo its city z and there is a legit monster society similar to the hero society living under the city problem is saitama keeps killing off the recruits
GetMotivated,not_removed,i agree
GetMotivated,not_removed,dude ramp up to it you arent doing yourself any favors this way good metric if you still feel like death an hour after and not just kinda sore you overdid also eat a banana it helps more than you think it would
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you know what a set is
GetMotivated,not_removed,id recommend splitting it up maybe do of each times a day and start of with a couch to the burn is good that soreness at some point makes you feel like a beast but also makes you realize why bodybuilders walk the way they do lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,good on you for trying shame you gave up though
GetMotivated,not_removed,my favorite part is the push ups
GetMotivated,not_removed,break up your exercises youre not fit enough to do it all at once like some people in the thread suggested do a third of it in the morning a third at lunch and a third at night as for running you could run in the morning and in the afternoon theres no reason to force yourself to reach a high number without prior training ramp up your training slowly and eventually itll be easy
GetMotivated,not_removed,you shouldnt reddit and drive man you might make it to the front page
GetMotivated,not_removed,iirc it is in the opm universe power basically comes from excessively doing or trying for one thing guy loves and constantly does eat crab becomes crab monster guy trains to become a superhero constantly through a training regime he views as incredibly hard which it kind of is at the beginning for him since he doesnt ease into it at all also no ac boom instead of getting fucked up joints he becomes opm
GetMotivated,not_removed,in the manga this is from obession and dedication in enough quantities makes you an embodiment of that desire he trained to become the strongest and now he is its also later revealed he literally shattered him limits like a literal thing inside you that represents your upper limits is now gone for him
GetMotivated,not_removed,well the first part is the most difficult you have to train your own asshole to talk once you do that you can pretty much say anything about any subject
GetMotivated,not_removed,essentially the body has httpsenwikipediaorgwikibioenergeticsystemscoupledreactions as you approach seconds of physical activity the aerobic system starts to take over and it quickly becomes predominant a full pushup that is all the way down and all the way up takes on average seconds so pushups on average take a minute and you are slowly starting to enter aerobic territory while the anaerobic system is starting to get tired the next seconds or so therefore the next dozen pushups are the hardest once you trained to break that barrier and you managed to reach two minutes it starts to become mostly aerobic activity and it gets easier
GetMotivated,not_removed,i disagree with the guy by the way just endurance doesnt help if you can already do more than i have pretty good overall endurance and i can do like or so like with just about everything do it more often to become better at it
GetMotivated,not_removed,are lean people not in shape
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i dont have no clue who this guy is
GetMotivated,not_removed,no its not if youre doing actual heavy squats youll be too fatigued to do them every day
GetMotivated,not_removed,well you have a chance if you won that lotteryon a bike yes much more feasible because there is basically no shock impact on your knees also if you are over bmi a bike is way better to start cardio because more weight means more shock on every step
GetMotivated,not_removed,on an acceptable bike without too many hills is like minutes or less people have longer commutes than that
GetMotivated,not_removed,knee surgery is expensive ya know
GetMotivated,not_removed,that is pretty much a matter of calories burned km for a somewhat decently trained person which if you are able to run km at a decent pace you definitely are burn around calories per kg per km so if you are lets say kg you will burn calories you are not going to burn a significant amount of muscle mass with that what will happen over time though is that your leg muscles will slowly become predominantly type fiber which is slowtwitch and aerobic
GetMotivated,not_removed,why would running cause you to lose muscle mass
GetMotivated,not_removed,you dont stop to eat as long as you eat enough cardiovascular training will not eat up anything but some calories nevertheless running constantly will just fuck up your knees
GetMotivated,not_removed,wake up at no exceptions no snooze just get up get the laziest dog on the world up turn the coffee pot on let the laziest dog in the world back in eat a spoonful of peanut butter and a cup of coffee get out of the house by even on my longest training days i am still home before take a quick shower make a smoothie and go at work before routine and patterns are life savers because even when you are fatigued in mind and body you can just hit autopilot
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah going to bed is really hard like way harder than waking up i told my lovely bride that my workout and eating schedule would never interfere with the harmony of our marriage so i wake up really early and workout while she showers and gets ready we eat the same dinners with our phones in the other room and no tv so we can enjoy each others time and company and all of our marriage responsibilities take precedent over anything else but when rolls around we are in bed and asleep she is so accommodating to me so i try my best to do the same for her
GetMotivated,not_removed,rhedidthemath
GetMotivated,not_removed,sighupvoteupvoteupvote
GetMotivated,not_removed,of strength or a picture
GetMotivated,not_removed,the point of the plank is different from that of the legraise jack knife or bicycle crunch abs are a set of multiple muscles some weaker and some more dug in some larger and stronger when you do legraises or jack knives though i admit doing bicycle crunches with either of the former would hit most of them the stronger ab muscles will do more of the work and will get stronger and you will gain more functional strength but some muscles will remain not as trained as the main ones planks on the other hand put all of them under tension assuming your lower back doesnt dip once you understand entirely the mechanics of the plank it is hardly static try holding proper form on a wet tiled floor for minutes although i am not doing planks that much compared to other ab exercises the standard elbow plank will never disappear from my regimen but for most cases your information is correct
GetMotivated,not_removed,this explains why isometricwhich the plank is exercises are not really all that effective and how the strength you build is very specific for that exact static position because isometric exercises are done in one position without movement theyll improve strength in only one particular position youd have to do various isometric exercises through your limbs whole range of motion to improve muscle strength across the range in addition since isometric exercises are done in a static position they wont help improve speed or athletic performance now thats just strength and synergy then consider the reason why we do dynamic exercises to gain muscle mass for basically all muscle groups why do we move the weights when we bench press squat bicep curl shoulder press pushups chinups etc instead of simply holding the weight in a static position that challenges the same muscles why dont we just hold a static position at the hardest part of those exercises instead of doing a full movement back and forth because it is far more effective for stimulating a higher amount of your muscle fibers leading to more muscle growth but also more functional strength static exercises can be fine as a supplement for supporting specific strength in some dynamic exercises like you may gain a benefit in deadlift from having a good strength in plank but doing plank as a main exercise in itself replacing dynamic exercises is simply a bad choice if you wish for the most optimal result you can get strong in static exercises from only doing dynamic exercises but you wont get strong in dynamic exercises from only doing static exercises imagine only doing bench press where you unrack the barbell and hold it in the same static position without lowering it or lifting it at any point youd surely get stronger at doing exactly that if you kept doing it but youd not suddenly be able to bench press pounds for reps dynamically in full range of motion because all your strength lies in that one specific static position youd also see far from the same gains in terms of muscle mass compared to doing it in the regular dynamic way of lifting the weight up and down
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont think its going to build muscle theres no progressive overload its still going to cause imbalances because the front delta are the only muscles being used in the upper body without any movements in the other smaller muscles you will get injured edit its also not going to build muscle because it allows no time for recovery since it states you must do it everyday
GetMotivated,not_removed,normally you get downvoted for asking this thanks

GetMotivated,not_removed,ah i see that makes sense
GetMotivated,not_removed,thats true but have you seen anyone lose their hair over this have you seen anyone do it this hard besides im sure he ran at his best in the km run or else he wouldnt be that fast
GetMotivated,not_removed,opm is a superheroshounen parody so yes him becoming godlike by doing just that is very likely i mean later on in the source manga theres another character that did some slightly similar stuff
GetMotivated,not_removed,those men stopped when they thought they were strong enough saitama kept pushing until his body nearly gave up on him
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmm i could imagine it being kind of funny if they show a revelation reel where he punches old women in a small supermarket but the episode was a fight against one of the skyscraper huge monsters

GetMotivated,not_removed,lol nah youre body gets used to the habit of whatever its doing it will get used to the daily training and multiply gains especially in a skilled based hobby
GetMotivated,not_removed,i will be his one and only love
GetMotivated,not_removed,every single day
GetMotivated,not_removed,hair is a sign of weakness
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont know about you but i only have two
GetMotivated,not_removed,ok youre technically correct
GetMotivated,not_removed,rowing or rowing machine maybe also good to even out the office job posture
GetMotivated,not_removed,close enough for government work
GetMotivated,not_removed,could we please use the metric system like almost everyone outside of the us
GetMotivated,not_removed,yup my bad about the city but in the anime there is an area where its rumored that the most powerful monster lives there so even the other monsters avoid the area and its all destroyed but its just saitama not some monster just a hero for fun
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope makes me think of cards
GetMotivated,not_removed,or get a better phone this keyboard likes to fuck up alot as we can see riding a bus and when im tired are not a good combo
GetMotivated,not_removed,i appreciate the sarcasm but not the implication activities over two minutes or so will definitely become cardio
GetMotivated,not_removed,wow this is interesting thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,muscular endurance is specific cardiovascular endurance isnt you can be good at or marathons but to be good at endurance pushups you need to train specific endurance of those muscles the barrier is around pushups or so in general if you do pushups more quickly which usually implies not full ones it will be more than it boils down to being able to do pushups over two minutes or so after that cardiovascular endurance becomes predominant
GetMotivated,not_removed,i personally wouldnt consider someone with a marathon runners physique which is basically what youd end up with in shape their bodies are sculpted for long distance endurance
GetMotivated,not_removed,sure but they dont really look muscular just lean with low body fat my friend is a long distance runner and is very very skinny if you looked at him i dont think youd say he looks athletic
GetMotivated,not_removed,how to become saitama
GetMotivated,not_removed,i wouldnt suggest doing it everyday either
GetMotivated,not_removed,but you are a runner ie you discovered you have genetic predisposition to run i could bike for hours every day but no way i could do daily because shitty knee genes
GetMotivated,not_removed,for the average person a run is about calories a bit under half daily intake if you dont eat enough your body will starve and shed muscle
GetMotivated,not_removed,frequent long distance running or frequent and long sessions of cardio in general will do that but is not very long distance though
GetMotivated,not_removed,and im guessing bed at is hours enough for you
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for that never really thought about the holding weights point like that youre right it is considerably more difficult to move the weights than to just hold them in place
GetMotivated,not_removed,no you wont
GetMotivated,not_removed,its a pretty good one really short and easy to follow for a newer watcher some parts are pretty funny as well
GetMotivated,not_removed,he had two comments on this thread
GetMotivated,not_removed,your comment gave me and my children cancer but its k
GetMotivated,not_removed,res says i upvoted you times 😕 just made that 💃
GetMotivated,not_removed,😒😒😒 copypasta 🍝 is for weaklings who cant reach my level of dankness 😎 bring some original shit 👍😎 or gtfo 😡👎
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh and none of that protein crap bro
GetMotivated,not_removed,wut
GetMotivated,not_removed,hmm its far fetched but so are most of the shows backstories
GetMotivated,not_removed,well if this wasnt supposed to be an uplifting sub id insult you
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,bruh i went to make coffee come back to this
GetMotivated,not_removed,no at any age and especially older you can think youre hot shit and go hard every day but i know plenty of people whove seriously hurt themselves thinking they were invincible when all they needed was to slow the fuck down
GetMotivated,not_removed,til teenagerd are saiyans
GetMotivated,not_removed,get away from him you homewrecker
GetMotivated,not_removed,i havent heard about the majority of people being genetically predisposed to knee injuries most people that i know with knee injuries got them from when something specific went wrong usually involving twisting for uninjured knees the analogy ive heard is that its like a machine running in a groove and repetition slightly deepens the groove making it more likely that it will continue to stay in it but an injury that slightly changes the shape of the knee or the angle at which the bones come together makes it harder for it to stay in the groove
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks for following up i have gone through periods where i run or more every week for several weeks at a stretch it didnt feel like anything bad was happening it actually felt pretty good but i also dont know that i would be able to feel it it also wasnt for years at a stretch
GetMotivated,not_removed,will try that thanks
GetMotivated,not_removed,so its more than two stone
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think i agree with you
GetMotivated,not_removed,oh i know lets put it up to a popular vote and then let the electoral college decide
GetMotivated,not_removed,what he is getting at is rather than doing pushups at once break them down into sets you can do sets of with a minute break in between or you can do any variation such as sets of or go to failure as many times as you can ie using sets will let you get more volume in your exercise rather than trying to blast it out all at once for running id recommend something similar like a couch to program thatll have you alternate between running and walking it increases the proportion of running over time as you develop cardiovascular strength anyways good luck
GetMotivated,not_removed,sorry i was feeling a tad frisky last night
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre welcome
GetMotivated,not_removed,im confused why someone whose body is sculpted for long distance endurance wouldnt be considered in shape
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe not but if i were to look at olympic runners id say they look athletic
GetMotivated,not_removed,you said the advice goes for both you can do air squats everyday lol
GetMotivated,not_removed,i would edit if i were you but comment surgery is expensive ya know
GetMotivated,not_removed,it wasnt in the beginning but after a few weeks you get used to it i was never a morning person anyways though so it doesnt really matter i guess
GetMotivated,not_removed,do you just go around downvoting him
GetMotivated,not_removed,happy to help my dude
GetMotivated,not_removed,he says basically train until youre bald thats pretty intense imo
GetMotivated,not_removed,¯ツ¯
GetMotivated,not_removed,uilickanalblood is everywhere
GetMotivated,not_removed,
GetMotivated,not_removed,make sure your coffee is poison free
GetMotivated,not_removed,you might be right but some teenagers are out there doing or practice on school days you think the crew team busting out a bunch of before similar calisthenics or the wrestling team carrying each other on their backs for miles plus other conditioning is daunted by and moving their bodyweight a few hundred edit left out a full half a sentence maybe i added too much back when youre doing something every day your body adapts sure most year olds wont be going out and doing it but the op volume doesnt seem unrealistic for anyone young or gifted with decent control of their physical health realistic easy peasy
GetMotivated,not_removed,i dont mean working out to the extreme limit everyday or heavy lifting but more so the ability to run everyday and not fatigue from the exercise of playing a sport everyday as easily as you would years later and being able to recover in a days time from the fatigue as long as you slept and ate of course i
GetMotivated,not_removed,not predisposed to knee injuries but running every day for some meaningful mileage is going to fuck you up unless you are genetically gifted in that regard what you said is definitely true but you have to consider the rest factor you need to rest between imposed demands or adaptation does not occur and injury happens running every day for for the vast majority of people is going to lead to problems due to lack of adequate rest also yeah if you damage your knee joint in some way your chances of future injuries pretty much skyrockets unless surgeries but they are usually expensive
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre welcome
GetMotivated,not_removed,two and a bit
GetMotivated,not_removed,thanks might use this to help improve my cardio and work on my extreme laziness
GetMotivated,not_removed,man its been hours i had already forgotten all about that anyway sometimes my asshole actually does talk
GetMotivated,not_removed,because youre basically a weak heart away from being a holocaust victim
GetMotivated,not_removed,because being in shape means that you also look good
GetMotivated,not_removed,yeah but you can up the difficulty of those as well just like you can with weighted squats
GetMotivated,not_removed,we agree then
GetMotivated,not_removed,i downvoted him when i see him
GetMotivated,not_removed,except for with me when i need him
GetMotivated,not_removed,is he ali g
GetMotivated,not_removed,the hell is ali g
GetMotivated,not_removed,why your name has nothing to do with drinking poison
GetMotivated,not_removed,i think rdangerrobot is talking about recovery time with regard to maximizing benefits by resting youre going at it from the standpoint of stamina sure someone can go balls to the wall and work out hard every day but as far as gaining muscle optimally and reaping the conditioning benefits they need restrecovery days
GetMotivated,not_removed,your are absolutely correct a lot of top level athletes will warn about over training but heres the thing they are top level athletes miles a week running is not even close to what many amateur marathoners do every week those other numbers can be done in one or two sets for an average athlete sure if you go from a lifetime of sedentary lifestyle and try to do this all at once its gonna break you if you arent ridiculously overweight split this up over the course of the day go every other day at first and slowly ramp up i bet within months most people could be doing this
GetMotivated,not_removed,youre awesome thank you
GetMotivated,not_removed,two stones and a pebble
GetMotivated,not_removed,maybe ditch the anime routine and try to get yourself to a good basic fitness try to get to say running sets of push ups of pull ups every other day as for sit ups i think i read someone here saying theyre bad for your back and planks and leg raises are better im sure someone more knowledgeable than me can chime in
GetMotivated,not_removed,wouldnt that only happen if you didnt eat what you needed to as well surely just being lean with a healthy diet wouldnt get you in that sort of way
GetMotivated,not_removed,runners dont look good
GetMotivated,not_removed,how unless youre talking about pistol squats which is a completely different movement
GetMotivated,not_removed,nope analblood made a reference
GetMotivated,not_removed,you fucking serious
GetMotivated,not_removed,shhh
GetMotivated,not_removed,miles a week is far more than any amateur marathoner i know runs usually about half that in the peak of training i agree with the rest of this though source am amateur marathoner
GetMotivated,not_removed,to be honest i would probably say something like two stone and about two kilos in real life
GetMotivated,not_removed,id say its probably pretty difficult to maintain a caloric surplus doing that exercise regime every day were talking about a good calories extra per day on top of your tdee so like calories average just to maintain your weight anyway my definition of in shape is not healthy its looks as though they go to the gym obviously i am not implying that doing this will make you unhealthy although it will probably fuck your knees up
GetMotivated,not_removed,not in my opinion too lanky
GetMotivated,not_removed,generally the body type featured by most endurance runners isnt considered to be all that attractive
GetMotivated,not_removed,you say that like its bad thing
GetMotivated,not_removed,yes
