GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it is not a scam but maybe the trade offer is buggy cause he already traded it and you may not be able to accept
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,steam does that quite often you probably cant accept the trade offer and it will return error if you can accept though you got yourself the awp you are looking for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,probably a steam bug if you try to accept it you should get a error message
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,seems like youre salty as fuck you didnt invest into them so many salty kids on here if people keep buying them for then then why cant he ask for it upvoted op ignore these fucks

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,if you ever get a low float mw let me know looking at upgrading my float from a
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,cant trade those here thats for sure
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the best way to trade rl items to csgo items is to go to rl steam forum and make a post at least in my opinion you can also use their exchange reddit to sell for pp and then buy csgo stuff
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,some people on rrocketleagueexchange are willing to trade using cs stuff generally theyll only pay for higher tier items like painted wheels and black market decals though but id recommend taking a look there i managed to get some csgo keys for a few things when they released crates in rl also be sure to use a middleman since theres no trading via steam
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,theese knifes was not more than keys weeks ago idk why owners trying to raise prices up nice highball
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,around keys i can offer u since float is not the best d

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,are you fucking crazy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sold keys fair price imo at this quantity all yall lowball people be complaining guy was quick and friendly added and will definitely sell to again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ayo i have a redline you can spice it up w kinda bored of it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have a offer but did not mention
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you could maybe get a howl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dont trade on alias or slayers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have a guy wanting to gamble it bc its over priced on a certain site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,there are already a lot of good explanations of what one is but id recommend checking out one for yourself this subreddit is great for trading passively while trade servers are good for trading actively all servers consist of people advertising via text and voice chat they all also have private rooms you can use to discuss trades with people without others interfering with your trade most of them also have nice and friendly people on them and using one in addition to reddit speeds up trading a lot id personally reccomend cgn tgp and alias in that order im kind of biased towards cgn since im a moderator on there but tgp is also a great server and has a lot of friendly people id also reccomend alias because theyve got good staff but often have too many people so may be kind of overwhelming or toxic if its your first time on one id highly reccomend trying one out though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i love it when people use steam analyst for how many keys they want its really funny
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,damn i never knew that there is a full black double sided kara doppler they look so sick good thread btw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i hate people advertising their as fake black pearls they dont even look like black pearls
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,flip knife dopplers can be fake bps
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,thanks for your time writing this upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well said
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what do you think of this kara
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,therefore a with loads of black doesnt really look like a black pearl imo it looks better i agree that it looks better
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i dont think the stigma is against fake black pearls and fake fi i think its to people either a not actually knowing what a fbp or ffi looks like or b knowing that their knife isnt a ffi or fbp yet trying to pass it off as one honestly i dont like the term because it is overused on things that arent actually fbp or ffi
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what i like best about fake black pearls is that they dont exist
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,still waiting for quicksell stigma
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,instead of calling things such controversial terms like fake black pearl itd probably be best to just use a term like black ps both of these are arbitrary user defined words but the latter doesnt carry such a negative connotation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,who cares its just the term the thing that matters is what the knife looks like not whether its a black ps or fake black pearl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i used to say fake black pearl when i have money only for then i got a real bp and never said it again ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you dont understand you cant just say fake black pearls exist its a term made up by traders like pink galaxy which is highly misused and doesnt have a specific pattern for it its just a fucking term used to make their knives sound good fucking pointless post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,httpimgurcomaysafu ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,how much this fake black pearl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,bot elma
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol you are an idiot u want way too much

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i dont think a difference is a lot when you sell an item worth keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,that guy is buying tiger tooths to buy a high tier item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i think the ak is known as pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,welli dont know about prices on some other real cash sitesbut i know on lounge and here and my thought is this you can put the price whatever the fuck you want now if someone buys howl for keys and not on some real cash site for is his fucking problem you have googleyou have reddityou have internet that is full of this informations real cash is real cashand items are items now if you can get somewhere cheaper for real cash then from that guy for keys then go and get it oh waityou cant cause you have items and not real cash now you need to invest days to sell your items on normal prices so you may be able to get enough to buy on those cash sites now i can not say that those key prices for some items are not funnybut yet i still cant say that they have no reason for it there are people who have full inventorys in items like black pearlsrubyshowlsapphires for which they have invested major cash to buy them now they own market on those and they can to whatever the fuck they want about it he has ityou want it now if you want ityou pay for it thats that psdont blame me here for supporting maniulators or something cuz im not im just here to say my though how all that works logically now cause its not morall thats other stuff ps ps now i expect that you are gonna start fighting manipulation like you people did with crown foil by downvoting those howl posts

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i started out with a dollar steam card that i got for my birthday and i thought it would be a cool thing to try my luck out on some cases i opened phoenix cases and i didnt get anything even close to a dollar then being the jobless year old i was decided i would mow the lawn for some money to afford my csgo case addiction that was now forming now after years of trying to open more cases betting skins that arent worth anything and trying to get lucky a little while ago i opened my first red skin an battle star i had no personal attachment to it and decided to go gambling with it the first time i gambled it i went from an skin to a dollar atomic alloy fn i decided to call it quits for that day being ahead a few bucks but two days later i decided that i would try to make more money off of my original battle star i put it up and lost it all in a matter of minutes now im sitting here typing this message with an awp hyperbeast ft and a deagle kumicho dragon as the most expensive items in my inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so i guess the price manipulation is now going the other way

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,no by directly selling you will get less i can assure you that high rep traders buy for like maximum best case scenario usually its you are better of selling it on the site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ay
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,either be safe use that site earn a little less but at least you got the money or be greedy earn more but all got scammed in the end pick it yourself make sure dont post a cry post here if you choose the second way and end up got scammed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sell using the site honestly think about it even if you sell at each thats around more cents youd get than from selling it on the site but say you get scammed once you lose more than you would of by selling on the site but if you can do it safely then do it on paypal since you save like d goodluck my friend
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,use that site instead
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,if you sell on a third party market make sure you get premium membership to reduce tax from to will save you money overall if you are selling that many keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just use toilet paper on one with a dirty hole
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,indeed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,trust me dude being greedy for a little bit more per key means nothing when you get scammed for more than you wouldve lost if you sold slightly lower priced sell on that site source my wallet
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,your two options are using the big site or going to a reputable key buyer with dozens of pages of reputation both are pretty straight forward and youd go first in either case no need to for personal information or anything of that sort
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,all trustable people i know are byuing for like with premium on this big site you get atleast depending on the key
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,remove names of trade servers pls
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,use that site

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hey you are posting here too often we currently allow sale posts per day you can read the rules here httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules you may post again in hours and minutes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can confirm quicksell had this knife myself and sold for alot more
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im not op p but tbh i do see people do it from time to time this hotrod is really beat up for its float tho mines got an and is arguably cleaner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wow have no idea who went first first person with gets it this time i watch
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nice vote manipulation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,opskins come at me brah
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why is op banned here i wonder which mental challenged kid came up with that rule
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,with all the knowledge in the internet about scamming why would you do paypal twice that site that stats with ops is legit and worked
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dont worry ive lost cad from three separate scams needless to say ive learned my lesson about trading in your case always use a trusted site like opskins theres no way to get scammed there even if you lose a little money from taxes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,would you like to show me the rule that says trading bots arent allowed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,oh yeah cant forget the auction rule that doesnt technically exist
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,pretty nice if you dont want ill take
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just cash out using op way easier
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,on opskins the most popular irl money site the cheapest result for case key is a flat though keep in mind they take a commission so at the end of the day it works out to for you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so as i stated technically it isnt a rule because it isnt in the rule page
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so how do we know if its against the rules then whats the point of even having that page if only half the stuff are on there
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why do people not realize the fee on opskins is worth the peace of mind of not getting scammed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hmm next time use opskins lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,httpstwittercomtwitchraids
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,gofestmen
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dont use paypal period unless you are using opskins or very reputable traders opskins takes most reputable traders who will cashout your inventory will pay around mp for the bundle
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so theres ops a fuck tonne of very reputable traders that buy for very reasonable prices or you could sell for keys and sell through either of the aforementioned methods i used to have sympathy for situations like these but at this point its literally just as easy to find a reputable means of selling as it is to get scammed sorry for your loss of cash but dont get back into trading

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,days of the same post same price no offers dont you think your price is dumb lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeh this is true only suggested it because a while back on phantomlords steam lul he was just asking people to send him bulk offers of keys for each if you can find someone to buy for each then its great if not then opskins is probably better since youre gonna get per key on average
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,how much does op take i see that keys on their get listed for each
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,bestway is to sell to local ppl from ur country for cash straight if demand is high enough if not the second best betsafety wise as well would be on that popular website that starts with op

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,there was an extension similar to this for opskins which was a scam which is why this op site now has a warning on the front page about extensions you can see some info this seems to be similar nearly identical to that one it just hijacks your trade and a fake bot tries to take your items ive reported the extension to google other people should too to try taking it down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,same guy tried it with me lootmarket should put a warning on its frontpage
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this method became very popular lately someone adds you on steam and offers overpay fair price for your items via party site like op after agreements scammer asks you to download install an extension from chrome store extension might look legit like float checker or some other shit in the end youll receive an offer from scammers bot
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wont even sell for gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,if anyone with access pass on xchange could post metjms of the first karambits

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,y sold mine for so maybe a bit highercan u add me pls
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,for keys you can get my stickered ak it also has a nametag check my post out
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,when checking from market you dont take aftermarket key prices thats only when u buy outside of the steam interface eg op bit or sellers the main reason is because teres steam tax
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have an ak for keys here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hey ucamgibbosu your post is in violation of our rules you must include a buyout in the post body of every thread posted unless there has been an exception made by the moderators for any particular reason please also take this time to httpwwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules for future reference thank you very much for your understanding
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this subreddit atm lounge
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it takes upvotes or to get to the front page its nothing special lol i suggest you delete this shit thread

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hehe u can trade dragonlores fts for akibahras on double ive seen like there ofcourse it was like months ago now the bank is kinda bugged but u might get lucky
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it doesnt explain the whole point of value ak ch just even more ridiculous than but in general its same shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,and again i dont see why people want this skin it looks like shit compare to things that you can get for keys mate in future if you have nothing to say dont say anything supply and demand bullshit explain me why people want this skin why people agree to pay keys you have no idea why you just trade it and happy with price you dont know and you dont care why it worth so much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,he is a complete cunt dont bother replying to him hes not worth your time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i was just giving my thoughts i basically dont care about your opinion and i was not going to argue you have thoughts of all you trying promote your item thats why you answered you trying so hard to sell this skin so you reply on every comment why i rude because you have no idea why price is so high but you trying to protect your item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,bruh this dude with asking for doesnt even use the qs tag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,keep your titles relevant to what is being soldwhat you want to buy unnecessary attention grabbers will just lead to the removal of your post

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,support is a verb so its thats support not a support furthermore help is not a synonym of support support means to share the weight of a burden such as moral support
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,because every adjective is a clickbait
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,and last if u realised he pricecheck was fake and prolly the guy answered was his friend or something just saying if u noticed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,when youre so smart tell me what prices csgoexchange uses because it says my knive is worth usd meanwhile sa price is usd atm and market price even lower you should also freaking realize that there are ppl that dont have knowledge as you might for example have so next time calm the fck down and explain it to the people more politely

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this is why shouldnt be allowed unlimited internet access i know what buyout means they dont need to be told the bo is not firm because the buyout is just a price that i would instantly sell for also due to the way reddit works its not uncommon that people wont even see this post unless they search for it want to know why i didnt put it up for keys its because i dont want keys for it i wont sell it for less than the full price of keys im not looking for a quick sell so i can wait and keep searching until someone buys it for keys or until someone offers me a trade i want to accept now if youd calmly fuck off we can be done with this

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,to be honest whilst this sucks if you are prepared to go and buy items for someone to make a trade happen you are setting yourself up for a fall
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so did you pay more than market for the awp if he was that specific and you paid more than market you may have been had
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,udcjj

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this is overpriced
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sick knife would buy it if your price was lower
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,too many specialty items for trade to be purely bot based
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nope just take advantage of the trade sites sapphires and rubies and bpearls are not frequently sold so their prices can vary just take advantage that the trade sites have static prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i totally agree with your post i feel like bots and sites take control over trading they grind out every cent of profit out of trades and since everyone knows and uses them they ruin the profit margain for us traders all we can do is avoid them and look for real people maybe we can keep the community up and running by protesting against these sites i hope one day valve will take action and shut down all these bots to make tradig great again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they started to killig trading already imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,trading died when valve killed lounge and all the loungers came here

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i am a nip fanboy and i would like to pay a little bit more for the maybe key
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,as many said dont get scammed dont get sharked ask someone you trust and does a lot of trading for advice maybe ppl will know your not familiar with all the jazz when you try to sell it it is worth a hell lot lucky guy but as many stated get rid asap lore is a new skin it will drop in price as more lores get onto the market maybe selling it on opskins wouldnt bet the absolute worst thing to do you might not get maximum pay but you get and you wont get scammed for which alone in itself is quite a big advantage i managed to unbox the same knife in bs and had literally hundrets trying to scam me i think i reported at least glws
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i would hit up rofl he will be more than interested in the knife or on steam both of them are high tier traders if you want a fair price for you knife just make sure you add their real accounts
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,use btc to accept currency and a reddit mod for middleman do not accept an add from some random saying they are going to help use the middleman links on this site congrats and good luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the most ez way you give it to me i will tell you d check float exchange or csgozone check value here opsks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,there are of them of them on bots owned by seized the pro and the last by op
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,another trade that will disappear into reddits abyss knife with an acceptable float for a flip knife wanting an knife in return gl u sir
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,its low float and decently stable
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,amazing unboxing here are some tips i would sell it asap as the price will drop and continue to drop do not trade it to a middleman as most of the time people will give you an impersonator profile of a steam admin there is no such thing as a bugged item just dont trade outside the steam window dont sell for real money to anyone on steam even if they have cash rep it can be faked if i were you i would sell it on the best website that takes commission get premium so its only and feature your item trust me getting only of grand is better than of it dont trust anyone if you have any qs or want edited screens feel free to add me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,with a knife like that either cash out through op or not at all just be safe with it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,all of you just remember how metjm responded if we want change voice it well i guess thats it the mods tried to force me to give up my domain and rename the service to globaloffensivetradetools and threatened to ban my sitescreens from the subreddit if i didnt i obviously didnt accept that wtf then they said theyd ban the screenshots if i didnt remove the logo and hosted them on a different site my counter offer was to make a login for users with the flair on this subreddit give them something like limited premium but the mods declined my website is still free its faster than ever before im not even limiting the amount of screens a user takes per day this is obviously not about profit since they told me i could keep running it like i do now just under their name im not sure whats going on but it feels personal or its just another forum admin power trip i dunno either way im done with this subreddit this will be my last post here thanks for all the kind words ive heard here over the last months you the users are awesome umetjm

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im going to go ahead and guess that you bought this for a high af price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol imma win this niggas hawt ak
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you do realize youre high
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so how many thousands of dollars is your inventory worth of course you can make a fuck ton of profit with an inventory that is already that size this guy said he currently has keys do you think its realistic for him to double that in weeks like your profit would be if he was starting with bloody keys like you of course he could for him making the same percentage of his inventory that you do would be like keys in weeks and he cant make as high a percentage as you because the smaller your inventory the harder it is to make profit this is like a billionaire saying i dont understand why people complain about minimum wage jobs like of course you dont cunt youre basically getting free money at this point
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the mods are a joke they shadow deleted my thread with out writing anything its a fucking subreddit not applying for a fucking job its unrealy how many bs rules there are here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can i add you on steam about somethign for mins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,interested in a blue top case hardened battlescarred httpsmetjmnetunuotfnjpg
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,world ranking lists are explicitly disallowed as they have more often than not been used in price manipulation you cannot state it is a pattern ch or rank crimson web or best slaughter you can state that it has the best float on csgoexchange currently or worst float currently of csgoexchange
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i think around
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,market p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,added u redditor
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i can offer you my ak case hardend with an amazing galaxy pattern if you are
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah ill add u d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,even with youre asking market for a half blue bowie n o t g o n n a h a p p e n n o t g o n n a h a p p e n

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yo if ur willing to drive the price down to hmu
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,no its not fair i had a one lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nonono shut the fuck up we do one of these every month and the results never change karma hungry smh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the goal is to maintain the highest possible amount of real money post cashout while keys is fastest the way i found to get the highest amount possible is to sell the items themselves on opskins or if i have keys convert that into uniquenice stickers or bta float skins and then list those
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,quicksell gg
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have a bayo max pink not i was advertising ill do right now if ur intererested
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the prince of india strikes again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,was this done via a live trade invite to trade method or a trade offer that was sent by the scammer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,s c a r y
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,how the heck in order to trade log onto someones steam he must have accessed mobile authenticator thing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,made a video recently where someone was able to change his ingame knife without leaving the server he also said something about him spoofing those items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,maybe you should post this in general csgo probably gonna take more attention
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this is really worrying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,tldr dont trade anymore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so if im understanding this right the scammers manage to some how manipulatespoof the data sent to steam that is in turn displayed to the victim the victim sees the item both in the offer window and in the confirmation window but no item is actually delivered wouldnt this require an exploit either within the steam client or within the item database and if it has been going on as long as suggested why has valve not chosen tobeen able to patch it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,question does his inventory look different on exchange than it does on steam cause i always check exchange for float verificationetc and this hasnt happened to me ever
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,holy shit this is real plz tell me its joke actualy one of my friends tell me same story he get offer accept than dont find item on his inv ps one glich happened to me weeks ago i trade awp elite build to httpimgurcomxywyxbw but after i check my inv and dont find that pistol and keys but still have awp than i check his inv and here wath awp w same stickers and float after he change some stickers but i still could play with this awp on game after later i get my keys and dealge and want to ask they get any trash after accept trade or just nothing demn this with spoof packets looks like ingame cheats thats why he always on csgo probly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well i guess the site wont vanish suddenly first of all there would be a letter from valve like there was for the other sites so i guess right now the risk is not that high
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,do u wanna sell your knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,before the rule was announced maybe we can get an update of rules when you guys decide its a rule i feel like mods are adding rules left and right and dont even make an announcement about said rules
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,that price is horrendous
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,pm if keys run out i will transfer more over nigga those keys are not leaving your inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they will if people stop panicking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,no need to be mad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nobody really knows because future events might change everything positive or negative but i think its clear items wont go back to their original value if they ever start rising again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,literally most pointless rule ever because everyone already knows what site you are talking about regardless if i say op site or opsk im fine but i cant write out the full site name stupid af
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,do you interested in with max black aka fake blackpearl like ur fake sapphire

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just curious why cant we say that site or any other gamble site but we can say exhange also has a key selling service and lounge i never understood this it also has gambling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,remindme
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,atm people seem either hold of untill more stable prices or invest due to low prices so it comes down to invest as much as you feel comfortable with

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ban for inappropriate title incoming in
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,co half a piece of chicken
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,from what i saw there cant be a tier list because it caused a shitfiesta like the case hardened rankings i saw the mod said it had to do with price manipulation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,then why dont you pm the moderator team they probably have their reasons and its unfair to pressure them by publicly calling them out theyre just volunteers trying to keep this place from burning no need to try and start flamewars
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i bet you put lots of effort into that guide and it must be pretty annoying to have it removed multiple times but isnt it better to send a modmail as we wont be able to to help you as we neither know the guide nor the ruleset gl getting your problem sorted out
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nazism
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lmao

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i know its a bit off topic but im quick selling this ak for sticker price it has vp holo on wood and navi non holo on body both kato ss
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,other one sold for what or in items not bad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yes there is a harm in allowing users to offer over the buyout it is unfair to the user who sent an offer for buyout first to have other users to send offers over the buyout later and to have their offer decline as a result i er hold on while i find the single tiny violin i have lying around for stuff like this thats some entitled bullshit but whatever opinions are like assholes after a thorough and deligent investigation though it is evident what transpired two words div manipulation a lazy mans example i am not going to go into the specific scenarios that i am sure you have lined up because i do not have the time however we always maintain an open mind during every report since we recognize exceptions do occur rarely at some point you have to mentally yield to how painfully bad this rule is written and how far it jogs from its originally intended purpose i cant really blame you for running from it that doesnt mean the rule isnt really badly written and almost completely unenforceable in anyway fair and meaningful way
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this post in general summarizes exactly why loungers ruin everything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,haha ok man whatever you say if you are just going to be rude i am not going to waste any of my time further to answer your questions no one is forcing you to use this subreddit how am i specifically being rude im pointing out that instead of actually answering directed points you are running from them now im rude too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,maybe use the fuckin google omg i hate these topics
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sold them all for pure btw was a howl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,not sure either i tried to make a discussion about it it front paged then got removed with no response from the mods lots of people with good reasons for why the rule sucked schmedy bailed when faced with repeated attempts to get him to actually defend the rule with logical factual answers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i still think its dumb that you can not express interest on pc threads even if you explicitly state you are interested when op gets a price check you are in the wrong
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,good price take my upvote
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well i got two karambits fade float keys doppler phase pink galaxy keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,maybe depends on the items send a trade and ill take a look
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wow reading is fundamental
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ty for the offer i will co it but sold for yesterday and they have rised so i dont want to do lower than that ty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,do it pussy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they refuse to discuss how bad these rules are this sub gained popularity because other options were awful and this one was easy to use and accessable all of the perks that came with it now i wonder how long until the community moves on again outpost lounge subreddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hahahhaaha its a max fake dude learn your shit before posting please ty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ok send them to an admin so they can tell you its a max fake

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i love these they enable you to tradefastmen but in all honesty sometimes i just want keys and dont want to wait or have people argue with my prices so these bots have aided me greatly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ayy lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,okay sry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,but i said that when he will know the price he can pm me im not sharking or offering
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,co now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sites like csgosell are good for cent items in bulk bots like httpsteamcommunitycomidcsgoskinbuying are good for higher teir stuff i use them if i get an exceptionally good skin offer and i want quick keys without haggling with a buyer theyre very legal and were originally taken from a autoaccept script
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,oh my
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,there are also sites that offer that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,a normal qs bot would be nice but what id really like is a qs bot for items that are not only worth market value such as a expensive stickered ak for this it would have to recognize and calculate an average price for the stickers as well i dont know if this is possible but this would be amazing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,back to lounge

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hunstman blue steel ww
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,didnt downvote it before but ill be sure to do so now and ill downvote your future posts where you attempt to sell this badly positioned kato
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,that kara blue gem is so overpriced imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i would say op site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the easiest thing is sell everything for keys and then sell those on op skins cash out via paypal done there might be more effective ways but this is the easiest imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the overpowered site would honestly be the best way get a monthlong premium pass then sell all your items there
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,op skins get the money on paypal then you can transfer it into your bank account from there if you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,send me offer and ill cash out for you go fast men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,seems like you are a friend of the seller
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lounge has arrived

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,market manipulation gofastmen
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have a holo for sale at vox on scope mystik col if interested ps sorry for saying this i your thread but you were not interested by his ffer so i figured id give it a shot ­
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,technically mods dont allow names in title unless you write karambit case hardened name just hope they dont see your post however the price you ask is your choice and they wont care about that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you literally told me to go fuck myself because i said that keys is too much for an item that ive seen a better version of sell for and im the immature one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i upgrade u overpay men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,go fest men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,my point was ayy lmao is clearly a meme and intended to be used in such a manner you can try to be a smartass about it but you know what i mean
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i am paying for any gut doppler
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,never knew that was rule sorry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why did u downvote me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ignorance can be fixed by learning but you cant fix stupid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,should of bothers me so much does that make me a dick
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you should leave his name in so i can find his account and block him to make sure he doesnt waste my time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i guess you have to be a pretty weird guy to begin with if you have a low float negev collection
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well he couldve offered you a lot though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,enjoy brexit man no more benefits
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,do people still buy awp asiimov full price ft first time using reddit so idk where to ask sorry full price in keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,til that negev collecting is a thing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,enjoy brexit no more benefits that was gold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,did you post the negev somewhere or did he found you through exchange or somehow i always wonder when people add me about skins i never posted anywhere especially a negev seems rather odd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i would at least have asked him for the price and if his offer is shit you still can say no
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hes a dirty trash can full of poop
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i wouldve ended that conversation long before it got that far is it for sale na why because its not for sale deleted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,thats how csgo trading is u meet a lot of nice and cool people but you also meet the worst guys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,probably a kid that gets everything they want so they are not capable of understanding no
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,enjoy brexit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so bye and enjoy brexit i lold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,would be the greatest if the guy in the conversation saw this post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah i never understood the logic behind the retaliation after someone is blatantly saying that their skin or whatever they have is not for sale whining like a little arse doesnt help you get your item though it is nice to have a few traders who are friendly and dont always go fest on you why be a dick trader when you can be nice right helps you with not only your client but your overall appeal
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just tell them to fuck off
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so you also had an encounter with him let you tell you my experience with this kid i have a nearly finished st stickered loadout stickers are flammables firestarters crowns etc and i found out that he had one skin that wouldve fit perfectly into my loadout even for a gun that i didnt have a skin yet so im going on and add him negotiate he overpriced it quite a bit and i was willing to pay more than its actually worth but not the full amount that he wanted for it at some point he messaged me and wouldnt stop slandering around because he was just recently banned on this subreddit for asking for upvotes which is clearly stated that its a violation against the rules so he goes on and tells me that hes going to quit csgo and i have to take his offer i kindly decline and tell him im firm on my already overpaying offer he goes on and deletes me heres where i made a mistake i commented on his profile and somehow made him readd me i really wanted that skin in my collection i went on to offer a little bit more but still not the full amount he wanted because it was just overpriced i told him to keep me added and post it for trade again once hes unbanned on here days after he was unbanned he told me to send my offer and that hell accept it an hour after sending i ask him whether hes going to accept or not and he tells me that he had lost his phone obviously lying at that point the next day my offer as well as the skin were gone he had sold it to someone else i guess it was my mistake to even believe him but i just wanted this skin it would really have fit into my loadout i hate people
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,because of traders are just plain assholes

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i dont get it your buyout is and your co
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you can get out of csmoney lad d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,please f off from reddit trading u lon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it depends of the collection which will be in the operation but no operation has been announced yet so no need to be worried
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,mostly proces drop due to people selling their skins to buy the operation itself only thing that drops later are the skins that are being dropped in the operation so if your inventory isnt full off skins from collections that are being dropped than you have nothing to worry about
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i know of people are panic selling with every change and are like new operation lets sell because prices will drop so hard but i checked for the last three operations no drop at all prices did go up mostly nbsp made a graph for you source is steamanalyst example with op wildfire httpiimgurcomvdzfatmjpg
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well if we will have the same drops as in the last operations those skins will drop for sure initially we will see a drop on lower priced items like redlines etc since people sell them to get the operation pass but those should recover soon higher tier skins that are not dropped in the operation should not be affected
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,how much for gut sapphire what you add for this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dont kid yourself

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,either way my offer was worth over keys and you still added over keys worth of items like a dirt bag scammer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,where are the quicksells
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,anyone know how much this is worthcrimson web mw karambit webs float thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the way i see it is its steam doing their part to look like they are trying to in gambling war so if the shit hits the fan media wise they can say look but we tried this to stop it i feel like it might be a little set back but there will be ways around what ever the implement i feel that sites that involve gambling could be effected in some ways but it wont stop sites like opskins etc you might have to do things differently but ultimately steam wont want to kill one of their biggest cash cows which is resale of items on steam they know that it will be a huge loss to their income if the market crashes and no company in their right mind will do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well atleast opskins is still going to be up to cashout irl right guys right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i dont give a fuck about the gambling sites but i just hope theyll let op continue running really dont wanna have to resort to selling keys directly to strangers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,all of it wont happen instantly opskins wont just go down over night it will take weeks if not months pull out while you can
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,will opskins keep working as usual
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,for anyone worried about cashing out on a certain site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,doctormckaydeveloper minutes ago stickied comment we dont do anything illegal nor do we do anything gamblingrelated so well continue operation as normal
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can people read it specificly targets gambling nothing to do with opskins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i think you can withdraw i could withdraw from csgodouand other sites when i had ban so you can withdraw but you cant deposit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this is good news and can healthy both for trading and investment gambling cancer will go away and make cs what it was no more manipulations for gambling sites no more sellout youtubers and pro players healthy market and prices just if we all dont panic and see it as a chance i hope most people are not stupid enough to ruin everything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,when i need to get profit asap to cashout my last on op when exactly is this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sell skins guys while you can haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,cant wait to make bank from kids panic selling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,id you want to get rid f them hen just send them to me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they wont fall skins like kara doppler dragon lores tiger tooths etc will drop
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,withdraws are down on wild rn fml
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im done with trading im cashing out send me trade offers for keys if you want me skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,correct me if im wrong but isnt this a significantly good thing i constantly see people complaining about gambling sites and the way they run the csgo economy all this update does is fuck gambling sites also the author wrote and steam does not have a system for turning ingame items into real world currency it sounds like opsk will not be negatively effected by this update steam has only made a disclaimer they dont personally provide a cashing out service like opsk to steam users imo this update will promote a healthy economy within csgo no more rapid price drops ie fn kara dopplers or random overpriced skins st fn poop knives due to their coin value on gambling sites items will finally begin to settle at their real value cant think of a better term atm some prices will fall while others rise this overall a great update imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,will opskins still work
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,na i believe him same way u sharked a kid for a ww reverse scar about weeks ago when they were massive price spike and resold for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what about opskins and bitskins

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol you crack me up your price is shit and no one wants to buy from a highballing rude illogical potato i genuinely believe you are that stupid to believe your own lies like when you say that i lowballoffer when the reality is i didnt even offer i merely asked for your price then tried to explain unfortunately u could not understand because your a potato the pricing that you were selling at was unreasonable i mean you claim to have co hahaha was mine one of them since i asked you what is the price im assuming you cod me at lmfao seriously though mods made you take off your co maybe because they were no longer valid but most likely because you made them up just like my lowball offer i can print screen out entire convo for reddit to see if you like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,pattern ago u r ak if u sell kato so u will sell u r ak ok dont fucking shit price plz price check
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i didnt tell you to sell it for any price i just said your price was shit your offer was from weeks ago in that space of time the ldlc price has dropped im not even mad look at you writing me an essay every time i write you you must love me baby hahaha thanks for making my day nothing better than to wind up an aggressive angry rude person
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nobody buy this ak if some guys buy he is world best idiot

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nice ak but fucking hell price have an downvote guys d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,seriously lmfao thats the best you gotthere are two for sale at a very close price and they havent sold for weeks katowice stickers dont have a lot of listings so of course the next few will be highballers i guess some people dont like to actually sell anything just like you so you can use other platforms to get the same sticker at the same price in keyscash out sites u know not everyone only can use reddit or opskins i have never heard of anyone that doesnt accept taking the listed price on opskins as the set price of the item in cashout value keeping in mind that the ldlc has not sold for a long time i would say that even is generous its ok though u can keep advertising on redditput on opskins everyday like u have for the past weeks month and have it not sell your choice but i just find your stupidity and arrogance halerious so dont mind me ill just make sure i say hi everytime

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,personally ive traded up twice from inventory to over first time as i was just starting the second time to challenge myself to do it faster and find shortcuts both of those attempts were primarily focused on item trading on lounge simply look up the httpscsgosteamanalystcom value for current item and then look for items that are more expensive on avg this is indeed slower than key trading but to do key trading you need to learn the market first get used to tools like the steam market sa generally only reliable for items under opskins and csgo exchange once you learn the lay of the lands feel free to explore key trading niche markets etc

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,acceptedupvote pls if u can so
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you want the whole fucking story since it seems you are interested dignitas holo went for less than k each the seller had his trade for weeks ive added him and asked his price he told me he had it pricechecked for me offering anything there and he would accept it i tried he asked for more in the end we had a nice chat i paid keys because he asked for more since that would give him enough money to cashout for his camera he wanted to buy for his studies so it would help him out i gladly paid more because of the conversation and we agreed to the fucking bo i took the risk because nobody knows what would happen with the sticker hype it could plummet he told me he had it for a long time and this was already nice profit for him and dignitas holo is one of my favorite stickers i was looking for one with or stickers ever since my inventory was just keys but i could never commit to it now i did it risked it the hype just went on and now went past it means i made the right choice to buy it again his post was there for some time and he could have asked for more or less or not sell it the sticker rise and a week later or so he suddenly tells me im scum and deletes me as if i sharked him we agreed and did a deal he was happy i was happy i never tell what i bought something for because even if the item is worth its price people somehow dont want to buy something if they know this price but you come here and shit on my post as if i sharked the item well now its public yes if it sells im profiting but i got it on an honest trade with the risks involved so dont give me shit and spread negativity on my trades

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,mmmkay pimp juice well have a nice day
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hahaha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,tags have to be relevant to your post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,opskins key price is not there are two different markets opskins key and steam market and therefire reddit price key dont mix it up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,no offense dude but i come across traders like you every day that cant get their head around the fact that opskins and similar sites are not the place to get the true value or a skin from i have people adding me saying but on opskins your skin is blah blah its the most frustrating thing i have to deal with as a trader loads of people think that because its x price on opskins then thats its price written in stone your applying steam key prices to some skin selling websites prices when that website has its own key price this has been pointed out to you by a number of people on this thread yet its gone completely over your head as your reply with i was converting using the usual key price afaik because that would be how i sold it if i bought one no dude if you bought a key from that site it would cost you you are completely ignoring the fact this is a third party site and everything there is cheaper if steam didnt have a max value on the market you would find the same karambit fades going for much more on steam tldr op skins is not the place to value items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,stoptheloungers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,kara its sa
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,have links to those selling it for cheaper
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it seems that people are just losing interest in tradinglikeyou see lots of people cashing out atm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,in fn for just
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,run fest men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,daamn i didnt notice that i guess its too late to apply
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,people are scared from the gambling many have cashed out and are waiting this is the definition of a market recession it will be interesting to see what happens in the near future my guess is the traders like me who just cant keep away from trading will all be back in the next month or two when things settle down gamblers will be gone forever though im guessing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,would you do keys and a fac new awp graphite
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yup god forbid you ask what you did wrong too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why didnt you just use bitskins or opskins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,should of used opskins or bitskins whatever you do dont lie it will only make the situation worse
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,a lot of people i know have stopped trading since the prices died cancer mods
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,youre literally asking to get scammed just use opskins i dont see the struggle i dont get why people still try to cash out with trusted buyers when they can have zero risk with a small commission
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,downvoted cuz ur
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ive got scammed in the same way for paypal dont care about that becouse they are helping only buyers about your negative balance you need to refund it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i feel bad for you but use next time opskins or bitskins then you are safe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,let me know once you put up a sale post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why do people still feel inclined to sell to users straight via paypal its like asking to get scammed especially since safe websites like opskins exist also never put in that much irl money to virtual skins jesus
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,mods censor any mentions of safe ways for people to sell their skins and a user gets scammed because hes never heard of these sites
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,paypal give zero shits about the seller and will take the buyers side time after time after time which is fuckin awesome if youre like an ebay seller or some shit but also means youre asking to get scammed if you just sell to random people with no middleman also the fact that the other guys are willing to go first when you have no trading reputation should send up massive red flags legit traders will always ask you to go first if they have more rep than you although on the flipside oftentimes people who ask you to go first can be scammers too here are some tips for the future if you ever get back in trading only do direct pp trades if the other person has a lot and i mean a lot of cashrep or is a recognized community figure ie rofl mcskillet for trades with some random fuck who doesnt meet the above criteria insist on a verified middleman from steamrep or no trade keep in mind also that they will likely try to impersonate a middleman after you say that so crosscheck the verified middlemans links with the person that the other guy is claiming to be the middleman honestly though just sell on opskins yes they take a small commission and yes youll be selling for a bit less but its worth peace of mind that youre getting money at the end of the day
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im from sg too cash out successfully over add me if you need to cash out anymore items

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hi i started a long time ago with euros now im on about using mainly csgosell and csmoney lately as well i want to get into key trading and i dont know how i should start any advice d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,whats a good percentage to quick sell of analyst and whats a good one to buy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what was your inventory value when you started trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the harsh truth is that when everybody is a good trader then nobody really is for some to profit others have to lose profit the only real injections into the market are unboxings nowadays more people are just after profit and therefore it has been much more difficult to make profit i think its great that youre sharing some of your experience though but there isnt really a magic cure for being a great trader in my opinion thanks for helping out though

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,possibilities sih after being bought out by a literal scam site somehow compromises its users and sells the skins on overpoweredsite or some other third party marketplace theyre aligned with still doesnt explain how they were able to bypass mobile but we during some kind of confirmation email from any party site a worm or trojan got into your friends phone and allowed offsite control of his confirmations short list of things you can do factory reset the phone with the guard still on and use the rec code to get you the trade ban so nothing else can be stolen factory reset any and all devices your friend used to login to steam in the past few months id reccomend putting in a steam support ticket even though steam isnt gonna do anything it logs a complaint and a record of this happening with their system of my friends had the same thing happen their accounts were hijacked and skins were stolen both skins oddly enough
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ak blue gem mw ss for your dlore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,me neither and if it is true why sell it for instead of like or even i cant imagine such a complicated hacking effort costing less than a hamburger of course were in no position to speculate if it is true or not but perhaps his friend has a problem with alcohol resulting in a memory loss of the past evening making up this idea to fill the void and shift the blame of the unknown all in all i wonder how he got it back if the bot was offline tho did he request a refund asap was the buyer stolen from then after all he did pay the bucks with the only reason he didnt get it yet being a crash so many questions so little answers

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why doesnt rofl share the idea himself
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i can answer to this question some time ago guy added me randomly on steam and he told me that he found me on cs go longuei do not have account on longue and he wants to overpay for my items and i can choose one of his items anyway i will copy paste everything here never tell your password to anyone you dont know me hey you dont know me bro you dont know me you there you dont know me butterfly knife crimson web icarus fell this you dont know me up for a trade biszek hi you dont know me hello there that bro up for trade biszek um you dont know me yes biszek i never really did trade anything on steam to be honest you dont know me oh well you dont know me want to trade now or something you dont know me there you dont know me can check and tell me what you may like for your stuffs biszek i can folllow up process that is not complicated i am sure of it but why do you want to trade you dont know me what do you mean biszek i mean you did add me from nowhere just like that and i am confused a bit you dont know me oh you dont know me i found you on lounge you dont know me and friends also you dont know me well im willing to overpay you dont know me any intrest on my stuffs maybe you dont know me any dream knives you dont know me or something biszek it says your profile is private you dont know me min you dont know me ok done you dont know me biszek still this profile is provate with some japanese or chinese name you dont know me wait you dont know me orry you dont know me wrong link you dont know me let me fix it biszek you dont know me ya sorry wait you dont know me min el chapo ok its fixed biszek also i do not have any dream knifes or anything if i want something ill just buy it like for example i would buy awp dragon lore if it was on steam as i am not using party website for trade and what not so as i stated above if you would have dragon lore and willing to trade then yeah i would choose that item but it is quite rare to get it and it is overpriced i believe el chapo done el chapo can see it now el chapo i have dlores atm el chapo also el chapo swa it el chapo saw it biszek who are you that is crazy amount of items you got over there el chapo uhm i bet alot el chapo also administrator at csgo el chapo why biszek well right now i am much more confused than before why you are willing to trade my two items for one of your when that single one of yours if worth much more than those two el chapo i see el chapo i dont know about me el chapo but i really like to over pay my clients in trades el chapo to help em out like that el chapo well its your call el chapo i respect your decision el chapo if you dont wanna trade biszek do send me offer for dragon lore then el chapo for your knife el chapo and biszek you just stated that you are willing to overpay so yeah i guess el chapo yup relax el chapo wait el chapo moment el chapo can i have your trade url please biszek you can just click on that little dingle on my profile and offer trade i do not have trade url i never used that thing el chapo oh el chapo ok el chapo ya el chapo btw you do have readed my trading guidelines below in my profile i guess biszek um no el chapo can read it if you dont mind el chapo you there budd el chapo you there biszek well friends are telling me that you are scammer in trainning taken fact that you use two account with false information is much more clear for that case also i do not have longue account or whatever was it never used it and apparently you are going to send me link to party website that you use for stealing others items and as i stated above i do not use party websited to get stuff for csgo i am taking safe route always if you are legit trade and willing to overpay i guess you will add me from other account ending in not without and send me offer for those two items if i get blocked i guess ill do share it on reddit and other websites as well as on csgo support for scaming el chapo what his trading guidelines well im just a person a trader who would highly recommend a safe trade i tend by lending our trades via steamworksdeveloper we arent doing middlemaning for a very well supervised trades whybecause im really aware of those items that are from stolenscammed or casino items that are really unsafe items his other accounts httpsteamcommunitycomiddot httpsteamcommunitycomiddot httpsteamcommunitycomiddot some screens in case he blocked his profile

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hahaha omg im dying so funny
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,reported that its on opskins its not allowed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,reported for flaming its not allowed have you not read the rules
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,paypal is rampant with scammers just as much as bitcoin but what they do is buy goods with stolen accounts or cc numbers and the charges get reversed later on and you are out the items and the money no such risk exists in bitcoin if you wait minutes for the confirmation credit cards take days to settle which at any time in that period they can be reversed bitcoins reverse window is approx minutes before the transaction is permanent with appropriate transaction fee one notable exception scammers will use too low of fee on the transaction so it wont confirm on purpose which gives them extra time to resubmit a second transaction with a higher fee to steal the funds
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah probably a ruski check his last pot and cringe on the reply he made on my comment xd

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i seriously must not say that i have dragon lore on the site site i must not name not even in that context like i didnt say go buy it but to prevent people asking me why its not in my inventory and sorry if thats so wont happen again

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,rip csgo and most importantly rip harambe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,everyone who thought this wouldnt happen was delusional i dont expect too much of a pricedrop since this was widely expected in the community of high volume traders anyways and the normal trader who just has of each item wont have too much of an impact you guys take any news regarding csgo items now with the same impact that the saleoff of gambling sites had those sites were selling millions of items after the announcement which caused the immense price drop if you havnt noticed were already back to an incline just check sale graphs volume prices on the scm common cash sites etc my cents sorry copy pasta from the other thread
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,stop panic guys wtf is wrong whit you x all is gonna be fine dont panic that much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ya it is unless you have a mental disability
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,meh its not even about lounge anymore valve are killing the game themselves and this is happening exactly as turner signed a tv deal gonna flop as bad as the source one now because people will have no interest in watching pros play a shitty game where the new spray mechanics are about as predictable as the location a cow picks to eat grass at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,let us now panic based on facts we already knew are going to happen around a month ago
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,great job now the cs economy is more than f up huehue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can confirm was behind him all the time xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ur name will soon be roadtobluegemcollection since prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,opskins shouldnt be mentioned here hmm a safe fast method for people to cash out and a huge player in the trading industry without sites like opskins and bitskins trading wouldnt be half the size it is you do realise this honestly the fact you guys ban even the mention of opskins makes no sense your just allowing more and more amateur traders to get scammed and not to be aware of the most reliable ways to cash out you will say that opskins is banned because they make profit off people etc however firstly they should make a profit they offer a fast professional and safe service cashing out with high rep traders etc is the exact same way because they are also making profit obviously otherwise why the hell would they buy the items or keys honestly this sub needs to sort there stuff out they are crippling trading in general from not allowing good information to your audience
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,please delete this post because post like this starting panic selling and all that shit

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,how does that affect high tier skins though wasnt the max bet value around usd anyway it used to be fun and all but its not like its guaranteed to have some major influence in the higher tier unlike gambling websites i know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the only people whose gonna get benefited is opskins if lounge closes kids will run and buy from there they wont be much left to trade only if opskin close and valve issues one more thing that virtual items cannot be exchanged for real cash then all of this bullshit will make some sense and how come csgofast still operating
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hi im trading an whiteout fn if you are interested add me in steam i have it atm on opskins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it was not an act of authority as nhilya would like everyone to believe i dont want anyone to believe anything bro its just how i feel when a well thought out post of me gets removed among all the shitposts because price speculations arent allowed here since a while eventho this entire news is aimed towards our items and our prices youre kind of dictating this whole scenario tho by removing our right of free discussion which is technically an act of authority but i get your point this sub has gotten too big to have the awesome and logical discussions that wev had a year or so ago on here kind of sad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the fact that this needed to be psad makes me very sad

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they are going to crash again its not a smart investment at all the demand for them comes from the idea that they will rise as fast as before thats just an artificial demand do you ever think anyone would want to pay keys per sticker to use at a weapon and then lose most of the value of the sticker because its applied of course there will be some rich guy applying of them to a dragon lore but i mean the market in general the smartest investors in this hype train is those who buy in early and just dump them all before they crash just a disclaimer im not good with economics at all honestly really shitty but i am sure that crown foil is a terrible investment unless youre doing a scummy pump and dump early
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah ik didnt realize that you couldnt even ask to add you when they got a price my bad

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ive talked to some people whore concered about the same issues people told me the following everybody argues that cause gambling leaving the csgo scene the csgo scene will decrease as a consequence the demand of skins will decrease too whereas supply is going to rise as everyone whos exiting is trying to sell their skins huge gap between supply and demand prices we drop thats how it is at the moment but if it comes to high tear items its kind of a different story bc its not that affected by the entire thing you wont go on a gambling site and put your sapphire dlore in there but those guys who usually buy high tier items know that if the same item drops hard in price people will be forced to lower their bos too and they know that the demand of such unique items is low anyway they freeze their own demand although its still there to just see the lowballers lowball each other down theyre just waiting because they know they can and this is the reason why rofl hasnt been sold yet he said on stream that he wants to sell it for around now hes joining the downhill trip and it wont change anything those guys who really want to have such a thing are just going to keep on waiting but tbh i dont want to be part of this game

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lots of this is textbook advice as in if everything goes as it should unfortunately thats not how it is to counter some of your points never do a trade without profit again this is basic but also the most important rule if you wanna win in the long term i do lots of trades without profit sometimes i even lose a couple keys why i end up with fewer and easier to sell items which makes it worth it since i spend less time liquidating dont be afraid of rare items yeah i know some of you would say dammit that item was shit and bla bla but in all the time i have been trading the items i have made most profit on are bayo bp ak ch kara tiger stat hunts night fn and so on i have never been stuck with an item but this ofcause requires that you are a good buyer you need to find a person who just wanna get rid of it how do you find them you ask its easy go on lounge search for fn hunt night for instant click on all untill you find a guy posting like trades with the same item then you know he really wanna get rid of ito if you dont know what youre doing and lets be real if youre looking at a guide on how to trade you dont then absolutely avoid all rare items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,same shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,remove opskins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,and op
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,added
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,shut up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well take a look at the results mins since i opened the post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im trading with bots of certain sites that i cant name here ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,one guy sellin his cheaper
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,salty mods are always a joke its a pc and they claim i am using world ranking lists i simply enumerated facts just like every other pc or thread on this website another reason why this sub is such a joke
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,will repost my previous comment from last thread lots of this is textbook advice as in if everything goes as it should unfortunately thats not always how it is to counter some of your points never do a trade without profit again this is basic but also the most important rule if you wanna win in the long term i do lots of trades without profit sometimes i even lose a couple keys why i end up with fewer and easier to sell items which makes it worth it since i spend less time liquidating dont be afraid of rare items yeah i know some of you would say dammit that item was shit and bla bla but in all the time i have been trading the items i have made most profit on are bayo bp ak ch kara tiger stat hunts night fn and so on i have never been stuck with an item but this ofcause requires that you are a good buyer you need to find a person who just wanna get rid of it how do you find them you ask its easy go on lounge search for fn hunt night for instant click on all untill you find a guy posting like trades with the same item then you know he really wanna get rid of ito if you dont know what youre doing and lets be real if youre looking at a guide on how to trade you dont then absolutely avoid all rare items pay for patterns yeah i know this sounds stupid why shouldnt i just say i dont care about patterns stickers and so on well we all heard that and when that strategi is used the outcome is often instant delete and maybe even a block so dont turn it around and tell the guy with the item hey dude i saw your slaughter and i really like the pattern so im willing to offer you over market what do you say to xx you will be surprised about the answer often they have a lot more respect for you and you will more often end up getting the deal cheap this is important because when you then trade on you will often have a lot more profit because of the pattern and the fact that there is a lot of guys out there who want your item never pay for patterns excluding case hardened always charge for patterns free profit accept fast when you see an offer that just looks good do not hesitate accept instant ofc make sure its the right items right proces and so on so again the more prepared you are the more likely you are to not make mistakes some of the best deals i have got has been on quick accept i have also lost a deal because i just wanted to check reddit another time or opskins and so on and when comming back to the trade the trade was gone and daum that hurts everytime very bad advice rather lose on potential key profit than lose keys because you rushed a trade take your time if the offer is gone by the time you decide its a good one then thats a shame once youre experienced you can pretty much instantly spot a good offer and do these fast accepts to get it going buy autobumps on louunge its worth every penny the last year i havent sent offer out and be clever when setting up the trades if you have a rare item then search for rare items example you have a hunt night who could be the buyer people with bfk night bluesteel guys and so on this is not easy but takes a bit of practice just makes sure your posts on lounge is not your items and searching for any offers that will not work i guarantee you thato you can get these for free with loungedestroyer chrome extension

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,unoonoocsgo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,for me the dumb trader is one who you send an offer to literally a minute after they post and they dont accept for hoursonly to wake up and find out their items now unavailable for trade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ive had people add me saying they have liquid items for my skins then proceeded to give me cent guns with team liquid stickers on them it was amazing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hello usolarseal your post has been removed because titles with unnecessary attention grabbers or inaccurate information are not permitted this includes but is not limited to httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikiclickbait excessive use of capital letters symbols emojis name tag on the item search tags memes and stories trade posts with the exception of stores are required to include their buyout in their title if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,some little kid price checker told me my is worth keys above market so i went with it and asked him how much hed give me and he sent me the offer for like keys or so because he was feeling generous and followed me around server to server and commented on my profile numerous times reminding me that he had offered me dddd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this bloke added me looking to trade for my bayo sapphire offered me items with their descriptions and i thought this is a bit low i roughly knew the prices so i started trawling through reddit to get a more accurate price for the patterns and such and literally came upon the dudes store and he was still low by about so i told him and then he did a full from saying he was roughly meeting my bo to my sapphire was worth less and he started going on about how the price of sapphires and rubys are dropping and so forth and how i didnt have a co i did and sent him a screen link started saying how it was low even though it was still more than what he was offering then he tried to go back to saying his prices were higher and how he dropped his prices so that they would sell or some other bullshit anyway long story long this went on for about another and he still couldnt get through his head that his offer was low after a while i just gave up trying to put it in a way he would understand and just unfriended him
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,me anytime i try to debate with someone on using opskins as a way to find an items value
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,guy wanted to sell me knight for keys last major xp and he argued me that is price of it even tho i showed him shitton of reddit posts etc

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ak redlines for both
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,high risk high reward boiis
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just curious on the reasoning though like did a deal fall through and since you guys arent getting paid its not allowed to be mentioned its weird as fuck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,my ak tier blue gem blue top
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the market will die if there is possibility to cash out skins to real world any more its not sure if opskins etc will stay up personally i think its very unlikely theyll shut down anyways the possibility is technically there so everyone is panicking and quickselling their butts and grandmas which crashes the market even more of course imo we can do without betting sites but we cant do without an option to cash out to paypal or bitcoin if its certain opskins and such stay up the market should recover on top of that it looks like gambling sites are just finding ways to comply with valves terms of service instead of shutting down csgostrong csgocrash lounge
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,giveaway sth for this huge win plox

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ive also been called out by stroeckx on a clickbait title although my once was more justified i agree if a really bs asiimov can be called a blackiimov then blackbeast should be allowed if description of patternwear is not allowed then shouldnt clean corner black pealsapphireruby also be disallowed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it shoul not be clickbait since is the name of the high floats hyper beasts just like the asiimovs it the same logic ive sold tons of blackbeasts and ive always put blackbeast in the title and i never got problems

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ok here goes the real pc you should be glad to have sold it for a few more keys than you bought it for the only real gold pattern and sell for and even these take a long time to sell if they even get sold at that price they go for more realistically judging from your screenshots this is far from a gold pattern and more towards the overly common slightly less purple shit overall so a gold ak pattern there are a ton of these on the market at anytime its screenshotted in full sunlight which makes it so you hardly can see its mostly silver gold and thats before the market went down a ton so these days i would expect to pay around for one its still a special pattern that doesnt come around often therefore holds its value better

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,go away u suck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,idk thats really stupid to me it should be what the community wants the subreddit is for what the community wants after all but lately over the past year or so tons of rules have been implemented that nobody approves of or wants at least let the community have at least a tiny say in the matter like jesus christ straight up hitlers up in here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,holy shit thats fucked fuck the mods of this sub jesus christ freemetjm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wow this sub is for the best of the community not some power trip the mods want metjm is useful and free might as well ban csgolounge and all mentions of it since they have ads eh wait a fucking ad on the subreddit better ban raww rretrogaming rgaming and every other subreddit that runs ads might as well ask them to merge with rgotrademen since the ads are on this sub and we cant have that at least run a poll or something theres like a dozen mods here why tf do their voices outweigh that of actual users of the sub metjm and all the things that come along with it straight up banning metjm does more harm than good this sub is seriously cancerous
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so its ok for exchange to have ads because you guys make money off of it lol fuck this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,w
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah i just read it the mods on this forum are braindead i swear trying to force him to change his name to the name of their subreddit like you tards didnt do shit for his site really think hes going to name it after you they host ads on this subreddit right on the sidebar brainless
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so why do the sites you are partnered with advertise for in addition to the same shitty gambling sites
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i know its not transactions but im willing to go first and all i understand if you dont want to sell to me though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,metjm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,k bye
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,rmetjmtrade ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,garbage ass rule regarding linking to metjm youre gonna see one less person off this sub as soon as i get rid of my high tier shit this sub is turning in to complete garbage of traders dont sit in front of their pc all day like you mods banning the use of directly linking metjm screens is unnecessarily annoying for people that dont get to take screens for everything they have because we dont sit our fat asses in front of a pc we do post trades from mobile phones and you disallowing metjm linking is just completely ignorant ruining this fucking sub day by day
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,neat
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lucky if you get
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,expoooooooooosed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,mods went and thought they could bully metjm into advertising rgotrade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dicks out for metjm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,please click on the pc thread learn that there are less than floats in the world and please come back here telling us all that this is not worth let alone a very good price of
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i voted dissatisfied the mods just ban and censor everything they live in some delusional universe where theyre doing right by the community you need some lateral thinkers who can formulate the right approach to a problem not just ban or censor it tldr get some intelligent mods ban
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,no one cares
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,rmetjmtrade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,good
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,because you have no nuts and dont know how floats work
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,umetjmtrade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,go to the site we cant mention search hydroponic float lowhigh end of proof your turn
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,good all of them need to step down after the disaster that took place go and delete this sub when you are going out the door
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can we ban the use of straw poll or at least let them rename it to gotradepolls theyre profiting of our user base
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,we really do try to manage this sub with you guys in mind ahahaha what a fucking joke
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dumb asses whining about the metjm shit now is that the way the leader should speak really people are worried about something and you call that a shit just wow man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i posted a poll asking whether or not the mods should resign it was in less than minutes it was removed for not being realistic i hope that answers your question
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,theres always been corruption with the mods just power hungry what they dont understand is trading in general is going downhill atm and no one knows when it will stop all they are doing is adding fuel to a fire
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,kys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah mods are on point lol stop whining you retarded ppl who mean nothing to this sub this sub would be nothing without these intelligent mods to keep you dumb asses under control oh wait the users of the sub are more important then mods cause with out the users the mods have zero power and a empty sub hmmmmmmmmmmm modlogic
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,metjm was offered an ultimatum to offer his services on behalf of rcsgotrade and would be forced to remove all identity of his own hard work do you truly think thats remotely acceptable nobody asked csgoexchange to make itself represents this subreddit in anyway you clearly dont care for metjm or the community for that matter aside from extortion and harassing valuable service providers for your own benefit its not even that hard to replicate his service pretty low if you ask me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,these dumb asses are who you should be supporting you are the problem of this sub fix yourselves not the stupid rulessubscribers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the mods are butthurt because they cant have a donate me plzz button on this site but metjm does
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,holy shit what is wrong with you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,unnecessary behaviour lmao more like unnecessary changes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,disgustingly greedy in how to kys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,by good comments you mean that comments that dont show how stupid mods are have you seen any mod conversations or mod only thread here its all memes and useless shit how about ban and go fuck yourself
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just let metjm do its thing stop being a cunt youll literally kill this subreddit if you turn into a nazi
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i feel kinda bad for rofl guy he invested few thousand dollars and then you get days ban soomeones job here is trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°╯╲卐卐卐卐 dont mind me just taking my mods for a walk
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,edit just because some people dont realise whar i mean by my first sentence im talking about the people coming here whining about metjm and generally showing rude and unnecessary behaviour in this thread you mean like you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so when did u buy imgur or they also rejected your gay offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you dont have a problem with any other sites youre partnered with having ads and promoting themselves why single out metjm alone and not exchange or csgozone
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,weve lost two great mods mrjiggles so he stepped down still see him in the mod list thanks for clearing all this mess up shub da whub good call on that one for sure enjoy your holidays
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,keys max and i send you a very good offer but if you want more gl with the prices these days
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,thank you for the reply
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im new nazi now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i think for your honesty and your dedication for this sub and spending dollars for internet shows that you really care i like that and i think hopefully anyone else does too but in this particular case i unterstand your point of view with the ad thing but metjm still put a shit ton of work in his project and it is still free an awesome for everyone and you have to keep in mind that hes a student and those do not have time for something like that so i understand his decision to search for a sponsor although i dont like the redirecting massive banners as well and in the end youd have to ban exchange then too cause they have a paid service and ads as well so i think that a regulated way of banning metjim is the right path to go
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,tbh i think most of the mods on this sub were thinking they were the fucking police need to learn to chill out let things pass the greedy attitude towards metjm is ridiculous
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i wonder why
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,globaloffensivetradetools thats like north korea going to south korea and threatening to nuke them unless they call themselves south korea you and who ever else made this decision should have to step down from being mods here i will stop using the sub until ushubbler and whoever else was a part of the decision steps down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,word from a mod who keeps us from spamming feelsbadman
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the fact that there was a vote and presumably more than half of the mod team thought the actions that were going to take place against metjm were ok is pretty disgusting
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,will pay you for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,llelelelellelel thats why i left this piece of shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,its still disgusting that you are banning talking about metjms service he is a great guy that cares about the community and you are encouraging not to support his work i now see why metjms left this sub because if someone is using my work but at the same time discouraging it i would be mad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,oooooooooh shiiit shots fiiired mah nigga take my upvotte
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,probably the same thing tried to partner with them and got told to shove the fuck off which is well deserved i might add gotrade lives because its on reddit not because of any other reason if someone else who could offer an improved effort over lounge lel had stepped up and gained momentum before them wed be trading on that sub instead how else have so many trade servers gotten a following literally some reasonable admins being around is all you needed at first the admins havent quite figured that part out yet they still think this popularity is all because of them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just kill yourself
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah probably a little easier for a streamer to eat less and lose weight because their fat ass doesnt move anyways than a normal human who wastes energy with jobs and lives any normal day in day out worker would become exhausted starving themselves of calories because they move around i lost pounds from january on to may eating healthy lower caloriefat foods in may i started working out and upped my calories and im down pounds im and pounds on january of this year i know i wasnt overweight when i began working out but calorie deficit diets dont work well in practice

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,trade posts are required to have a realistic and specific buyout for every item up for trade httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,that aint flaming i was just asking if he is the graduate of csgolounge
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,cuz thats what a lounger would do a lounger is the only person in the trading community who would ask the other party to go first even tho his rep is shit or lower if your cashrep is lower than him then he wont go first cuz you aint trusted enough and no matter how big the facebook community is makes no difference hope you understand
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,my history i like how you guys categorized having an opinion under the term flaming very nice im out of this thread adios
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hmm my best guess is that there in trade bots maybe selling keys and buying one off the market or csmoney has good rates for even better put it in your name and get extra
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,get a better topic
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wouldnt of rly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,gj mods you fucked upthe nobile view
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,for a falchion stained mw

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item you buy trade or sell here examples keys for my knife karambit fade for keys bayonet forest ddpat mw for bayonet boreal forest ft make sure that you have not stated that you will pay up to you have stated a bo for all your items you have specified a condition for every item you are tradingtrading for if you are trading for specific floats you have specified how much you will pay for different floats if you want a range of items eg any key knives you have listed some example knives and how much you will pay uiteirpl please httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules before you do anything else on the rglobaloffensivetrade subreddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,ill give you keys in items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,interesting idea that can help others understand ch aks better my friend is interested in trading one that has all top segments blue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,meh theres only a few patterns with significant value anyways and people have mostly memorized their indices and kinda and cant see this being anywhere near worth the effort especially since its almost unsearchable and doesnt fit in the title of a post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this requires the entire trading community to accept an arbitrary standard when everyone besides this sub woohoo antiquated rules but weve developed organic workarounds has been using the same few terms and rankings for what three years now not gonna happen and no ones gonna use it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,again requiring people to adopt a standard thats totally arbitrary and that you basically pulled out of your ass its not going to happen especially if your idea is for traders to willfully link a site that provides alternatives which achieves absolutely nothing beyond making buyers less likely to buy their skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i have an fully grey ak ch with two dots of blaze pattern really nice ak go fest mon people trying to oversell their shit i am getting sick of stuff like this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,some guy tried to make me do this tldr i made him trade me one of his skins to prove me that he is not going to scam me irony
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i am currently selling keys for any steam items worth i need to have a solid item that sells so i can buy a few steam games
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im not confident enough in my statements to have them publicly displayed without having to open a collapsed comment marked
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,im not here to be productive to what youre acompishing im here to point out that youre acompishing nothing of value this isnt your board and you dont get to decide what goes on it sorry to break it to you stupid fucking arguement fitting for a stupid fucking thread eh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,my bad i deserve a ban

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well you can however see influences from the outside that could influence skin value like the betting scandal or maybe the new operationcaseknife so people could always ask also saw something about china getting cs go which might influence it aswell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,we contacted metjm and offered what we consider to be a more then fair offer of removing his logo and name from the screenshot and renaming it to globaloffensivetrade the reason we asked this was because metjm would be working under us metjm declained the offer and they wanted to ban his services in this sub

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,tradebotcsgodouble
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i got a also super clean u can get it for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,anyone can craft a skin with this fv in fact a higher tier skin u are clueless if you think this is worth keys regardless of the fact another cant be crafted this is a terrible skin on a bad weapon anyway maybe to someone who has no idea how fv works and just wants to buy it especially considering an officer has now pcd it at keys he can get but thats just the same as selling any worthless skin to someone for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,keys for my tiger tooth fn float awesome float and looks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,smells like scam
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,dont believe so sounds like he got scammed pretty hard by this site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i guess the site wasnt doing well and they just ran with the lores so he is pretty much fucked
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,let me guess a guy just added him on steam and told him that his an administrator of csgostakes and he can let him make profit if they it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,isnt this the site steel used to use on site al the time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,well as you said all details on their twitter page steam group and website have all been removed and the site owner now has a private profile it sadly smells as if the decided to take all and run
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lots of dragon lores how much are we talking about here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hastn the sitr been closed a month ago i remember when i wanted to gamble there but they wrote on their site that they closed and everyone shpuld withdraw their items from the sites inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,nothing your mate can do besides trying to flip his remaining inv for intelligence and never go to dodgy gambling pages
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,pretty sure the site was a fraud tbh the odds were always skewed and the deposit system was really fucking weird dazed kept using it and he was acting as though he was losing a lot of skins when he was clearly given by the site to use so yeah low chance your friend is going to get those lores back
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,any day any of these unregistered site could run off with anyones money and no one can do anything blows my mind that all it takes to run a scam on a big level is to just hire some streamers to promote your site these streamers will promote anything for skrilla by the way then just run away when you feel like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,you cannot deny the fact that this float is never going to happen with this skin again this is what has proven to me you are simply not worth replying to simple statistics tells us that as long as people are still playing csgo this float will occur an infinite number more of possible times there will only ever be one so he can price it how he likes even though this is entirely flawed ill humour you yes he can price his market price skin at whatever he likes just as i can ask keys for an industrial grade skin that has a unique fv but that doesnt mean anyone will be foolish enough to pay that much for it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what the actual fuck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,floats are much easier to craft than correct so surely they should be market price dont you agree chances are you dont as you dont agree with anything the only reason that skins are more expensive is because there is a demand for them if someone wants to buy this then there is a demand for it and it can be sold at whatever price is agreed to plus you say that these skins can be crafted at any point is incorrect i assume that you are referring to skins these skins can be crafted once then they are never going to be crafted again therefore it is a matter of opinion what price they should be sold at be it market price or a ford fiesta turbo the price is an opinion and disagreeing with the opinion opens is simply opening up an argument dont stir up trouble for shits and gigs if you disagree with and pc be is an officer an owner or a simple scrub keep it to yourself or make a separate comment stating your price for it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,w t f
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,wow what the actual fuck iirc csgostakes was founded by the netcodesguides guys and their site was one of the sponsors of exibp dazeds stream this whole thing seems fishy as hell considering their coordination in the throw and their previous history sorry for the potential loss hope everything works out for you guys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,are we talking fn or bs or a range between like fn ft ish out of curiosity tbh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i could offer sand dunes with liquid holo stickers co me pls
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why would he deposit so many lores
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the site was saying we will shut the site permenantly please get your skins out of the site after month they shutted the site down so i think they can do nothing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,we need some kind of protection from this it can happen from any site including opskins ffs is there some lawyer out there that knows any kind of law from this kind of scam
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i dont believe you if you have any brain in your head you wouldnt deposit lores it also makes no sense to deposit a lore not on any site with a depositsystem because they are valued pretty low everywhere and thats why it would be gone anyways since somebody else would just withdraw it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,srsly it sounds weird but he has to go to the police and take a lawyer we are speaking about thousands of dollars here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i really want to believe you but i am doubting someone would desposit dlores on a site that has a warning about closing soon do you have any proof of the trade offer to the bot because this sounds like collaborated scam where owners and your friend are involved or smth hope it isnt
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,just advertisement
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,he gives u a free item so u visit his site just enjoy ur free item ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,theyre just advertising i got the same offer but i declined it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it is the same as other fishy websites like they have actually members on steam in the group and the page is actually scamming peoples items they just literary ban you after some time you cant connect anymore and your coins or balance is gone he probably can not do anything i tried the same at but without success
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,the site did say that they were shutting down and that it would be online for a few more weeks to let owners take their items back
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,unfortunately they did announce the website was closing before it went down and even left it up for a while for people to collect their items not much he can do if anything at all

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,cant wait to watch the price dip even more cause its not selling too bad i wont be interested then cause youre a dick
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i really think csgolounge needs to exist it helps lower tier teams and honestly its the only way female teams are somewhat relevant unless valve starts to care and make a site dedicated to all cs games in schedule this is rip
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah sure a game thats had a competitive esports scene for nearly years is going to completely die out by the end of this year because skin gambling is no longer a thing come on man grow a brain
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,they say using steam account for commercial use is not allowed that includes opskins too i am pretty sure
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,yeah i got that they also didnt include fanobet but the letter says that using steam account for commercial use is not allowed why this reason then just say we want to ban gambling sites opskins is using them for commercial use
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what about opskins and bitskins and csgoshop and exchanges market bots
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,opskins uses bots for commercial use opskins next
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,an upside of this is that opskins is not onthis list
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,it missed the worst of them all wwwcsgoscampotru
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,what about opskins actually if its just about using valve bots for commercial use opskins should be fucked too and all other skins for cash sites
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,why is nobody allowed to say the name of the overpowered site
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i would like a logo as profile pic d but im not a creative person my steam name is jucu and i just want a unique logo anything is fine d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,can offer you a valeria phoenix pin for it if youve any interest in pins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,does this mean cashing out sites could be potentially safe nothing like opskins or bitskins was mentioned and they operate with bots is it because they do no harm and operate at their own risk unlike steam bets
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i already removed your last post for incorrect proof of co and you make another one dont post it another time without updating the proof of co

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,sapphiresrubies were actually used by gamblers but not to gamble they used them to store the wealth since their account inventories were so limited they would trade shit knives for sapphireruby and then just hold that or use that to cash out on certain sites it was more convenient now that gambling died all the gamblers sold their hidden wealth and the reddit marketoverpowered site were flooded with them so they dropped down to what they were year ago before gambling was a thing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,emerald caused some of it but mostly because it was about time for them to come down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,theyve gone down because they were pointlessly hyped up like crown foils and the hype was perpetuated by all the gamblers who were able to buy them the flaunt their winnings but now gambling is gone people realised they were overpriced and noone was actually buying them so theyve gone down if you think i wouldnt know i have like of them so ive lost loads from it

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,awp fire serpent with cologne faze on handle
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i cashed out a month ago bought a new pc with the money said i was done with skins forever but now prices are so low and getting lower by the day im really tempted to buy back in the major concern for me however is if ops closes down due to valve pulling the use of their api for gambling sites now i know cash shops are not gambling sites but any sites using valves api to send and recieve skins for commercial purpose is against steam tos so if ops goes which lets face it at this stage no one knows for certain anything you invest in now and hope to sit on for profit later will just keep going down and youll never get a return on it valve is so vague though about this even in their statement they say to manage your inventory and trading accordingly this is very fucking concerning if valve decides to limit steam trading to the steam eco system only and the steam community market for selling then unless you just want nice play skins whats the fucking point of trading when you cant cash out so if your buying just for play skins go for it as for trading now hell no id even hold off on buying right now as im more than certian we will see even more significant drops in the coming days when valves cease and desist order use by date is up for gambling sites as they will again flood the market with even more skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,abyss w titan holo on the wood
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i would be tempted unfortunately i dont have keys atm only skins this whole market will hopefully recover when its clear that sites like opskins are not affected by the gambling ban they didnt get notices like the gambling sites to close down did they although they use a similar bot system

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,first day cases came out i unboxed a lightning strike fn after about cases opened first skin i ever opened was a dragon tattoo used it for a while and then traded it for an ak ch dont remember the pattern really my first ever drop was a negev anodized navy if i remember correctly which i decided to sell almost instantly because it was never going to go up in priceright guys first tradeup was just me trading up a mixture of skins i got off the market and opened up in my cases i was just going for the dark water from the first case and ended up getting another dragon tattoo instead unfortunately i dont really have any of my original skins left but i do prefer to play with the amazing skins from the earlier cases rather than the over complicated and ridiculous ones from the more recent cases personally i prefer valves skins by far and i believe that their designs have always been the best im not a huge fan of the cases that have come out since around mid or so but i understand why they do it but yeah there are my firsts when it comes to skins side note who else hates the new drop system i miss when they would give you a skin for each mission reward that was the main thing motivating me and it doesnt feel as fun anymore just my cents

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol never noticed d but still i have low prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,there was someone who did a very indepth guy on max blue and max pink for and karambits a couple months ago but iirc he had some issues with the mods and his posts kept getting removed dont remember exactly what had happened cause i didnt follow the guide id bookmarked it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,at least try to hide the fact its going straight to bot unless someone is retarded they are just going to go to csmoney and make the key profit them selves
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,this is my knife its a max blue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,whatahahaha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,alias its the only server that matters
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,biggest win bought kara cw fn for kara tt keys keys pure sold it for keys and cashed out
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,alias is micspam tgp is full of highballers dont know about any others
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,so after looking at all of the different tiers i gathered a few observations after comparing the metjms repeatedly there is a fair amount of variance among the playside blues that hasnt been accounted for there were some tier blues that had moreless blue than other tier we are missing a lot of patterns evidenced by the two i listed in this original post i do think there are more fake max blues than we think i definitely think that if the backside isnt a full blue with a blue tip it is completely ruled out of max blue i think the tiers have to be predicated upon a defined set of criteria on the playside fireice made their criteria i think a few of us on here have to analyze and create the criteria for max blue and i think we are still missing it comparing the to to all the metjms of the guide i would say is a fake max blue it has lower playside blue than almost every one of the guide examples yet it has a full blue bs hmmmme thinks a project is in order to get all the patterns and analyze the patterns to get a true max blue guide i think it will really impact for the better the values of max blues i think some are going to be worth much more and some will be more less it definitely will be good for the community though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,none
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,that karas previous bo was keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,cgnimo the best server but i am kind of biased since im a mod there tgp second favorite nice staff and people aliastbh i tend to try to avoid alias they have really great staff but too many people for their own good so it can get cancerous slayers just stay away from slayers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,lol alias server is good but the mods themselves are lowballers do pcs without knowing shit and then fucking offer on the item the reason some ppl dont have success is because they are used to treating ppl like trade bots and that is really not gonna work in voice chat esp when you forgot how to be a genuine person
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,gotrade trade server kappa
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,csmoney
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,haha thats funny
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,hope you get your money back dud happy new year
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,thats the anonymous leader send him your skins or suffer a ban
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,alias but all most mods just lowball and shark
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,alias trade server is the worst ive been to so far the mods have no clue what they pc wether its chs or katos they price it wrong everytime mostly lowball and then say they are intersted in it and pay more i got banned once because one of their year old admins typed the name of the guy to ban wrong and got me banned while i was midtrade the visitors or this server are the biggest highballer ive ever seen and insult you for offering items awp graphite for sa price they want to shark you and wont pay the price the item is worth thats what ive experienced and my friends say too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,removed,i got permed from alias for calling someone an idiot after they insulted me so fuck alias but on slayers at times its absolute fucking aids but sometimes its actually pretty decent and also cgn is dead

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the first number is the percent of blue zone is the most accurate form of check how much blue a histogram isnt good because of human error from all the people i have talked to in ch they use zone

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,coal and ice lel whats next true blue pearl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello ublujae your post has been removed because titles with unnecessary attention grabbers or inaccurate information are not permitted this includes but is not limited to httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikiclickbait excessive use of capital letters symbols emojis name tag on the item search tags memes and stories trade posts with the exception of stores are required to include their buyout in their title if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well the ps looks like fire and ice but black instead of red pattern looks very similar
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you look at the screen shot the pattern on ps looks extremely similar to fire and ice only difference is that it is black instead of red in the corner if fire and ice is a pattern name that is accepted why is coal and ice not its equally as descriptive of the knife its more of a description than clickbait
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fire and ice is accepted since thats how called is that pattern and everyone knows and uses this pattern name your pattern is max blue and thats how its known to everyone coal and ice is unnecessary naming already named pattern just to grab attention
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,added you to discuss fs co me at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so if somebody sends you an offer with a gut knife gamma doppler you would accept

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,are you more mad about your friend or that you lost a key skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my friend got vac banned with my knife on his account but he paid me back in cash
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whenever i see posts like this its always something along the lines of dont trust anyone ive done it many times before and i have always gotten my stuff back because my friends arent sacks of shit i have loaned a st kara fade to a friend who lived in another state and i got it back i just dont have shitty friends that would do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,stattrak condition stickers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,like the saying goes keep your enemies close your friends closer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im feeling like in elementary school
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,choose your friends well dude he must have made something that says he is an ass before and remember pretty sure he will buy you one back my friend gives me karambit ruby and sapphire and i never stole it from him not a you just gotta know the people so well before you lend them stuff gl bro and i know everyone is saying you dont have good friends and shit but i know that your point was just to make people more careful me myself got the point and i appreciate it man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have a friend i used to loan him my items whenever i would go over to his house with my laptop to game for nights upon nights hed always returned it nowadays i dont really do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty much this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah my buddies arent that bad other than that one but i just want people to be more careful than i was
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the skin doesnt matter to me i just feel mad because he did it not because im losing him as a friend or anything

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lent my friend my stat kara fade no probs getting it back
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yep never had a problem loaning my friends kara crimsons and crimsons back when they are key plus even to friends online not even from irl just depends on the so called friend i guess but whats upsetting is he sold a dollar skin probably for bucks on op skins

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah i know was just this one time i had loaned a skin and it ended badly so i wanted people to be aware that bad things can happen sometimes

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fuck chf usd pretty much i used to make profit from that rip my tactics
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmmm not quite sure if should be happy or sad in inventory happy sold nearly every every item i had happy money on bitskins and steammarket sad all my calculations based on sad all the fucked up prices now sad so i am happyhappysadsadsad time to start calculating in usd and eur only and not in keys anymore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,valve gaben brings shitty gloves case and changes key prices f you volvo gaben
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,usd aud rip
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,did key price change in uk
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,did it change in euro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dumb question but will this affect the price of skins and knives
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fucking key price to gg to all malaysians
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,here in nzd used to be
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,da fuq
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,got € steamwallet and was abou to buy keys to cash outthx valve
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wtf is this bullshit i have euros fucking hell anyone can confirm if they changed in italy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,usd i though it will always stay wtf
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont know about you guys the price hasnt changed at all for me in nzd still the nzd per key in game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,₺ rn it was ₺ before update
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nok
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fack y did they increase the price for myr
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,prices havent changed in the us just panic logged in after seeing this post and it hasnt changed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fuck nametags rased as well and i decided not to buy yesterday
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how will this affect trading i live in germany and luckily i bought with steam wallet days ago do i now have to calculate with € many traders will still trade with right before it stabelizes at €
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they just changed the exchange rate like they always do a key is still like it always was
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,didnt volvo said that usd price will never change
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,since brexit was first announced and then went through key prices in the uk have gone up twice im surrounded by racist morons which is bad enough but now its affecting my cs career time to march on parliament
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,luckie mei bought some keys last night and the prices wasnt changedi think this hole thing is for gaben to buy an airplane so keep buying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont forget your fancy new gloves
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it never changes is the base price for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this ones welcome
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i went from getting profit from each item to breaking even rip i need other items to trade now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,€ from steammarket in the early good days
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just yesterday traded keys to a knife € gone
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,were screwed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes from to euro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not really the change is very small
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks to trump and najib
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,feels bad man they were for a while in nz
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well at least now you can try and snipe some of the new gloves of the market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thx valve yes i believe valve real reason why is euro falling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well considering that italy is part of europe id say yes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it is idk what this guy is talking about
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but but they released glove case doesnt that mean they should get more money for their hard and dedicated work lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,price only changed for countries where their currency recently changed euro currently going down and atm € almost the same as at least pretty close to each other so valve fixed price and people like wtf valve want more money they just changed price so its remain equivalent for everyone and not cheaper for you and more expensive for somebody else
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what currency is that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how much did it change
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ignore what others say you always trade using usd as a base your item in usd and the key in usd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the price is now calculate with now no one with a half of a brain who knows the new price will calculate with the old price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but then trump came so now gaben wants to make csgo great again by getting more money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they didnt this guy messed up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,valve gives absolutely fucks about the community its all about the money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,with torches
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it was before lul
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol i have no idea how and why its cheaper
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its not really gone tho only youll have less keys so you could have had profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as long as the us prices didnt change the keyprice for items doesnt change as well
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ffs now i can probably get like keys less if i sold every item on the steam market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well its what mean every keys is one key less nots very small
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there still nzd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks for clarification
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but someone in the comments said the nzd price went when it didnt lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,turkish lira
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks for the answer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and pitchforks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its i guess because at current conversion rates is inr btw eur to inr is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hope so
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but the price that you will get for those keys will be the same as before
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well a key is still like it was yesterday and any other day
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,still in game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you seem not that long in csgo keys used to be each at the beginning and valve have changed it multiple times already always because of world currency changes so key price remain equivalent for everyone
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and fn driver gloves
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahhhhhhhhh good mathikitsgooglekappa
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well lets see how it evolveatm seems like that but who knows
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well as far as i can remember it was then then then and i guess its now i didnt even notice haha got keys weeks ago thought it was
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so wrong usd price still
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i never say opposite
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,flip doppler vanilla are both keys and look cool for their price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how about blue steelrust coat for ctt if you have enough keys or bayonet should at least fit the budget
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,flip doppler would be me xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,flip uf mw and gut doppler imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks but i dont wanna use a vanilla blue steel would be cool
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes i think blue steel is my favourite for ct still not that sure about t would like to have a kara but dunno the prices for a good kara rust
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also thought about that d but i think flip isnt a cool ct knife fits only for t imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im sure its out of your budget kara rusts are fairly costly compared to the other lower tier karas
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,kara rusts for atm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im the opposite i think i love myself a flip blue af on ct and a red knife or black lam on t side
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ok thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,havent thought about black laminate yet still too expensive i think
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hm found a kara rust for shouldnt i be able to get an blue steel with the keys i got left then aswell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,black lams are so under rated tbh i would just settle with a kar ablack lam mwft as i usually love good knife then knives x
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,try looking for one with higher float itll have more brown and looks way better imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have an doppler for a long time now and now i want knifes for some variety
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sounds fair i have knives too atm and its safe to say if u are going to get knives dont get the same type xd eg dont get karas flips get a flip etc

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,here is the range for bfk fades clearly not fullest httpprntscrcombmwppc
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keep your titles relevant to what is being soldwhat you want to buy unnecessary attention grabbers will just lead to the removal of your post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ah thanks for the heads up good looking out i can at least still call it a full fade heh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have no idea what im looking at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,got a ruby add me to discuss
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you have a lot of keys on this subreddit and look for big items you get upvotes regadless of shit prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so what would be an appropiate price in your opinion
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you know why they fix it now because
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wait what was wrong with it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah the notifications are working they fixed something that only takes minutes to fix but it took them weeks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what do i have to do if i followed the steps of the sih fix thread if i want it to work like before i miss the notification sound c
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i heard the sound again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i missed that notification sound way too much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,send me offer and well check lol edit notification works
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so is it confirmed safe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so everything is save i havent used it since the big thread
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,safe to use now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i wish they would fix the bigger bugs like sometimes only a single inventory page being accessible without refreshing and trade offer prices not loadingbeing out of whack
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea i saw that post yesterday and today bah sih is updated
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the notification for trade offers was missing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its a free addon if u want it done in minutes you should go and pay them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont know p maybe just delete all of it and add addon to chrome once again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,boooooooooom sound
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it was never opposite
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nope it took everything from me house car skins dog sex toys literally everything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it was never unsafe if you had mobile auth i dont get what the huge panic was
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you switch from their inv to your inv the page button fixes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as soon as the new extension comes i bet no one gonna use sih
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i already fixed it myself i just dont understand why they cant fix things in timely manner when the fix is right in front of their eyes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeh i thought that ty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well u never know since some jackpot site bought it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same make sure you attend the triple a meeting
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well it was sold and no one knew to who or what their intentions were for all we know they wanted it for some nefarious reason
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont mean in the trade offer window i mean when looking at your own inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im gonna i have no reason not to im not scared like you guys because there is no reason to if you have mobile authentication then theres no possible way to lose items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea for sure the new one looks way better
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,especially because such site as csgofast bought it they were safe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why would that effect anything if you have mobile auth they cant trade any of your items without you confirming
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but they would have to know if you had desktop auth and chrome extensions cant control your computer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the extension has a severe sandbox it cant access random files on your computer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,things they could only transfer coins on websites like csgofast csgowild double etc but not trades because chrome extensions cannot be used to remotely control computers make way more off their site that if they stole credits from some people no way they risk jeopardizing their reputation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,even desktop authentication doesnt matter because chrome extensions cant control the users computer only their chrome browser
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why is this downvoted damn dude the reference is amazing p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you look at the amount of credits people have on double they could make a small fortune stealing them if the purpose of buying it was to do something bad then they wouldnt care about their reputation yes they probly do quite make a bit on their site and the new owner is probably doing this for that but a lot of people left just to be safe espeicially considering there was no statemnt from the new owner or anything like that just the old one saying its sold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah and it was sold to a popular gambling site they wont ruin their reputation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,even if they somehow found a way to get peoples items it wouldnt be comparable to the profits from the website

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for co you should have the actual trade offer its self not just someone saying ill do this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then what should i do now no one sent me a trade offer for the huntsman
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,people have the chat ss all the time for co especially for bigger trades in this case its fine
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when they say their offer tell them to send it then use something like gyazo gif or something else to take a gif of the trade offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk maybe its just me but its super easy to just get a friend to say oh i can do max instead of them actually sending the offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when i wont go with their offers then why they will send me offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea i get it but people can offer whatever they want and if a co is way too high no one will want to offer on the item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,co means you took the offer if you dont take it dont say its a co
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then what is bo bro ive taken the offer as co thats why i put it as co
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks for repeating what i said co means you took the offer ive taken the offer as co
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,basically only take a co if you are willing to accept it if someone offers you something you wouldnt accept then dont list it as a co just say firm or not taking less than x
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay bro i dont want to argue with you thanks for your valuable advice

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,people are just unpredictable i dont think downvoting is as big of a deal as some people think it is everyone gets a post downvoted every now and then for seemingly no reason id love if people commented why they downvoted but theres no way to force people to do so
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,even my old max blue got downvoted like hell stil sold fr bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just want to know if people are still able to see heavily downvoted posts because i hear all this talk of that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea idk it seems like people use it too freely and there should be some sort of cooldown on downvotes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes people can still see but i think people are less likely to want to buy your item if its heavily downvoted because they think your price is bad when its not
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ill be honest i downvoted this post when i first saw it because fairly often this issue is addressed and it was even addressed by an officermod of this sub around a week ago and it is starting to get annoying seeing posts like these so i did downvote and move on for karmas sake ill leave it on neutral but people like me can easily get annoyed at stuff like this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea which brings me to my next point about a possible cooldown being implemented or something because the price is not bad on my bayo because ive received an offer keys under my bo

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,awp howi

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not literally howi
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,such specific much wow
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,much wowi
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,new operation drops fun time to get my shiny new op coin mass panic selling of inventories ensues causing prices to tank wait i only needed market recovers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,uh probably a dumb question but what are operations and why does it affect prices on knives also should i try to buy now or wait
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so at first everything might drop a bit because everyone needs those dollars secondly lets say you want to buy a medusa its always been dropped in the gods and monsters collection which can only be dropped after buying the missing pass new mission starts gods and monsters is still in the drop pool medusa prices drop if gods and monsters wont be dropped anymore medusas would rise
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,prices drop
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mostly because of the prices dropping lets say you bought a doppler for keys after the operation comes prices will drop and the doppler will most likely be less than what you paid for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,market is flooded with new drops so prices on them drop some even appear on market so people usually like to keep their wallets maxed out for any such instancesif bots dont snipe them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im happy i cashed out before the new case hit and before the operation will hit soon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it was really fun buying my entire inv right before the case dropped like less than hours before
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahhahahahhahaha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,operations are like new maps and stuff that get introduced into the game same with a case example phoenix breakout vanguard etc you can buy yourself a coin which you can level up and stuff wich costs around euro so a lot of people will sell their cheap stuff to buy the pass knives are also effected sometimes depending if they introduce something big like chroma knives and gamme knives
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol keys over sa nice

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello upixelzcsgo your post has been removed because rankings are not permitted this includes but is not limited to world statistics pattern rankings tiers and bestworst pattern it is permitted to include the float rankings on a database site example number three float on csgoexchange currently refer to items by their pattern index number example pattern index is the ak ch scar pattern and if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment you can use the acronym bta instead of maxlots of pinkbluegreencyanlime pink galaxy or tier
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,shiit i shouldve gotten me one of those when i had the chance for lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you could get a st one for this price prob not but still just saying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wtf just sell it lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,are you going to be playing the game if youre not and dont plan on trading why would you want to keep it you never know what is going to happen to this economy and just letting it rot while hoping the prices go up is the worst idea you can have
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sell what why economy is going up and i might play csgo again you lose too much from selling and almost all items are collectors e is asking for reasoning too much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,a bit more detail please
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what do you recommend i do with it then trying to cash it out would be nearly impossible given the fact most of the items have their value in the specifics stickers patterns floats i dont see a reason for most of them to go down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,seems like its set in stone that youre keeping it all therefore this post is pointless
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there will never be more howls craftedopened therefore since the demand is high they wont lose value and probably just gain value
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you want to keep your skins this bad why you even bother asking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,possible to cashout a lot of people on this sub make profit based on stickerspatternsfloats take a day or two and learn the prices again after that get premium opskins and just cashout
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am asking for an explanation on your reasoning im not just going to attemp to sell all of my items based off of wtf just sell it lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i mean on them i dont know prices anymore but it only seems like id be able to get if even and acquiring them wouldnt be easy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why does everyone keep saying this i have zero knowledge of the current economy and i want to see if there is a better option why would you ever trade something you like obviously because there was a better option
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats the thing it would take hours to do all of that which i really dont want to do is just letting it sit better for me nothing else
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just look around on reddit just search and then sort by new then you should get an idea of the price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because you act like you dont want to sell your skins noone knows if prices will keep rising what if trading bots will get removed what if source comes out noone knows how the csgo economy will look like in one year you can be lucky and your skins are worth more or your not so lucky and your skins lost a lot of value if you wanna take that risk keep your skins otherwise cash out and do something nice with the money but you should consider your items are not howlsdloressapphirerubys etc even when prices will keep rising your items will only rise moderate

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would personally try to get about from it but you may be able to get higher if you are lucky enough to find a collector edit note that my calculation includes percent of sticker price which some people may not want to pay its all just about finding the right buyer you may also want to get a second opinion as i am not the most experienced pricechecker

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,market price patterns are a scam unless you find someone dumb enough to pay extra of buyers will pay market its only worth an extra keys to the right person
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,finally someone who thinks the same xd i get so pissed off with those has full angel and diamond heart stripe on playside keys over market it doesnt make it look any nicer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,honestly of the community will agree that zebra looks the nicest and its a tier pattern of slaughters contain the tier patterns that people claim are rare the whole pattern industry is a giant fucking scam it annoys the shit out of me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,slaughter patterns are overrated af tbh i would never pay over market for any plus most of the time i cant even see thepattern properly like i see no angel on the flip lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent for bo for the
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,price is bit too high for sure its scratched not best position skin itself is pure shit only sticker and non holo i get the meme but still l really dont think youll sell it for that but you can never know gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,plz kill me or upvote not allowed to ask its against sub reddit rule remove it before mod take down this post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youre not allowed to ask for upvotes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yup scratched stickers are worthless not not maybe sticker which would about usd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahahahahah u dont get the main idea its not a fckng blue lam its a damn safari mesh and its fkng rare to get with such sticker it is a meme and ppl do pay for this stuff xd plz kill ur self
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,only sticker and non holo omg do u know holo howling dawns xd xd xd omg why do such ppl even comment on reddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well is bit to little but yea imo would be fair
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahah lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,l get the meme there are like awp safari meshes with howling dawn so its not very rare l would get it if it had like of them or ibp holo on back or something but for it is realistically too much but if you think so
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no fcking shit there aren´t howling dawn holos but added that holo because l referred to katos howling dawns and katos pretty much go to the same category of high tier stickers and when there is a kato skin with holo it adds more than non holo in if you didn´t know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ez for such meme already had a offer on alias but i ignored it coz it was my play skin for a long time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yup sorry man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nvm exchange just shows of them so there are even more probably

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the way i see it there are three different types of traders a profit traders they dont care what the skin is as long as theyre making money off of it its usually difficult for two people in this category to trade together considering they both want to make money b play skin traders they usually trade just to get skins they normally wouldnt be able to afford or to get a skin they for cheaper than paying the total cost of it personally this is how i trade c rich traders its in the name theyre usually rich as fuck they buy and sell super expensive items at their own leisure simply because they can they dont care about profit theyll pay the full price for a skin if they want it when they dont want it anymore theyll sell it regardless of the market assuming you dont have many skins ill assume youre not a trader in the c category if you want a big inventory id also assume that youre not purely interested in money like in the a category this leaves the b category play skin traders what i used to do when i had the time for it was buy low and midtier katowice stickered skins that were appropriately priced or below what they shouldve been listed at and sell them for a key or two over what i bought them for this way of making profit was slow but i didnt mind since i wasnt in it for the money i used the extra keys i got over time to save up for skin i wanted like a cyrex fn thats not considerable expensive at on the market or keysish but considering i traded up to it over time starting at a key kato skin i think that its pretty good this is just what i did there are tons of niche markets where you can get a skin that fits well into one and sell it to the right person for a ton of profit some examples would be souvenir skins good signatures good floats good matches etc doppler knives rubies sapphires black pearls max phases etc extreme floats and the likes katowice stickers unapplied prices are rising constantly applied s can vary from to much much more and many more the best general tip you can get has already been given to you and im sure youve heard it before buy low sell high theres lots of terms and general ideas you should probably know too bo is the minimum amount of items whether its keys or skins that theyll accept for a trade co is the current offer from someone that they have analyst is in reference to taking of the price of a skin on the site steamanalyst this is usually used a lot as its a general benchmark agreed upon by most traders sticker is usually applied to katowice stickers where how much they add in value is determined by the skin the sticker the placement and the buyer low tiers can be mid can be and high can be tradebot sites are useful for making quick trades they can also be abused however if i told you how to do that other people here would try the same thing finally if the steam account linked with your reddit account is your only account hours in csgo is next to nothing many people have thousands of hours some of them have multithousand dollar inventories others have nothing but the skins and cases theyve been dropped in game its up to you how much you want to play the game and how much you want to trade trading takes up a lot of time you dont get a inventory overnight unless you unbox something crazy and thats highly unlikely be patient and be kind cashing out is never a bad thing if you need or want the money elsewhere good luck and maybe well trade sometime d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,buy high sell low
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you really just have to find whats most comfortablefun for you some people look for quick sells on this subreddit some gamble some try their luck with casestradeups all depends on what you take joy in good luck dude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,crawl this sub day and night while you eat sleep we basically see the deals which get sold instantly those are the prices items are easy to sell or may be a little more than that look for items at those or lower prices if you succeed sell them here for a higher price rinse and repeat keep doing this would be a tad hard in the beginning then once you get a hang of it you will be able to judge what prices are good what are not
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,most of this advise is okay but some is hardly true trade sites are abusable but till ya get to kara dopplers etc it reslly depends on plusminus key per trade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there are many guides and videos out there that teach different kinds and ways of trading and in the beginning you have to find out which one you are best ateveryone has a different method that they think suits them the best so one cannot possibly tell you what you should do only thing i can say is that always sell at a little profit and discover methods
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is a lot of ways to make profit you should learn about all and then choose some you will use
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u need to go fest xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont really want to give to much strategy away but i can tell you one tip if youre even making cents profit on a trade do it because eventually if you do multiple trades with cents profit it will add up and you can trade bot it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you want to make profit id recommend buying skins with katowice stickers on them and selling them for more than you bought them for or the same with case hardeneds i dont really like trading for profit because it takes way too long to make money when i could work at my job and make much more
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you should know that trading is extremely time consuming finding the right deals just letting you know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whenever i see somebody with these massive investment tories filled with knives and things they almost always say its from trading its from buying lots of stuff with their credit card
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ill give you the same advice someone gave mebuy low and sell hightry to buy for steam analyst price and sell for care at special patterns and rare stickers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,heres how dont it looks all fun but you need to start with around and even then people say you will only make around keys a week or so its incredibly hard to trade nowadays and it is only getting more difficult
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,buy keys and with keys buy quick sells
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just dont trade for profit its stupid unless you are at the top of the chain you will be pretty much wasting time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thumbs up for all the b traders d playskins ftw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this about sums it all up i would also briefly include checking cashout sites opskins and bitskins and csgolounge when comparing prices or looking for something you want additionally checking potential trader profiles vs steamrep to know if you are dealing with a known scammer although you should always be on alert and double or triple checking your trades regardless of steamrep
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,best answer on this thread by far this man knows his shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hi trinity p hows your pp going p btw its kind of u to share ur knowledge in such detailed manner to inexperienced trader d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,out of all the threads with a similar question this is the best answer ive seen great work
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for actually giving a proper answer to something
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,best answer on that question ive seen so far
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good ass explanation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,leems segit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,exactly you just have to find your own thing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,considering i sit on my ass and play counter strike all day im sure i have enough time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i love being downvoted for this but its true you dont get a big ass inventory just by flipping dopplers and katos lmao you put a fuck ton of money in to this game you hand over your fucking digits lets be real here for once
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,started from times because i was dumb and scammed started selling cases then bough gun and started trading now i have around inv i sold like already
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,worst way to make profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats bullshit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good point using opskins and bitskins is the best way to buy and sell your skins steamrep is a necessary tool for keeping yourself safe from scammers thanks for this p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think this is just about everything that ive learned over the course of trading i dunno everything yet
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol got scammed out of got the guy banned on steamrep oh well you win some you lose some
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pro tip dont buy when youre high p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,depends on what you call massive a friend of mine could have a inventory if he wouldnt have cashed out twice the fucking digits he handed over massive dollars
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,kind of but is still a profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh is it tell me how much you are making an hour from trading then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,np otherwise i think you did a wonderful job summarizing traders and trading in a nutshell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the knowledge isnt the impressing thing imo no offense but the fact that you took your time to type out this essay of a comment for a very new trader is really nice of you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,at least he wont get to scam other people anymore 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 only go for reputable ones u should really consider changing pp to btc and use bots instead
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,buy high sell sober
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,an hour lmao i have a life too i trade because its fun to trade but also because making money is fun i wouldnt trade if i didnt make profit but i wouldnt keep trading if it wasnt fun i also love the aspect of helping others and learning as i go i wouldnt be making a website just to help people trading if i only wanted money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tbh its all the stuff i wish i was told when i first started trading so i didnt lose like my first trade lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,funny thing about that he was friends with two very reputable people on my friends list and he had pages of clean cash rep that was totally legit something mustve happened so that he became a scammer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,reallize when sober
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so you just kinda proved me right i wouldnt keep trading if it wasnt fun all i said was dont trade for profit cause it aint worth it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha yeah sounds reasonable
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,should i invest like now or wait a bit for the market to get stable again also should i just buy keys with the
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe his family has some serious shits going on going thru difficulties i had a good friend same thing too family issue everything gone too unlucky scammed borrow some ppls money and returned later on hmmm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i said i wouldnt keep trading if it wasnt fun but i trade for profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys are constant so you can invest in keys at any time and theyll remain stable prices are still rising but im guessing theyll fall once the operation and the chinese version of cs drop just a guess
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes i understood what im saying is theres no point in just trading for profit cause you wont make any money from it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i will probably wait than
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well i guess i havent made keys from trading for profit then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how long you been trading for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for howl

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how did you say i know what i saw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not arguing what you saw saying that they got screwed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,still need added you on steam names ckl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know someone with one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,added to talk
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i recently got ridd of alot of skins because a friend said i should make my inventory more personal i did this because i traded a bit too much you have a few options keep it how it is trade all skins for more expensive skins on primary t and ct weapons or make it more personal
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,primary weapon skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,would you recommend selling on opskins or for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,from what i can find no bots take cheap skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the best site is csmoney they accept veeeery cheap skins just not i know this will get removed but seriously everyone knows to only use tradebots as a last resort and other people will have just pmed this guy anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gamblers tend to not use skins when they win them they just accept the trade then gamble more
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,he has vac ban on record days ago so he couldnt have traded or sold it anyways if he still has it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn man congratulations
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahaha many people dont know that float also is sick just dont rage bet it too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i once got an hot rod with crowns from betting so yeah sometimes people dont care about the stickers as they want profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey i brought a cobble pin off you the other day
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i once yolod my whole inv on lounge which is even worse cause even if i win i dont get my shit back blacksiimov and vulcan with nice sticker cant remember which i just didnt know this subreddit and lounge took forever to sell stickered skins blacksiimovs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can someone pm me gambling sites please im serious google does not help with this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i saw someone gambleand lose a crowned icarus fell i cant say anything though i gambled an awp asii with a vox holo to get it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,coinflipped an awp asiimov on a site that uses points instead of directly using the skins took the coins and withdrew an awp graphite
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe he caused the vac ban himself cause he saw it as the absolut way to not tradegamble anymore could be farfetched though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks after checking exchange the howling dawn is scraped but i couldnt tell either way its worth a lot over market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am never nbsp never nbsp n e v e r nbsp selling it d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey whats up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you have never gambled i dont advise you to start doing so its a very painfull road to go through if you dont have a lot of self control
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,a crowned icarus ouch to whoever lost that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the float is good aswell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its not going to sell for any crazy amounts over market its no big deal for someone who gambles
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha thanks man i just lost so far was up to and wanted double to then cash out lost it and my investment p stopped now no fun lol

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello ueaglesong your post has been removed because you must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item you buy trade or sell here eg keys for an awp asiimov ft or a flip scorched ft for a gut safari mesh bs if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you must specify at least one buy out example karambit emerald fn bo emerald fn
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item you buy trade or sell here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what do u mean market price for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rofl these prices are horrible ur asking over market for basically everything and full market for the things that sell for less than it ur asking more for mw items than the fn versions sell for lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahahahha nice prices

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its lags steam my bo for ak keys know if interested add to steam
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,isnt the number pattern correct me if im wrong but pretty sure thats the pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,world ranking lists are explicitly disallowed as they have more often than not been used in price manipulation you cannot state it is a tier or pattern ch or rank crimson web or best slaughter you can state that it has the best float on csgoexchange currently or worst float currently of csgoexchange
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mentioning price checks in trades is not allowed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont seem to find any difference in both of them apart from pattern index please let me know where am i wrong so that i can improve
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,were the rules updated im sorry was not aware of it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea youre rightidk fuck chs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its been like that for a few months now no worries
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fv because dank memes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fv float kelvin is degrees celsius which is considered the technical lowest possible temperature would be perfect with a avalanche w
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fv because it amuses me

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks to all of you that participated winning number is congratulations to upapahypu ill get to work for your dank skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you got those the wrong way around its which is which is considered to be the lowest possible temperature because its the temp at which atoms dont vibrate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good luck man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and enjoy the bizon upapahypu
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks dude d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,o whoops yeah i couldnt make it negative to i just made it k to celsius which is freezing point but forgot to change my explanation lol thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no problem man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,unless there are no mw and fn vulcans with ibp holo there are not much point in saying its the only ft one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well have you seen and mw andor fn ones up for trade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,unless there are no mw and fn vulcans with ibp holo there are not much point in saying its the only ft one plus this is like arguing that a float dlore should cost as much as any other regular dlore just because there are skins with better float not saying that this is a dlore but one way or another whoevers interested has to choose between paying whatever price the owner of the skin with better float even assuming he has the ibp holo on wood as well or crafting one himself
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,considering you said there are only of them and only ft i thought you might know if there are any mw or fns too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,plus this is like arguing that a float dlore should cost as much as any other regular dlore just because there are skins with better float no its not because we dont even know if the other vulcans are mw and fns in that case your vulcan is the worst one but if there are no mws or fns your vulcan is the best one thats why there is no point saying its the only ft one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for example if someone puts theirs up for trade with the ibp holo on wood as well with better float obviously id have to adjust my price according to s price the fact that only st vulcans have ibp holos means that theyre rare what are you thinking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,from what i remember there are mw vulcans with ibp holos and fn one im certain this one was above average though i still get what you mean but despite this one being the worst i cannot use any of the better ones a price benchmark hopefully you get what im saying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it means that the vulcans with ibp are rare yes but it doesnt mean that your ft vulcan is good or bad because see my other comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was incorrect there are more mw vulcans but they do not have the ibp holo sticker on wood that still doesnt change the fact that theres nothing that stands as a benchmark for my price if i see any mw st vulcan with ibp holo on wood going up id alter the price of this skin accordingly whats wrong with that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,added you to talk endaman
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent for my flip auto mw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,accepted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sorry will want an overpay that offer is not even close to the value of my knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pced my knife is anyway tq for the reply
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,np
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you claim it is flawless then atleast post screens you cant see anything with this metjm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i will get screen of the corner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item you buy trade or sell here examples keys for my knife karambit fade for keys bayonet forest ddpat mw for bayonet boreal forest ft make sure that you have not stated that you will pay up to you have stated a bo for all your items you have specified a condition for every item you are tradingtrading for if you are trading for specific floats you have specified how much you will pay for different floats if you want a range of items eg any key knives you have listed some example knives and how much you will pay uthisfeelsdangerous please httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules before you do anything else on the rglobaloffensivetrade subreddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,be more specific
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how about kara tt pixel corner co
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my keys are on hold i added you on steam we can talk about it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why wouldnt someone sell them on op netting
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ever tried cashing out on op
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it takes as few as clicks to list keys including price changing then however many to confirm a trade note not saying in profit just blocked purchases and current acct value for privacy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im talking about actually withdrawing the money not just listing stuff for sale some people will pay a premium ie reduction in price just to get the funds into paypal immediately rather than waiting for op to process a cashout
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,one hour request fee brings it to so if someone is desperate and wants the more risky way your benefit is less than one cent per key

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i gave away worth total and havent created a post about it oops sry reddit i just did with this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,still a better love story than twilight
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,here men you da best
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so many people are shitting on your story but i enjoyed it a lot thanks for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rhumblebrag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so cute
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,quick question how do you have items in your cs inventory when the limit is o
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rhumblebrag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rhumblebrag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i like it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,best love story of all time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,paid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so if i send you a free ak redline ft i will get a karambit ruby later on ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my first time buying keys i got sharked for a kato skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lads biblethump
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would do the same but the dude blocked me welp his loss
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and people question how this is a humble brag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because you did it out of generosity and dont need recognition for your actions until now s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,in a giveaway subreddit here still no humble brag other than this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because yr a streamer maybe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rexpected
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dropped items ingame maybe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you can exploit max inv space there are a lot of tutorials in youtube for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you have and you trade item for you get items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i got items when i sold my dlore for pure then someone also accepted tt for and i went from bc of inventory lag
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how is he at all bragging all hes doing is saying how he kept a promise from a long time ago
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not trying to brag or anything at all ik most generic response im trying to show that sometimes being nice not always looking for quicksell ez profit go fast can be just as rewarding maybe not monetarily but definitely emotionally
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if i sent you a free karambit ruby do i get a ferrari later on ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thatd actually be really awesome to a lot of people
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i felt a little same way d but hey he repaid more than what he shouldve so i think that deserves a little bit of praise d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also fold of a cent skin mathematically never would even reach so this guy is an absolute saint super generous
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i still dont need recognition i use this as an argument to stop posting this stuff all the time generally people give away to make themselves and others feel happy i gave away in times where i was really insecure or unhappy and that kinda saved me so you shouldnt give away just because you want to hit frontpage
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yup i love to brag about my humbleness to my massive followers s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do items still drop when your inv is full because i recently had a full inventory and playing casual i leveled up with that xp thing and didnt get shit and didnt get any drops for weeks until i made space on my inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this doesnt work as the items on market are still counted as if they were in your inventory if you have items and put items on market your csgo inventory still shows up as items valve more than likely did this on purpose
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no that doesnt work as the trade doesnt allow you to accept on your part
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not true
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,everybody except sociopaths believe in karma and know that doing something good will have positive consequences still no need to post it on reddit there are dozen of people who gave away stuff up to very expensive knives and yet you dont know about it because there is no need to post it on reddit also what do you plan on acquiring with this post greedy people will stay greedy and kind people will stay kind you wont be able to force others to change just with this post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can confirm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hes almost on the same level of generosity as the lamborghini guy offering knowledge
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,skipped math classes didnt you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they have cent denominations now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,x
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well if you looked i said i payed him back more than fold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,class act right here op should pay more attention to ufreakesport
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,blablabla
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you sure i went above items because of a trade once but i wasnt at or over at the moment of the trade i was after
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,everybody except sociopaths believe in karma wut
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i thought he was offering us free bookshelves
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,your generosity will be sung in songs and echoed through the winds of history for generations to come
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i tried getting pure for my dlore after selling my bayo ruby for and i wasnt able to go over the limit at all also tried selling an tt after having pure and wasnt able to do that either
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,your steam level didnt help
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats a lie
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im referring to sociopathic characters people that are twisted as fuck and or slightly autistic
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks thats good info to know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,til im a sociopathic slightly autistic twisted fuck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because you dont think that positive negative actions will have consequences no thats not what my words mean

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,once a scammer always a scammer even tho you gave it back you deserve to be marked anyways dont seek for attention on this sub please
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol nobody here cares u deserve it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,imo op should have his rep clean he returned everything he scammed which most of scammers dont do if hell do it again thats no doubt should result in a permaban but i think he deserves a second chance tho my opinion doesnt matter because idk how to get in contact with steamrep admins d try creating another steam account i guess that will clean your rep for sure
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,everyone there is so merciless you scammed you should be banned etc while i bet most of you sharked someone at least once which is a softer form of scamming i start to think the only thing op did wrong was returning keys back and posting this on reddit he couldve just get another acc trade the keys and live happily or maybe just trade with his old doubt many would care if he would send a legit trade offer thats what you get from being good obviously
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so basically i scammed someone and gave him back all the keys coming to find out that he already filed a report against me and he told me that when i did send him the keys back that he would get me i unbanned so he contacted the owner of cash rep group said that i am still a scammer and that hes not going to un ban me and still get me banned on steam rep which i am just concerned if that happens because i did give the keys back and im afraid that the actions that i didnt want to do and my anger issues made me do will cause me my legitness
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,here before the haters
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,he gave back the items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,op was scammed and decided to scam someone else because reasons when he finally scammed someone of he felt bad apparently he has some conscience and he gave back dude he scammed was still pretty angry wonder why xd and deleted him today op added him back and returned the rest and asked him to get in contact with steamrep to get his rep clean that dude was rather ungrateful and instead told them that op is still a scammer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i swear to god everytime i have a comment to post youve posted it before me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,op was scammed and decided to scam someone else because reasons when he finally scammed someone of he felt bad apparently he has some conscience and he gave back dude he scammed was still pretty angry wonder why xd and deleted him today op added him back and returned the rest and asked him to get in contact with steamrep to get his rep clean that dude was rather ungrateful and instead told them that op is still a scammer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,love ya name bro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks bro i have by polar disorder and it made me do this because of the rage me me getting scammed im glad you feel this way but yeah sadly it wont change probably
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sharking scamming when you sharked someone both parties actually agreed to the trade its the sellers fault if he later on regrets it for selling cheaper than he should have
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah like i was trying to be nice and give the guy the keys back and so i would get unbanned and have a good rep because i felt bad for what i did and now im getting even more hate then i have the reason i dont change accounts is because i have a genuine guardian pin on this account
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think you shouldve contacted steamrepcashrep admins first and explain the whole situation to them anyways new steam account new person soo ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah like i was trying to be nice and give the guy the keys back and so i would get unbanned and have a good rep he even admits he gave them back after realizing that hes been marked as a scammer this kid is just trying to wipe his record clean hes not actually sorry he scammed the kid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sucks to suck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its also meant to say haxxor what up bro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,noone stops you from trading anyways steamrep ban only affects real money trading in case you will have any trouble trading via steam offers you can just trade on secondary account and play on main
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have been trying to get in contact with them for a week and explain to them what has happened and they dont accept my friend request
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mooooooooooooooooooooods hes being mean to me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,we do elitehaxxors men we go fastest
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im interested accept my friend request
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no need to be rude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sorry fixed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,drop the passive aggressiveness you cant know hes a scammer and if you dont have proof theres no need for you to act like an ass consider this a warning
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent bo my dude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hes afk he will accept soon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea im back nwow sry d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so sorry dude someone offered keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its against the rules to accept a offer higher than bo if someone sent bo first just sayin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,didnt know about that sorry didnt look at time either just came back from school
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,upvote because i want to know too p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i used to own httpimgurcomambace but i have no idea about the pattern index neither about where did it go p sorry but gl edit oh i just found a metjm pic of it there you go pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive got this one looks like a max blue idk xd httpsmetjmnetqcwlgstjpg
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my friend has one of the best max blues i believe and he knows all of the max blues
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there are a lot of requirements for an to be a authentic max pattern most patterns that are advertised as mac blue arent even close to being an authentic you have the black bar going sideways through the middle of the blade on an authentic a max blue theres a thin black band no wider than teeth on the spine of the blade perpendicular to the spine on the playside and a very thin diagonal black band passing through the hole the blue on the tip must be darker than the blue and the blue on the side of the blade closer to the tip should be lighter than both the blue tip of the blade and the blue between the hole and where the dip in the blade is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you rusty for summoning me d op almost every knife is a max blue in this subreddit d and tbh there are plenty of them around you just gotta make sure it has one blackbrown stripe in the middle and clear blue tip so honestly pattern index doesnt matter and it will only limit your search that been said i can list some of the nice examples that ive came across are and
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,read my top level comment

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe read the whole fucking sentence
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im sorry for getting a bit hostile yet im quite tired of people pointing out the fact that the gun isnt blue while i specify in the title that im talking about the tip which is only out of the gun

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,stickerprice might even get a bit more
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,one vox is like id take around since its tge only one which would be if my math is correct and then add in the gun price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh dayyyyummmm that is one sexy usp vox is my favourite teamstickers p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wtf happened to the quality in the edited ss oo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,atleast sticker price gun price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this is really rare first of all its same sticker combo second its stat and third its really clean top u should aim for of stickers gun price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,best usp skin decent clean top matching stickers only other sticker from that matches the orion would be the cm st i would start at plenty of people who would pay over
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,man look at my profil i have a ft ak fuel injector with vox and i had offers without even trying to sell above keys that stickerprice just keep it and some will come to you with better offers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ignore who says this is at least shit is deep asf gl selling d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,easily over there are very few kato of the same team on an orion aswell as this thing has a great top
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would be looking for around
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,which is like another at least because its pretty clean
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its a of there are no other orions with more than of these stickers do you think that because of that it would be more than price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mine is betterenjoybby
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,are you new yeah if the gun had like no stickers then maybeeeee but of a katowice sticker that matches a st fn pistol that is the most desired usp skin and is insanely clean yeah look i doubt it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is really low the top is really clean matching stickers that are really expensive
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,id say about maybe is a lot
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,main reasons are its kato combo its st fn and yes makes it more special
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well these stickers are like each right so it wouldnt be expensive for a collector to craft it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i will
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,isnt that rare and the stickers arent holo the market price is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah i didnt mean keys i meant dollars so that would be keys you really think that he could get keys for this it still has a lot of scratches on it base price for an fn orion if keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,regardless of whether the stickers are holo or not value of them is value each sticker is each the more of them on there the more valueable each is valued on there especially if it is float isnt the main idea here either its the top that really counts i sold today for keys where the top played a really key role

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lolwait what should i do now new to reddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,emm lowest
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what should i put in my title then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,interested in high tier five seven blue gems
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i could recognize that scratch on the tip its my old one p i think i listed it for about on a site and it sold pretty fast but that was like a month or two ago prices were a bit higher then keys maybe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yours mad more marks at the front
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn really
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,had got offered already
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes it has a clean front compared to others and good float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have a and no luck on my pc yet did you post it here or what
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes posted it here i
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can u accept my friend request
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you must set a realistic and specific buyout or price for each and every item you buy trade or sell here saying the percent of market is not specific
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,newcrownhype d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so sad to see how people desperatly try to push them again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is very good sticker mate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tactical hype incoming dudi dudi dudi crown back booom s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the prices are gonna take a long time to get even close to those hype days if easy small profit is what you are looking for yes this maybe and just maybe a good investment but every thing has a price point at which traders start selling its called profit taking in trading i doubt it is gonna see like keys ever but keys sure but then you have to take into account present value of money would you rather have keys right now to trade and make or even more in the next couple months or would you rather sit on it and make keys in months i am a firm believer in the former strategy of trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,welcome to retarded reddit users hypes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they dropped so low that everyone thinks now they cant get any lower and that its safe investing in them again id say that they go up to atleast next week as the others that are just jumping onto the hype train will buy every crown that is on offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think the sticker is cool but is not as rare as kato so will decrease instantly where is no demand to pay such a big amount of money for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,uxweakhd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cheapest on that site is buy keys at profit from crown but thats only if they are selling at if its not how that works then i would also fucken wanna know why
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,very good sticker might be seen as some kind of investment you could buy them at their current price and secretly hope for another hype manipulation train and sell them back at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,le hype train
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cheap ass nice ass lookin sticker
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i believe its called doing an investment on the future possible rise of prices this thread is dumb
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,imo the most universal sticker looks great on every skin totally under valued right now and was always destined to rise its cool to see some hype any skinsticker hype in todays market is great to see
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have to get in on this kappa
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how is investing in a sticker manipulating the market lmfao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that is exactly what people want to do there is no crown hype or anything they just want the easy profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,where do you get keys for atm on that site cheapest keys are
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its the crown hype
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is cheap ass for you k
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then dont comment on a dumb thread wat
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,crown in your inventory xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you are a crown owner arnt you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,illuminati confirmed when u have falling on price stickers you need to make something like that it is prety ez make hype with few accs or friends all ppl starts to buying hyped item you sell everything and hype is over you are out with keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but ppl with high cash rep can buy directly from users if u sell ur key on that site theres a fee and paypal so some ppl prefer just to sell their keys to highly reputablerichmotherfuckers traders for u can see posts from time to time keys per key
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bitcoin i think
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,erm i can sell keys if you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you wasted the same amount of money putting a dig kato on the weasel
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this was on front page what a joke
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good marketing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i forgot about them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,erm nooooo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah ive seen those offers lately here and i thought that the offer you mentioned would be bad atm cause x and if you have premium its x but tbh that only counts if the key price stays that high like it is for about weeks or you are selling things often and got premium as long as the price wont drop below
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,almost every top tier key trader is buying for btc so nope
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,someone had to do it s

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well from the price and from the downvotes im guessing you have noticed that this is not really a great price to put you inperspective a non stattrak version in the same position sells for around obviously it should cost extra for a stattrak version but clearly extra is very unreasonable probably looking at max possibly torwards the lower and late if you want a quicker sell but i really dont see it getting past there

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fire serpent would work too i guess since the green snake
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah im going with pit viper probably thanks and ak im going for fire serpent looking for more ideas

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whoops my bad posted a big list of most guns that are green
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah appreciate that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,surely need a good budget for those skins but will do i guess haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,np i couldnt find anything green for the others thats why its not every gun i think you will need to substitute green for blue for most of the others sadly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,since youre going for a kara emerald i dont think your budget is the biggest problem haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no one thought of the usp overgrowth yet doe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have had rubies in the past but time for a emerald i guess
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,didnt even look at usps i went straight to i dont use usp so i never thought about it xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also if you are getting gloves go with sport gloves hedge maze or for a bit more and if you like them more specialist gloves emerald web
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,eh id disagree i think you could get a key extra for that personally
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,key but hard to trade maybe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is it because of those ibuypower stickers they are nice d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks d i thought so d

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay thanks a lot is there any guide about trading skins with stickers because i dont understand a sht about them d i know kato are expensive and has some value but i dont know about others d

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why do u think that your ch costs so much over market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its number float for the pattern it also is playside and backside reverse dragon claw which is pretty rare i also got it pcd at it also looks dope p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,of playside with nonsolid blue costs market number float for average pattern doesnt add anything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha then you dont have to offer me for it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good luck with selling this average ch for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also show me that the nonsolid goes for market thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,over blue both sides hows that average
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol its ok enjoy selling all your average stickers haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and what is average on your opinion lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah average in my opinion is your stickers lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just dont get how more then on both sides is average please explain thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my stickers in summ cost more than your kara lol and btw if u see something in my inventory doesnt mean that this is all i have kid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,httpsmetjmnetkphtainjpg this one cost less than your and hasnt been sold yet i really cannot understand waht miracle should happen that will allow u to sell your kara for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah well good luck selling them and how am i suppose to know you have more stuff you make absolutely no sense kid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha im not selling them kid
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,firstly not mostly kato but all of them and it is full collection and as i see u dont know the prices of them secondly why the fuck u change the vector of the dialog if we talked about your kara thirdly i dont sell this collection it is just for me and i dont create posts like kato full collection and finally as u see i have hours of cs go on this account and if you were not stupid you would understand that it is not my main acc it is just account which is linked to reddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol ok first of all you came in here starting stuff secondly you started talking shit about the kara thirdly i saw your sutff and you said the stickers were worth more then my knife lastly you obvisouly dont know what your talking about because more then both sides is average to you xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,firstlyi came here and gave objective comment about the price of your knife as i used to trade ch and know what i m talking about can doubts about the price fairness be cosidered like starting talking shit about the kara guess no secondly calculate yourself the total price of full collection and u will see lastly as i already said i am familiar with chs and have just told you that it is not even solid blue so the only thing you can do is to pray for miracle
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you came in asked a question i asked it the continued to call it average for more then each side i also you dont have to offer me but you still kept going for some reason like lol you obviously dont know what your saying cuz its more then each side lol also if you see in the title it says im negotiable that doesnt me im firm on had to explain that cuz you dont know what you are doing lmao haha good luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,stop behaving like brainless kid i already sent you this httpsmetjmnetkphtainjpg it is more blue but costs less here is more example much more blue and this blue is solid and it costs pretty equal to your price but looks much better so why will somebody pay for your knife if they can get something better for equal price cuz you dont know what you are doing why u keep repeating this both of us know that i know what i m doing i am trying to explain a dumbass goat that his price is overexagerrated
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol its is both sides not just one side blue get it through your head its both sides
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you also didnt show me the price of those and mine is both sides blue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you legit just shows me two metjms and said they went for less then mine like link or something wtf xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,man and u really think that u are a good trader after it everybody knows and can easily confirm that backside doesnt give much value to a knife especially if it is average blue on playside so calm down and accept your destiny the destiny of looser

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,any interest in a kara dragonclaw kara dopp
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey uwaspgaming your post is removed due to the use of excessive capital letters please refer to rule here httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules this post counts towards your daily
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,isnt this ft price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeh i just paid for a that has headhunters on it just yesterday i also think i got a pretty good deal on it but this is ft price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i assumed that since the difference is on sa this is normal
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i mean the one thing that comes into play is why would someone pay for a ww when they can pay the same if not more for an ft with a cleaner look and lower float p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so whats a good price to be asking i dont see wws on reddit so i cant compare
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and it will sell i suppose maybe if u find a good buyer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i cant really help you there i guess just try lowering it a bit and see if people budge
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its more like buy items super cheap and sell them less expensive everyone is looking for profit just refresh reddit like a nolifer and youll find deals for sure
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you can find ak vulcans fn occasionally for keys on the sub so doubt is an easy sell you just keep spamming the new tab on the subreddit till you see those ez quicksell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,steam analyst gives key price while most people look for prices or less unless its in high demand or unique and you just have to look for good deals items that you have a good chance of making a profit on
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you cannot sell items for of sa price usually items will go for about and quickly at for buying low i tend to just snipe quicksells
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,essentially you can find them on both lounge and reddit but the trick is these items dont come in seconds you have to keep browsing till you find a quicksell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,on steam analyst you can check what how much the skin goes for and how many are sold most people use this price when trading for keys people usually do like of sa of the skin trading is hard
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just refresh and refresh reddit page for quicksells people are poosting there you can get items wich will rise up like if you got that vulcan fn easy to sell it for atleast in few daysweeks the prices went down because of the dota update big update but they will go up again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,vulcan fn have been like for a while dude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ill tell you the simple answer research and patience others will tell you this too but the best way to get accustomed to prices and such is to go around to different places like this subreddit or trade servers and get a feel as to what each thing is going for and where to get flippable items thats where patience comes you just have to wait or sit there for awhile refreshing new till you find a good deal and use the knowledge you got from research to know to buy it personally for me i barely trade do to certain restraints but even so i check this sub at least times a day to check up on prices of things like certain high tiers or ive spent countless hours just going around but that wont even compare to others who spend or the time as me but in the end theres always a little luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you search for ak vulcans fn that were posted yesterday here youll see plenty of them for so its most likely never going to sell for use reddit to find prices of cheap items below you can use the httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradesearchqrestrictsronsortrelevancetall or to easily find items here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,example flip knife tiger tooth fn is keys on sa some guy is selling his for should i take a trade like that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you see flip tts selling often for yes otherwise no
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats my problem could i search in the subreddit for trades with flip knife tts and see if theyre priced at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats usually what i do
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,your problem is you are not doing research enough thats all a guide for you is to write down all the price of what everyone is selling at i dont need to since i can remember then you will know what is a goodbad price is as simple as that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,basically this takes a lot of time right i need someone to seriously like guide me so i dont make stupid mistakes like i did with the ak vulcan
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it does take up a lot of time if you want to make serious profit lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my deal is i still had two pins from the columbus major that i wanted to sell for keys to get an ak hydroponic but now that valve fucked me over i have to try and get those keys this way i just want to eventually have like keys thats really all

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,looks like a tough one to find coz the sticker is expensive
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,man i got exited but i have a st bs one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,honestly i think the sticker price goes up a lot more for something iconic like replicating a pro gun be surprised to see one for a seller could just easily ask for more than that and get it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then theres a rule ur breaking lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why is it getting removed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you broke another rule you didnt state which skins

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold previously at on op priced at rn will probably drop in the future since amount of fn will increase and looks like its not a really hyped skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey man thanks for the detailed post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,actually one was also sold at recommend to use this price while its still that high since it seems to be decreasing quite unexpectedly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey udetcon your post is removed due to the use of excessive capital letters please refer to rule here httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules this post counts towards your daily
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wow rip format sorry guys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,heyo ukcmclan your post has been removed because some aspect of your title is considered clickbait double check the following your bo matches the part of the title your title is specific and you have not only stated keys or keys please refer to rule if you need further clarification and if you have any questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would say max above mp
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you have to set a specific buyout please read the rules to understand what a valid buyout is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,offer me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how much would you offer for no bo atm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmmm fnmwft howl bo keys i dont get what isnt understandable in that part
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would give you for that if you want fast
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont like how your profile is private i want ingame pics of that one before i answerand i want to isnect ir on my screenatleast inspection linknot metjm pic
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,explain me how its specific
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i mean i guy who owns howl fn surely isnt gonna fucking come and offer me for range closer to i dont get what you mods on this site want to creat for every float a specific bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i do need keys fast but lowest i was thinking was
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ummm you have low floated ft howls who run in bos for keys then you have low floated mw ones going in rangethen you have fn ones going above of these prices in comunity arent specific therefore i cant determine any specific price i can just put some range price that is based on items float and look on that costumer who wants to sell its item can use damn sense to determine in which part hisher item belongs plus some of those prices have moved by keys in last hoursthere you go another reason i think that this way is pretty understandable by that what you people want me to create post should be like this howl keys howl keys mins of scroling down howl keys then the same with next item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh waiti forgot to put bo in there howl bo keys howl bo keys mins of scroling down howl bo keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you have to list an specific buyout for every item you buy ex kara damascus steel mw x keys kara damascus steel mw x keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keep it civil rules are here for a good reason and they are clear it allows everyone to trade easily buyouts are clear and even if it seem useless it prevent things like he doesnt accepted my howl mw while his buyout is for a they wont change
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,check out my fs little higher float but stickers valued at about interested

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,read your previous comments and i guess i saw you offering keys for lore fn fv days ago as well as if bots are paying each then you could easily get any fn lore keys for your lore then why dont you try that you might end up getting more than your bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,holy in one go
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what my friend got from csm lore he sniped it for on bots they gone for each no or smth changed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,divided with which one key is worth it is but yeah i am obv wrong xd and i am not interested in getting higher floats cause i can get even more with those lowfloats but you seem like you know all pretty good
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,divided with which one key is worth it is but yeah i am obv wrong xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,only vanilla keys are and other keys are which comes around and the number of keys is less than or so how would you withdraw at the same time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you know that they are not on your side and good luck withdrawing keys on csm genius
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it is okay thta you want to legitimate your offer but you do not get one with a reason and i told you the reason why you just started to act like an asshole but nvm and no all other keys were also this morning they might have change a bit and you still get more for any float buit it is okay
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just for you my friend but yeah keep talking that i am not right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do that several times a day and they are still
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks man for your great help and btw there is guy selling lore for check comments so i guess you should lower down your lore bo to and take out keys from bots go fast men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,still good luck withdrawing pure keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,look when awp is on your side its only gonna be and normal keys are max you can get it and you would not be able to get that much in one trade from csm this guy is giving for any lore now can you just fuck off
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nvm tho it is okay you give this price cause you have a great heart
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this is still a bad price for a lore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont worry he will withdraw keys in a single trade and currently there are around keys on csm lets wait for keys kapishonas
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you have the name of the site in your name on steam i guess not so plz stop taliking and bullshitting here is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sure thing lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont worry you will not get a lore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you see the point is that the item is in bots inventory not in yours in your inventory it would be cause the bot takes of rare weapons if you have csm in your name now divide that by and you get gl getting that much keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah sure mate btw bots are paying keys now so so any fv keys ez keys more than your bo mate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it is in my inv like you see i have of them and did the screenshot of my inventory

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah it sucks nevertheless low float and nice fade karambits are pretty rare so thanks for your advice though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,would you be interested in items like redline stats each rest in keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,honestly your best bet is to trade them to one of the trade bots almost no one in their right mind would want a st mw chroma knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,extremely bad trade no one wants a flip stat and mw knife when the fn is available for much cheaper your best bet would be to put it on market and hope it sells
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trade bot can i get some info
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol no one is going to buy your awp for full price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,should have put in there

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey ujarredsel you are posting here too often we currently allow sale posts per day you can read the rules here httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules you may post again in hours and minutes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,use less saturation thats really all i can say theyre nice d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as ucatsayslol said tone down and the saturation and try not to make the text the focal point of the whole image i would try to avoid using edgy slanted fonts and go for a more clean look
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why are they so far out youre either using the meme resolution or you have a really weird view model other then that theyre pretty good for a beginner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,use a higher resolution look like theyre rendered in
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would avoid using lens flare
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you your screenshots edits are sick btw d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do you have any good fonts
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i did use if ill try my pc will probably explode edit probably cause im using fov or something
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,made this in my pc cant handle more than that infact it goes to like fps on that edit maybe it looks like its rendered in cause i resized the viewmodel on photoshop it would take up too much space without resizing it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmm why imo it makes it look better
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no worries gotta keep us editors on eachothers back yanno xd thanks a lot ahah
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they have potential but they just look low res
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i mean ultimately its up to the creators decision and opinion on what looks good for himher but lens flare has been around for a loooong time if you want to improve as a designer to the point where you want people to pay you have to be aware of design trends and what the consumer usually prefer with any type of edits httpimgurcomadbrib i know its not too well made but it looks way better than the original and all i did was a bit of cc and subtle lighting brush tool with hardness the usual blur of the background a lot of people liked these types of edits as it looked cleaner im not saying i know a lot about graphic design but i bought my first knife doppler from charging people for twitter revamps and worked for esports teams in au and im not bragging in any way i just want to share what worked for me and what my previous clients wanted tldr its up to you on what you think looks good but if you want to start charging for edits be mindful of design trends and what the consumer wants
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,httpimgurcomaauhxy any tips for mine big fan of your work
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just the viewmodel or basically everything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you for the tips but how do i really look for current design trends do i just check what style people who recently didstill doing ss edits used ps imo your ss edit is beautiful
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also op your screens are nice but would agree with cat on lowering the saturation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sorry man but kind of everything looks like with low shaders potential though real high potential for you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you p yeah just look around not just in ss edits but also just designs in general theres a huge community on esports graphic designers that take their stuff seriously you can also take other peoples criticism and apply it to your work because it shows what the people like to see in a designers work then mix those to your own style and go from there
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you will lower saturation on my next works
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,aww thank you d ill try to see what causes it to look so bad can png or taking screenshots with prtscrn key be the issue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe use in game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,didnt really understand what you meant is httpiimgurcomcyzyszgpng better
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that looks times better nice screenshots man id personally cut down on the saturation abit but thats just me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you dyeah others told me that too guess ill need to keep moving sweetfxs folder outside and inside csgos
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u dont get shit for free
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats not true but continuing being negative like usual lol

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,really overpriced bro this is like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks for the advice will be updating this later
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how the gun should not take away that much value when the skin colors match its not like it was slapped onto a well worn or battle scarred skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the thing is the number of ak blue lams out there with kato is too high and the demand for the skin is low since its a cheap skin people dont want to spend too much on it thus even if the stickers match plus keys is like of sticker price most kato sell at for a single sticker comes up when theres of them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no one will ever pay close to sticker price for one nonholo sticker on a blue laminate sorry but im very experienced in these kinds of items and can tell you as a fact that no one will pay close to the amount you are asking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so what would be the recommended amount of keys for something like this im honestly just trying to get a knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,id start at keys buyout but take anything over
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u could try only buying quicksells so u know u will make profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont forget to just enjoy playing with the skins you have not everything is about profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if youre losing keys because prices are bad just wait til they are better and if you can make profit from screenshot edits why not do them while you wait for prices to be fixed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive have the same problem
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no better time to get involved now all these knives will increase sale ends today they will all increase
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah ive done that then qs turn into normal price xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah im planning to cashout on a laodout when i hit a goal but idk how to get to it if i cant make profit p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah thats what im doing these days ahah
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it sucks so much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,are you sure i feel like a lot of them wont change at all
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats why u always sell right away dont hold on to anything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ik feelsbadman

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rip title supposed to be
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sad life xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fuck wasted a post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ik how it feels done it yesterday
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just d title nthin else oo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no kappa ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i sent offer for ww lore also added if you want to discuss
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tbh people are just dumb as fuck all of them are valuing their items according to certain betting and gambling sites everyones like hur dur kara doppler is diamonds atm want keys pure and if those bastards manipulate the market again putting those exact karas on diamonds ppl are like hur dur kara doppler is diamonds atm better qs it keys pure instead of listening to the market which should be the only price indicator to listen to every little bitch whether its in this subreddit or on lounge or whereever is falling for this manipulative bullshit fuck those people
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,theyre in denial ㅋㅋㅋ
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for reasons because prices are preety low right now and nobody cant accept it cares about market prices anymore nowdays bet price market price its a shitty system but nothing to do thats what i think and i can see reading threads maybe im wrong but thats my point of view
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because the market is low right now in a few weeks the prices will go back up and anyone with half a brain knows not to sell during a down period the people who are all suddenly trying to buy dopplers know this as well if they buy now they can make an easy key profit in a few weeks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have been trying to buy a certain item for market price and being downvotes af i will buy it from the market xxx them all
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,doppler randomly dropping keys below market from week ago yea definitely not any manipulation going on right there ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because they want to go trade fast and market price wont let them do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because what someone feels an item is worth is double its actual worth thats why i avoid slaughters cancer hardened and crimson web items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so youre talking about the doppler that was on the front page today the first reason is their was another guy on the front page below him buying at keys secondly the market is really low right now and it is most likely going to somewhat go back to where it was two months ago before compendium and summer sale hope this helps answer youre question also i do agree with lots of the other comments saying that betting sites value it at so much and that does have an impact on price and it is really easy profit when prices go back up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im posting my items for like market and i usually sell all stuff i have now xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because not so long ago those knives used to be and they cant take the reality that their knives doesnt worth as much as they used to
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,like i can understand things like rubys that arnt even on market but to say a knife is worth just doesnt make any sense why should new people come to this reddit if it is just cheaper to buy from steam market and not scamable
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so should we stop saying market price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nice how you glossed over the fact that gambling site double reduced prices of those knives and thats why they have dropped recently
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but to convert inventory into steam currency you lose at least minimum
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that doesnt make sense to me im talking about people wanting to buy items market price and people saying that is too cheap
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im talking about static items like tt and dopplers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,or you know the gambling site adjusted the price of that knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats not what im saying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the problem is that you cant turn keys into steam wallet via click id buy everything i want from market if i could but my wallet seems to be empty instead my inventory is full of keys or items but keys cant pay the price on market for example if a new person comes into trading theyll most likely do the following mistake they pay their steam wallet via paypal or a wallet code but thats very very inefficient even buying on op is somewhat inefficient the most efficient way seems to be buying bitcoins trading them for keys and trading the keys for quicksells to sell those on market but something like quicksell does not really exist anymore cause people stopped valuing items market if it comes to qs they value it doublediamonds etc but doublediamonds dont do shit if it comes to buying skins from market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lets put it in different words then the owners of the gambling sites are dumb as fuck because theyre too lazy and too greedy to implement a functioning system which calculates the value of an item according to the steam market thats the only legit way to value the items a user is able to deposit everything else is not legit valuing kara dopplers is the perfect example first insanely high then afterwards insanely low if you want to tell me that this has nothing to do with manipulation youre very naive additionally if steam analyst comes up and says yeah awp dlore fn is not on market but now and then its sold for it does not mean that the item is worth that much there are so many factors which come together like wear value for some skins also patterns and so on that giving out an average price is totally dumb this is why it should be prohibited to let external sites take price indications for items which appear in many different forms maybe even items that are not on the market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as of right now yes because of the huge price drops and the probability that prices will rise in the future personally i would not buy anything right now as its uncertain whether prices will continue to fall for chroma knives or whether they will increase again after the hype dies down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,right now yes nobody trust on market prices anymore and gambling sites take control of all the prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that has nothing to do with ops question he didnt ask why it the prices fell so why should i include it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hes going to realize that and learn that he is a dumb fuck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,manipulation rubies and sapphires shot up overnight when chroma came out for no reason and tiger tooth items went up sharply theyve dropped since the steam sale and gamma case and people are still holding firm to old prices because they forced them up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is that a question or a statement
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then we get the groundwater skins scenario all over if they let the skin prices adjust themselves auto acc to market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,got it from market and cheaper so i think ur the
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont know why you call him dumb if he can get it cheaper on the market yes he has to sell his stuff on the market but if he can get it cheaper on there why wouldnt you buy it from it then people are just getting tired of those bullshit look at this knife its at least market even when they have a shitty ft slaughter patter for example
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tts didnt go up at all at least karas didnt didnt trade the rest
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,indeed man ended up getting from market for keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tt karas jumped keys from to depending on the floatcorner back in january you couldve a kara tt for easy now theyre for a qs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,send me offer for keys fair
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,co me keys plz
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ill give you rn for the butterfly knife slaughter

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,he never said every item is a qs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,first line of his title says items qs then the next line starts and there are approxx items for sale so i would say a clickbait
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,see i read it as items quicksales knives collector items etc not as quicksales
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so you put a comma in by yourself alright but why would you read a line as something which it is not and not as something what it is

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im interested
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im at work atm so cant watch the video whens the likely release date o i hope they do more of these coop story missions
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i love how posting this sort of shit your making a panic post and everyone else will read this and sell their shit too and no one will make any money no one even knows if he is right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and on topic i dont know about the prices some might say prices will rise when the op is over so they still need to rise because they dropped from op wildfire and the price is still low and wont drop further where others might say the prices will drop even further because a new op is coming if you want to take a riskyish investment with your money and can afford to lose it keep them if its a lot of money for you and can not handle to lose which is possible sell them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sell ur stuff man dont worry you will recover
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the worst literally the worst you could do right now is quickselling like every little kid is doing stick to your fking skins and hope for the best
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trade them up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,operation wont come out for a month dont listen to mcskillet
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,theres usually a longish break between operations i highly doubt the operation will be launched next week id say at least days
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,happy i cashed out dont gotta deal with this bs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,two weeks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mcskillet thinks the operation will come out in under weeks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its probably the best thing for me to do anyway i was considering switching back to a few more expensive items instead of so many cheaper ones
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but last time he made that type of video he was right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i invested in alot in gamcs and rs skins i hope they wont come back in the next operation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they have risen a little since i bought them but the amount theyve risen is my entire profit margin im not really comfortable losing so based on what youve said i might bulk sell them on market ill wait for a few more opinions though thanks for the advice
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,righto thanks for the help
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im not quickselling im selling for the best i can get on market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just commentating so i can remember commentating here if it comes out in under month d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im kinda freaking out what do you think i should do
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,would like to notice the break between last operation and wildfire was months
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,imagine if the icarus wouldnt return o
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i usually trade like lowertier items and sell them as soon as possible i always feel really bad when i buy an item once picked up a kara uv mw float or something for quite ok price which was all my keys at the time i nearly lost my mind when i didnt sell it within days for keys id suggest not going all in to sell them and just put them as bulk on the market try to sell them for what theyre worth no qs maybe try thisonesite where people often seem to buy them for the right price rather than reddit where ppl look for qs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think you should sell them since waiting another months to profit is too long youll take a loss but if youre good enough at trading youll make it up in no time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ok thanks again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmm ok i was thinking that thats the best option since i thought id only have to wait a few months max im fairly sure that i can make a decent amount pretty quickly anyway just buying qs redlines on market thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the corner is not that clear tbh

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,would you swap it for a factory new fuel injector

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,send me fair
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,send me fair
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you could sell everything for pure keys as that would make it easier to buy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why not getting a mw one no difference
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah man im looking for the key price of each of my items as well as the key price of a decent lore to determine i would maybe use csmoney but the biggest issue with that is that it reduces the cost of everything you trade in
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because man i want the best im not really one of those guys that can be satisfied with a mw or ft float even if it looks the same im sure if i got the lore fn at some point id want to trade it up for a lower float thats just who i am haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think the thing is here on csmoney since it causes me to overpay so much and it also doesnt take into account float and patterns and such i would be losing unnecessary money i am wondering if i were to put my items into keys if i would have enough

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know this i am the one who wants the skin to look perfect i got like of the same knives and trade them away if i dont like a scratch or even a line on the knife i just trade it away d worst feeling ever
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah maybe but you should take your time and sell for like btw the gloves are alot above market like keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks man i really appreciate the reply i thought about possibly getting a bayo saph as well its an option haha

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys allready got offer keys for fv
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its mate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think that keys is the lowest price on this community bro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im no expert but have traded a few chs so may aswell try i think on the you could probably get the average price in keys would be lucky t oget more tbh the ak doesnt look too special the second might be worth more than normal but i would have to see it in game the bayo is sorta blazed which isnt as popular as pure blue but could still sell for more than normal to the right buyer one of my fave patterns tbh hope that helps
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,much appreciated
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i had a bfk blue gem way better than that traded for market price lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tt haha in ur dreams
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys for the medusa

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,imo normal price would be with fv and sticker but atm many lv were up and didnt sell for if u wanna qs try but be prepared to get offer if ur lucky wouldnt tell its qs and set bo at if no one offers set lower good luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,would say aroun imo

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,snipe wut
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can i sell it quick when i set a bo for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh shit if it has no flames on the back its worth quite abit more its like almost all deagles have some flames on the back of the gun near the handle
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont really know but ive just seen are up for keys and not sold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,doubt it maybe would sell semi quick
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats got to be one of the cleanest backs ive seen
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u can see some small orange on the back no real flames but not a clean one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh yeah
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,aight gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,does the fact that it was duped affects the price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it has flames on the back though so id go with keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah i saw them too d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,puh dunno tbh havent dealt with low value duped items before
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what are you talking about i dont think youre gonna find cleaner than that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,your deag is worth more than imo the clean back and the float is very rare i would keep a high bo and keep it for a month
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what bot
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ty fyi should i edit my bo great playskins anyway dont mind keeping it for a month or
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nothing special normal price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,never mind sorry jumped the gun on that a tad lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,another dodge ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think gambling sites will soon have the are you pornsite disclaimer and btw i dont think all gambling sites are scummy like csgolotto is
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wondering the same thing but the mods will most likely take this down
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,holyshit speechless about csgolotto
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,at work atm cant watch videos summary please
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when your ticket has been unanswered since fucking april
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why is this removed shouldnt the people of rglobaloffensivetrade see this shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,does anyone still have the link to the video its removed and i cant see the link
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,csgo gambling isnt good and the owners of the sites are deceivingand valve is deceiving as well with cases
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,general stuff people are gambling on a website called csgolotto gambling is performed with skins which can be cashed out on websites edit thanks to uxxtzkzxx and usplendidfd for that information theres a lawsuit against valve for helping gambling websites such as csgolotto but allowing people to login with their steam accounts this has created a market where unregulated gambling can thrive teenagers are getting addicted the youtubers and owners two guys have over subs on their two channels they post videos of winning big on csgolotto they own the csgolotto website they never disclosed that they own csgolotto because they own the website it is shady and unethical that they even gamble on their website let alone post videos of themselves gambling the videos could easily be faked in order to get people to gamble one owner claims that he never kept it a secret said owner also claimed that when he made videos he wasnt the websites owner which is untrue he was the original incorporater sp of the website satire makes a parody video about getting babies involved in gambling online all credit to
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,called it theyve removed all of these posts today dont know why
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and this is new because if you think about it you purchase things for hundreds even thousands of dollars for a visual upgrade of your game it doesnt give you any special bonusses or stats just the looks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks guys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if the mods are removing this should we just assume they are covering up for their immoral is this injustice
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh yeah one lore big detail csgo lotto is run by tmartn and syndicate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,delluminati
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,who are tmartn and syndicate o
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,big youtubers with lots of young fans and influencethey basically advertised their own gambling site and played on their own site whic is pretty immoral imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,immoral for gambling on your own site meh gambling while young people get influenced by it is more the problem i think i wouldnt gamble on other sites if i had my own as well
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well as they are owners of the site they have very easy access to odd manipulation this in combination with videos like how to make dollar in minutes targeted to mostly immature teenagers is what i call highly immoral
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,manipulation of odds indeed is immoral gambling on your own site if done legit isnt but thats just my opinion everyone has their own
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sadly dont have keys upvoted tho

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,interested in items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fml this is clean upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,st cw mw on exchange keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just depends on the offer if its fair and items arent super hard to sell like ch bta or such im open to offers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it really is looks so good ingame
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not really a fan of the cw but gl with the sale
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no trade keys into skins and you would get more then what he is offering you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no do not do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont doooo it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how many keys is the victoria or am i blind
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,woops forgot to list it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its there now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i myself am not into trading for the profit at all i work full time and each month i get around that i havent spent most times i dont put them into cs but ive done it a couple of times i just want some play skins that i like and dont mind buyingselling with a few not many keys in loss this last month i got to buy a nice and a howl i know i made some loss already but im a happy camper since i like playing with them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,many ppl in this sub dont see csgo items as a commodity if you do its pretty incredible to be able to buy a shiny item play with it for as long as you want and be able to sell it for more than half of what you paid for it in the worse case or with profit pretty often other commodities like smartphones only ever lose value also many serious traders dont hoard items but just try to buy low and sell high which is possible even in a declining market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for me its a hobby no different than buying a nice set of golf clubs playing with them for a couple of years and end up selling them on craigslist for of what you paid because you want a new set
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,they have money the end
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there are people who dont have to deal with a month for a living they can afford it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,skins wins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,risk versus reward really there is a chance the market crashes and you lose everything yes but there is also a chance you make shittons of money with it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i invested and now im around i wont cash out till i quit cus i fucking love this game no matter the flaws
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have invested an substantial amount of money into cs skins pins and in steam leveling in general i dont see it as an investment at all its just a funny hobby for me and even if i only get only out of what ive spent its still wayy better than spending on alcohol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,almost same reason ppl buy clothes skins are not necessarily an investment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same reason people buy different style football boots or paintjobs for cars its not necessarily an investment they just want to have different ways to enjoy their hobby just because its online it makes it no different to having a hobby that involves customization equipment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as its high risk high reward as items may drop by but also can go up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when there is money to be made people are willing to invest
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well some people treat is as a hobby just like how people put thousands into building cars collecting rare comic books etc
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,couse they arent pussies
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to some people its the only game they play got friends like that only play csgo so spend there coin on items rather than more and more games
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty simplepeople still making profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when my inv was around i knew that shit could happen where i wake up and my inv is worthless it probably wouldnt bother me much though since thats the risk you take putting thousands of dollars into a video game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trading with ton of skins is like trading with stocks but easier everyone can make profit out of it just by thinking you dont have to be an expert this way many ppl think its easy money without looking at the risks when you know the risks aswell its pretty much free money so ppl will take the risk calculate it into their business and will still make profit even with these pricedrops
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,moms credit card
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cba to explain but tldr risk assessment is not a necessity in an economy where there is a flatrate item that has previous decessors
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive got a significant amount but ive built it up from very very little so while id hate to lose it all overnight from some steam update im really playing with the money ive made not what ive invested im sure every high level trader is different thats just my experience
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,a karambit fade is the same price as what a shitty karambit doppler used to be theres your answer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mainly because unlike our somewhat efficient capital markets many arbitrage opportunities exist or can be created unfortunately what most people dont realize investing money into skins instantly starts them at somewhat of a loss hypothetically buying a stock worth but if you sold it right then and there it would be worth or so so the cash conversion is a huge hit to any profit made in game would need significant profits from arbitrage sharking people with lounge prices to make actual profit cash profit upon cashing out also way more of a long term play i guess to each their own lord knows i have right now lol but purely for entertainment purposes of trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you could ask the same about other things in life bro you asked a question which is equal as why is the earth a ball why do we live
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im in the same boat as you i just buy skins to play with and then i just do abit of trading to get other skins i like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey internet thanks for buying my howl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea im same i sometimes have disposable income and my bills are all paid so fuck it if i want a medusa to play with ill buy a medusa to play with plus skinswins everyone keeps telling me that so it may be true
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah this is actually a really cheap hobby compared to other ones
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,feelsbadman
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,a month where i live its more than a week wtf
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i understood some of those words yeah
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why do we live though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youre right putting large sums of money into virtual items is incredibly silly if youre wishing to profit realworld money that right here displays the error in your mindset its a hobby people spend money on them there are plenty of people out there that dont want any return at all they just want to have fun with their hobby that includes shiny pixels in this case
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this comment in its self is ignorant you are categorizing everyone who owns csgo skins and puts money into the game into categories there will be people who have a passion for the game and spend so much time on it they want to have the best experience they can they may not be rich or stupid but just want to enhance their experience
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty sure a well known trader here admits to making in his own words between £ and £ a month
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,we are proud contributorssponsors of peoples new computer thanks to tradingthreads
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no problem i like it d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,where i live is more like a week
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is no risk because we already had trading with keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to waste money on csgo obv
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,op is asking about people investing in such a high risk market meaning those looking to make profit out of this this isnt an error in my mindset i was only addressing the scenario of people who want to profit realworld money as with anything people will be willing to spend tons of money on it if they enjoy it and they can afford to im pretty sure op knows this and both me and him only really refer to this situation as an investment obviously as a hobby people will spend money willy nilly wherever they want expecting no profit yes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ok first of all its goddamn rofl he is the exception not the rule by far also theres no way of knowing if hes telling the truth or not or exaggerating
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i did this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to be fair those people could make more working min wage if they wanted too they just have alot of free time and its their hobby
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but people do profit real world money from it they dont need to be ignorant or rich to make money from cs i have profited from csgo and i was humble about it the entire time infact you need to not be stupid to do it either way your comment was ignorant
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what possible purpose would he have for lying about it and there are many many others who live of the profit they make trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,uhuh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same no regrets
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,most other traders and people in general for that matter keep their finances to themselves theres no real reason for him to tell us at all and theres certainly no way to know if hes telling the truth thats how it is and saying that many people live off their profit from trading is a huge stretch
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and youre basing your latter point of what information
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know plenty of people who live off of trading that are from first world countrys those from countrys with broken economies etc live from trading way more frequently and without even being a big name theres thousands of people living off of trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,seriously and youre basing your statement of many many others who live of the profit they make trading off what information if you look at the numbers there are only a couple of thousand at most inventories whose entire worth would be enough to live off for a year then take into account that most of those cant produce enough excess profit to live off and that a large portion of them would be people who just cash in a huge sum of money and dont care about profit seriously are you fucking joking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why are you getting so worked up about a question jesus christ what is wrong with you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,days its escape
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats a sick awp d have an upboat make sure you get an accurate pc those are worth more than youd think idk if youre familiar with the kato scene
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,look at market and search katowice in the filter accordingly adjust prolly not much over
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the placement is rather bad but could be worse common stickers good fv id say go from like and adjust if you get no offers edit this might actually be a bit more but not too much is realistic id say
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im not im new the whole trading seen
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats not how this works its mw which is rarer for safari mesh kato souvenirs and there are very few of these there are only mw kato souvenir awp safari meshes with the wolf foil so with that math there are only of these and oh yeah no fn listed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks for giving me an approx i traded a st fn phobos for it id say i got good profit from it

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think the cheapest go for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,kara some keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,depends how much keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can get with gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,done
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ugly e
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,did you slice a smurf with this d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just like u p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,added you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nice price and good luck bro i used to own one similar and took me a while to sell so be patient
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,have a one with a good float how much can you pay
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if there are any issues with people breaking the rules then send it to modmail or report it dont have a spun out slapfight on here
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sure not on pc for a few days will do if i remember just informed him as he blocked me for absolutely no apparent reason
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,blue gem is so no
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there are no real blue gems on daggers but that one is not that bad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for both or one knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can be either so long as it totals afaik
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what would you say the total adds up to based on appearance
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you hid one of the knives behind the other so no idea
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,other play side is mostly gold
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sec ill histogram it for you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,alright
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you need an image with both play sides than just tell me though i doubt that itd make any difference
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,blue pixels of pixels per knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ah so its half close but no cigar thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,total or of one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so do you select all the blue on the knife or only on the blade above where its held
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,all the blue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,also is it on the entire knife or the main blade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,entire knife
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,alright thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,very last questions are gems once solid band of yellow or can they be splotchy ie does the status of the gem depend on the placement of the blue concisely or can it be the blood pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gem refers to the percentage of colour the price is determined by placement and colour
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,screens
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you are definitely asking too much if you have been trying to trade it for a month
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you telling that it is but actually it looking for a collector to buy this

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the price isnt good man i honestly think a better price would be ish goodluck xdddddddddddddddddd this market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,however these arent like expensive weapons does like counting market price really work ish like who would want a lot of these throwing them into a tradebot seems like the best option for you rn if you dont agree with such a low price i pray they offer you more a certain tradebot gives basilisks for each key so yeah d compared to your price they should be getting around basilisks for k ive helped with the maths xd

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no sorry im not interested in ch patterns
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,one post doesnt designate what its worth lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah bring me that april selling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,guess you are not that interested
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because these stickers quadrupled in price in months
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,show me anyone selling under keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i thought because you actually have the keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not worth the time i just know that a gun with a titan holo in the worst spot is still not worth lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay you can move on then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can offer you an awp asiimov ft goes for and a dsolate space bs goes for you can quicksell them for and
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,send offer p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,only a
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and he metjims
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,key skin with only a metjm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wat
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bo to low downvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats true ct fire power xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is not a single scratch on the stock holy mother of howl gl selling this beauty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do you not know what a howl looks like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whats wrong with that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn there is legit dink on the stock thats unlucky besides that it looks dope
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,facepalm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my had clean stock too so what
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is a small scratch lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,small scratch holo tho
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pls
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the fact that if youre selling a item that you should take a minute for proper screenshots hell its not even hd metjim rofl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its not all about float perfect example are karambits u can have kara with shit corner and u can have one with better corner so screenshots are really important when selling high tier items as low float clean scratches placement plays big role there
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,people dont realise how important it is to include screenshots in the post of any midhigh tier item its a huge sales tactic
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,alright it should have been a high quality metjm but still you can see all the scratches and so on so i dont really get why everyone hates it that much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,id argue that it really isnt for niche items where everyone knows what they look like
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,too true if you take the effort to make screens of your items you will stand out far more then the that just use a metjm these days
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no hate to him i wish him all the best in selling that dope ass gun its just it doesnt seem right just using a low quality metjim for a screenshot on such a nice gun

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ft is currently at on the market so you could probably list for max market or at least and you could probably get it theyre arguably the best gloves in decent wear so it might be worth advertising for a bit more than max market on trade servers seeing what kind of offers you get
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,agreed they look nice in game especially with a karambit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fyi sold in about an hour for max market

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes they r nice but imo gloves gone too far i mean they should not be like knives ever i would understand glove capsules like stickers or maximum red skins but not golden youre so lucky to get those and people r stupid to buy them for d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well kinda lucky buy order fun to use for a day and sell for profit agreed they are a waste of money but imo so are all skins

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ah i couldve done over your bo gl tho have a good one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you to mate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,key fn red lams
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fn howls sold on opskins yesterday all at drive down the prices so you can gobble up the panic sells gotta love market manipulation s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,saw a stat bayo uv ww on analyst saying keys cause of that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just a heads up think you mean red lam fns are capped at not
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i never see sapphires sell on market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i guess everyone who owns or deals with such rare items knows that its just a market manipulation attempt from august till now only fn red lams were sold of which in range of bucks item which is not sells daily risks to be under or overvaluted by anomalous market activity thats just it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,obvious manipulation of sites that go off analyst pricing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,analyst normally ignores these extreme low and high prices and therefore does not show the real market situation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gut knife scorched fn was another example seems like quite a few low selling rare items have that issue
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,who is using steam analyst anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold between and according to the market graph
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i actually never use analyst i just look at the graph steam market and reddit sales and see what the regular ones sell for so i dont look a those highlow spikes whichcan be really helpfull tbh i see a lot of new traders base their offers from analyst which can be a good thing sometimes but with stuff like this they just look like retards when they offer way below for what they normally go for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,huntsman vanilla dropped keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do you think people are working together like selling things really low at the same time and buying as many as possible right after that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks forgot the
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,check out the gut knife d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,some lowtier knives eg flip knife gut knife has sapphires and rubys selling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,normally but those rare skins only sell a few times in a month
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,some people uses to say also acepting items at sa prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its true but a lot of gambling and trade bot sites base their prices on stuff fromanalyst
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this people who only use analyst are full retards
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its totally possible especially with the contraband items they should theoretically continue rising in price as long as the market has a demand for those items this can easily lead to manipulation when theres a fixed amount of these items

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold the highest kara for is also for all knives was a blue steel hope this gives a reference
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,look sick
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how come the highest float knives are always blue steel and stained are all the other skins capped at
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah it looks litteraly sick like it has a disease or something
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to fade doppler marble fade tiger tooth gamma doppler to freehand to damascus steel bright water to lore to autotronic to stained blue steel case hardened black laminate to slaughter to urban masked scorched boreal forest forest ddpat safari mesh crimson web night vanilla ultraviolet to rust coat so basically you can get ultrahigh floats on stained blue steel case hardened rust coat and black laminate and indeed the highest floats are always stained blue steel or case hardened this is due to these skins are out for unboxing for much longer than the rust coat and black laminate im sure that in the future some knives with those finishes will be breaking into the top highest floats they just need time to be unboxed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why do yall treat mcskillet like a saint like i get hes well known and all but that doesnt mean hes a god at pcing stuff

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yours isnt a blue gem you have blue on bs p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that corner with that float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello uzuperino your post has been removed because world ranking lists are explicitly disallowed as they have more often than not been used in price manipulation you cannot state it is a pattern ch tier ch rank crimson web or best slaughter you can state that it has the best float on csgoexchange currently or worst float currently of csgoexchange with proof if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont click the link
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,life is hard sometimes still looks clean af ingame and corner isnt that bad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is it allowed to state that it has one of the best floats for this item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it made me hard
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whats the problem with the link i could not copy it and had to type it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ah fuck sry i misspelled it now it is fixed im really sorry needs to worry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you can prove it is the karambit gamma doppler you can include it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello ufloppehwalrus your post has been removed because your title is clickbait please make sure that your title is specific and you have not only stated keys or keys if you have any more questions concerning why your post was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe they think it means beat that ass
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,who cares about the bta shit max blue and max pink puts gun to own head
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and every fn orion is bta
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bta beaten up angle
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tbh better than average is an absolutely shit term what the fuck even is average of things are better than average
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its like you have to put true bta in the title for your post to stand out if you actually have a nice fucking corner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bta isnt really supposed to be used on describing corners it is more to describe the float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what does bta really mean in fact edit you already answered thx
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,every karambit has bta corner every is max blue every is max pink every and karambit gamma is max green welcome to rglobaloffensivetrade
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,a stands for average and the bt are just for style points seriously though im pretty sure people just think they can scrounge up a few extra keys by adding bta to it so it stands out in some way kind of like a way around the no clickbait rule
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its not about knowing its about sharking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but seriously wtf does it mean lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what the fuck is bta
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,looks are subjective right so bta is an opinion right s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am sure many know but they dont care they just want to sell their skins for higher priceit amazes me how many times i have found people that my knife should be keys under its steam market price even if it has good floatpattern etc but theirs is somehow magical and costs keys more than normal
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,httpacronymsthefreedictionarycombta found a site that must be commonly used by these bta traders
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha probably
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bta corner pink galaxy pooper poker mandingo milky way camel fucker pattern karambit doppler faze
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,look man i like my kara dopplers sexy but if it looks like someone had a car accident on the side of the skin i dont wanna buy it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah for sure especially if its st
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,very tru i agree thats why i think its fucking dumb
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah exactly at this point its just ridiculous
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bta fv is something different than bta corner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,all good man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the thing is it doesnt even stand out anymore kara doppler posts have bta corners
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fuck plebs probs look at shark tank for advice that show tho im asking keys for steam analyst in equity of our business lmao
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it is meant to be an acronym for better than average but if every corner it bta then it becomes the new average corners should mostly only recieve overpay like what has been asked for if it truely is bta mostly being a pixel corner where only one pixel is visible as a scratch on a metjm so yeah ik my shit when it comes to dopplers so it just annoys me when people ask more keys overpay for their max black bta corner karambit that often will look like someone has smacked it against a wall for minutes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,big titsass duh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,better than average or anything from this page on the internet according to the recent loungers that seem to have stumbled across reddit httpacronymsthefreedictionarycombta
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea thats tru to an extent but you see kara dopplers with extremely scratched corners and a fv claiming to be bta
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,british toilet association
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but then again maybe theyre posting it again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bta biological threat agent
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,agreed i do think too many people use bta in their titles im just saying that the issue with almost every single or being max blue or pink especially bad on bayos and is a worse issue xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahahahahah true tho almost every post with a karambit i see is bta but i dont know wtf it means
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,haha wtf

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bayo tt just saw one for and if youre looking for an ak get a st fuel injector or vulcan i think theyre around
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sounds good d always wanted a kara doppler tbh and i prefer over anyways thanks for the input
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,awesome thanks so much
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,np i have no knife but i have a dragon lore and it feels so unsatisfying qq
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can imagine should downgrade to a decent marble fade or something
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think at the point where even you call it an addiction would be good to stop
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,play more mm you will see so many idiots you will stop wanting to play the game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,addicted to skins that should tell you the answer any addiction is bad and should be controlled
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive tried weed cocaine molly schrooms and i find cs go skins the most addicting too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,throw your skins on a smurf for a week and play like that you will appreciate what you have x
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same mate ive spent on my moms credit card and my inv is only worth
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when i was addicted to gambling csgodouble i simply blocked the website i found that to be extremely helpful as every time i visited the site a notification popped up and i remembered the reason i blocked it in the first place but if you have a monthly income i think spending about of it on skins is reasonable as you can always resell them for at least of what you bought it for as to the money you spend on foodclothes etc is gone forever
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i cant lie you are addicted to csgo skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i found i got addicted to upgrading my items until i got to a kara fade with the excuse i was gonna use them for yt loadout vids i finally got sick of thinking about trading as i was spending money on virtual items that i could be using elsewhere if ur addicted to trading and want to stop just sell ur stuff on a cashout site if ur addicted but enjoy it and arent to worried about the money ur spending then just keep going if u are having fun sall good if not cash out and run its just pixels and its weird enough when people find out u spent that much on a video game skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i love getting skins as well and i put in more money than i would like to admit but i stopped adding money because i have a nice skin for every weapon i play i dont need a dlore fs or howl im happy with what i have which really makes me not feel the need to add money anymore
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,remove the mobile authenticator thing and your problem is solved by the time u can recieve your skin after days u will change your mind and reject the trade offer and get your money back
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,should i stop getting skins no you shouldnt investing in skins is smart
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same thing happened to me but i was and only worked hours a wk luckily my parents caught on and gave me a talk and although i cant say i hay ive entirely stopped i have saved up bucks since and the item im left with from my spending spree was a karambit fade so my advice is to do you you want to do you can stop at anytime you just need to realise the value of money and if you already have do what you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just suck it up and save money for a few months when you have enough just buy all the skins you want and forget about it no point having skins for the same weapon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive spent around pesos on skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,salute fellow money waster xd yup same story with me except ive spent a bit more grand and my inventory is worth grand i stopped wasting money when i got myself my dream skin karambit doppler black pearl but now i want to upgrade to a better pattern xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,selfcontrol think to yourself theyre just pixels on a game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey join the club
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im addicted but like any good addict ive figured out how to sell too so i dont need to spend any money lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same problem here spent like till now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,holy mother of jesus i just checked and i got this purchases items items value services items sold includes pending delivery count total sold total earned damn xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,httpsimgurcomabsyzn okeh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,id say selfdiscipline haha i am a trader and i trade so oftenly and all the high tiers to low tiers from kara sapp to like bucks stuff i wanted one ruby sapp serpent howl so badly but all i got for myself after like year is ump primal saber mw which i got days ago the first time after i think ever since im into trading world cant get the exact duration but it should be near to year haha and it aint moms credit card for this time bud xd eventho i make tons of profit i have a clear goal that i want to keep them for smtg even more useful saving for like buying gift have a great meal with someone you really care about for me i even bought myself a ducking expensive headphone beyerdynamic custom one pro plus whew so yeah even if u have a stable income i guess u must have strong determination or how about u just give all ur money to ur momma and let her keep in the bank hahahaha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think im in the same boat as you im also constantly thinking about what skins to buy next and even though ive spent over a thousand euros on skins i still buy skins almost every month in my opinion though if you dont spend more than you earn and at least save up a bit of money at the end of the month you should be in the clear regarding when to stop getting new skins ive made my own goal of completing my dream loadout and once that is done i most likely wont buy any more skins just set yourself a goal and clear rules for when you should stop buying skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think your missing something youve spend and cashed out and your current inventory value is so really youve only lost
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just stop thats what i did and vowed never to buy skins again only earn them by trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was in a similar spot i just sucked it up sold everything and the addiction pretty much just got better
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the thing is with skins its a hobby if you can afford it more power to you except if you cant afford that is when it start looking more like an addiction
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,where you check that account summary thingy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you are not alone ive purchased with around dollars and sold only around dollars
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont stop getting skins i just try to keep my play inventory and dont add more money variety doesnt have to be costly although ive certainly lost money on playskins so i set a bit of profits aside for that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i feel like if you budget your money in a way that doesnt threaten your rent food clothes etc you are okay if it is just blind spending and you are forced to do things for your basic needs you need to stop considering that you can cash out for of what you paid for means that you should be fine in the end just dont gamble trade or do anything to even have the chance to remotely lose the money you put in besides that you lose lol i am in a situation like you except i havent spent that much i just allow myself x amount per week on skins and if i dont spend that much i allow it to roll over and accumulate since i have a plan i consider myself okay good luck in the future
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its just pixels
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,stage skin insanity seek help immediately
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im in club too items sold includes pending delivery count total sold total earned
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do what makes you happy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i love skins aswell playing without skins or with is like going out with shitty clothes d and i normally wear good clothes so why not in csgo the positiv thing with skins is that u can resell or trade them so u cant loose all of ur money and i dont care for the wolders who say buy skill not skins those guys are just jealous idiots and im mostly better then them anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey i have the same problem qq d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have the same problem spent xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol wat
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold purchased feelsgoodman
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,learn how to trade that way you can upgrade without spending money on the game i went up from to almost inventory in less than months but i spent or something out of it soz p just learn to trade its fun and useful
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if youve got it fucking spend it you cant take it with you mate a friend of mine spent around £ on skins he doesnt trade has no intentions of trading he loves csgo he works he doesnt drinksmokedrugs so like to treat himself to nice skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,items sold includes pending delivery count total sold total earned purchases items items value services
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,words to live by
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whenever i solo queue i ask myself why do i have those skins if i am playing with those people
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,some people are so rude and mean to me just because i have skins its so sad yet funny xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,realtalk i saw tons of friends that were spending their monthly money that they got by their parents on skins sometimes even stealing money out of their pockets they eventually started fighting with other players ingame about why xyz is better because of his inventory value not cool
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to this guy dont end up using skins as a form of satisfaction
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,forgot the s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is a lot but i agree if you have enough money to buy everything you need to live and new clothes etc you can spend the rest of the money however you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i put in about
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,doesnt work anymore skins are now in your opskins inventory
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whats that like a cup of coffee in the freedom land
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea but its so shiny and i am not really successfull in my social life so i guess i use skins to compensate i think if i had friends i would spend money on clothes drugs and parties
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that dollar should come in handy though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,with the skins i sold i bought new skins i didnt cash out i only once cashed out
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but with the risk of making loss
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wouldnt recommend that to someone getting into an addiction
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,heroin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes but this is not real you can just walk away from it when you cant walk away naked in real life you need clothes to essentially live cold heat etc etc you dont need skins to do anything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pats shoulder welcome to the club homie
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,congrats and good job man this isnt the place though lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have a monthly income well probably working will net him a lot more money than trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if youve got it spend it is a horrible mentality to have when youre young from a long term financial standpoint your early earning years are the most important years in your life to be savinginvesting just sayin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how many times do u get the sell ur skins and skins but no skill
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sometimes you dont need it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats a pretty horrible thing to live by everyone when their young wants to become rich or achieve some dream but here in globaloffensivetrade as long as you can live just buy skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i put in far above
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah its like thousand cups of coffee
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think your better off spending money on skins then drugs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,jesus christ did you just come off of to shitpost stop wasting your money on pixels work on your social life drugs arent exclusive to a good party you realise alcohol is just fine festivals excluded edit maybe spend your money on worthwhile shit like a car clothes shoes escorts if youre beyond actually picking a woman up
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,follow your dreams
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u didnt understand me of course we dont need skins but we buy them because they are looking much better wearing expensive clothes just gives u a good feeling nobody needs clothes from a special or expensive designer when u get other stuff for far less money but we still try to get the more expensive stuff same with skinsu could play with the vanilla weapons but ppl buy skins it just gives u a better feeling when u can pull out a cool knife or shoot ur opponents with a sexy skin thats it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know but instead of wasting the money just spend hour or max trading daily and hes gonna get more than what he pours in monthly
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not really when i got my first job first pay packet spent it all on new computer then new monitor this went on for months i didnt have any bills to pay back then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,too often not to mention my mothers credit card or whoring to get money for my skins why cant people understand that there are working adults who choose to spend some of their earnings on pixels
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,seriously if he thinks he wants to spend from his own money let him spend it for fuck sake if he wants to buy a car let him buy it this is not a goddamn scientology where you get told what you have to do if he thinks he is addicted to skins he has to take action not up to us to tell him what to do in the end he needs to change it otherwise it wont work
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rip man i only put in every weeks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty close tho
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wouldnt exactly agree on that obviously all on regulated basis and not in an addictive pattern other than that certain drugs every once in a while are awesome im prepared for the shitstorm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well heroin will probably make you much happier than a shiny new karambit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i actually do browse so thats funny
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,so that means hours a month for the average trader im pretty sure working hours will net them way more than a low inventory inventory can get them in hours of trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youre assuming he has no bills nonetheless a computer isnt bound to one thing and its something physical skins in a game dont give you anything except something nice to look at in a game its like spending money on famous artwork but only having it digitally
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,working adults do not simply spend money on pixels
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well said xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fucking normies
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,please read what i said again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but when you do it consistently over two years that rounds up to a bit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,couldnt agree with you on any level who knows once he tries it once he could get addicted skins cashout site bank account drugs body no job no one likes you homeless
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can afford a decent car spends money on in game items for nerds niice one mate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahaha why not xd i think i am a yo brain in a yo body so you might be right d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you caught me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive only started to put money into csgo in july now im at a karambit damascus steel ww gonna trade it for bayo doppler
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,drugs body no job no one likes you homeless i love how you view drugs as an outstander who probably never touched any you dont just get addicted to drugs for doing them once and i never suggested taking heroin or whatever
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i used to trade a lot a year or so ago but since i now have all of the skins i want i only trade for fun every now and then
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yep trade for fun is risky can lose alot of money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i lost more money through the gambling thing than through one year of trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yep lost a gut doppler on roulette at the time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nonononono i didnt gamble i was referring to the price drop
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think i made some money in price drop

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont think anyone knows you guys who own the gloves set the price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i see one nice webbing on left hand gl thou try to get liquid item offers for it market is kinda slow for high tier stuffs
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well im pretty sure that the word emerald in it adds tons of value to it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,since all the gloves max out at and this skin is a mix of emerald and crimson web id hold on to these for a while unless you get a ridiculous offer could end up being pretty rare
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeh true might have to wait and see what offers i can get
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keep in mind that prices are going to drop right now the glove owners are the ones setting the prices so i would suggest to look at other gloves and think to yourself is mine worth more if so set a certain price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can do
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can co u if u send me the steam offer if no one bids above within some hours im likely gonna take ur offer

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,bit hard to get one with red stripe anyway interest awp with ibp on scope
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk if it is worth that much but even if it is it will be a lot harder to sell than ur flip phase
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea true i think ill pass its bs st tier stickered all in one that sounds so hard to sell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what a shitstorm haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,added for an offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well i would be interested but multiple vac bans on record seems to really be trustworthy sry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nothing can go wrong lmao its just a steam trade offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nothing can go wrong lmao its just a steam trade offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know i know but i just dont want to trade with someone who destroys the game for others thats my point
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youre judging me from bans ive had years ago
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am judging you from multiple bans i dont really care when u destroyed games for others thats your problem and not mine
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well your loss no awp for you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am totally fine with that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mmhm you keep thinking that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well dude i have a dlore on my main account as a playskin i think i can defintily be fine without your skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mmhm you keep thinking that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gl tho
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont think you mean it haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i did mean it however its up to you whether you believe it or not
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,co float is super bad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,whats the condition
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ft
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,aye sent ya one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,like usd over market because of position and its not all together
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ty
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youre gonna have a tough time finding someone with better mw float than that nice skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tbh the fnatic stickers are kinda ugly crown is bae though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i get wanting to lose the fnatic stickers but what are you planning to replace the crown with a bare dlore with a crown on the scope would look sick especially with that float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,jesus this will be hard check exchange
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,scratched it off yourself i see someone would have traded it and scratched them off anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you need to track down the fucking retard that put those fnatic stickers on it and sell them into sexslavery
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea i might just scratch all the fnatic stickers off and keep the crown
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just feel bad scratching off like in stickers but yea they are ugly asf
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i kinda just dont like it but yea i guess
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ill probs just scratch them but just putting it out there incase someone wants a crown foil and fnatic shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if he doesnt have the pass i think it wont worth paying more just to swap a skin
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,have you considered selling this one and using the keys to buy a new one gonna have some extra profit too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i actually quite like them haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ok yeah thats cool someone will enjoy it gl finding a lower or exact float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no i give for free
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah man ur right crown is kinda cool fuck the fnatics im doing what u said plus i looked it up its number best mw dlore sooooo no one really has a better one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,alright glad you came to a decision your choice at the end of the day

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lmao pls do your job and delete shitposts and not this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gotrade mods mothing u can do
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is nothing to discuss the video jumps from in game exploits that allow users to appear to have skins in game which have been around forever to generating actual items in their steam inventory which is not possible this youtuber misinterpreted the information in front of him and made a video about if there was something to be seen here i would be the first to upvote the post and investigate it personally
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ok thank you for your further explanation

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,co on my profile
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keep your titles relevant to what is being soldwhat you want to buy unnecessary attention grabbers will just lead to the removal of your post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think i only trade for playskins cause if i get a skin im not gonna enjoy using ingame i feel like its a waste
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i always trade for play skins too bad im so good at losing money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i currently only trade for playskins but only good playskins i overpay for nearly everything but the funny thing is i get the same offers back so technically i pay just the right amount and even get higher offers i also like to have unique skins for example i paid for a gamma and like days ago i sold it for the pattern was so sick and a float which is also really good so i just trade my skins to people who are actually using it instead of those guys who lowball you with on your dlore for example
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i also trade only for playskin but people like us are hard to find so when you have a fire n ice like i do now people offer market value for it saying its cancer knife since its stattrak well when the right buyer comes just like when i bought it they will buy it without hassle im always open for negotiation if i realize that the one whos trading with me is gonna use it as a playskin and not only trading for profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if i trade to get new skinsfor fun then i do it on trading sites for items under
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my main purpose was like yours somewhere around a month ago i invested and wanted to get the knife which i was looking for flip cw ft but then i got scammed keys lol in one rading web site where i did deposit items first before doing it after that i started trade to get the profit now i have around and it gets slowly worst and worst day by day prices increasing as fck you dont know what to buy sell
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was in similar position as u but after wrist injury i cant play cs anymore now i am trading almost only for money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i still trade for playskinsbut now i have only keys and the prices are to high and i wait to see a slightly price drop to buy some skins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same as you brother i really dont care about making profit or money when it comes to skins i just prefer to play with them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i trade for only playskins nowdays dont deal with liquids too much mostly stickeredblue gemsbta skins that i enjoy alot in game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i trade for skins that i like but also know i can resell later at a higher price usually stuff like vanillas dlores and such that are rising in price occasionally ill still do trades for profit if i see a nice offer but at least i dont go around lowballing everyone else
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if i see something cool and i have spare keys i buy it and i do try and sell it but for a high price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,to all ppl posted here why ru hiding everytime i decide to sell something
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i pretty much only trade for funplayskins since trading for profit is too much of a hassle and not worth the time of course i lost a fuckton of money because of that with all the up and downgrading over the time but i dont really care for me its the fun in getting new items that matters good to see that there are still people out there who prefer nice playskins over profit d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes but i noticed its a lot more now on the high tier end people who want to collect skins high tier katowices tend to buy skins for almost bo in my experience and not trade them even when they get a decent offer above bo its defo more rare on the lower tier end but it definitely exists
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i literally spent keys just so i could get a really nice inventory i dont regret it at all
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trading for crown loadout so no profit only love xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i trade like this and im making keys per days because im buying gloves for like keys week after the gloves price spike to and i insta sell it for keys thats how im doing both at the same time lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well i used to only stopped because i got the skins i wanted and dont want to change them now p how am i suppose to replace a howling dawn redline well with a st one i guess haha i remember one trade where i wanted to sell my playknife i had had for probly close to a year just wanted to change im actually back on that knife now lol and it didnt want to sell eventually i found guy that offered me keys less than what i paid for it i didnt mind loosing those keys since the way i looked at it was it cost me keys rent to have a nice knife for a year after the trade went through he a was like so how much u buy it for i bet u got it for xxx and made xxx keys off me didnt you the sorta quick fire lines at once message i told him i actually lost keys on it and as soon as i sent that he immediately unfriended me and blocked me i dunno what he was thinking if i want it back or something but it just seemed really odd to me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same i dont really trade for profit but my job isnt well payed
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,congratulation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,with that low of a fade mediocre float value youre going to struggle to get market most likely good luck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe tradebot
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk anything about tradebots that was literally my first trade haha if i got a shitty end of the deal its cool i was just curious
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk really if ya did but tradebots just make it easy to trade a hard selling knife usually offer decent
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,good price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hope you find a retard who sell you his crown d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well why retarded for current market it is a ok price i dont pay lounge just because they may double in price in the future and i dont like to put my money in a buy order right now on the market or some overpowered website i just prefer to pay in keys and me and few others got crowns for in the last week but thanks for the wishes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what did u mean price is ok
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dunno why hed be a retard if full price is keys and hes paying
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,full price is isnt it also crowns have always sold for full market price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know should have put that into quotation marks several guys tried to sell their items to me at because prices will rise
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you cannot get capsules in a drop im wrong
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,actually you can just dropped one on my game i didnt know it too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wow youre on something anyway i dont really know how long have you been trading but you certainly do not know the history crowns have been selling for full market price in keys when they were like keys then they went on to keys which was still quite a while before the hype but still they did use to sell for full market price in keys you may think of it as buyers are foolish or anything but even in the current market i sold a crown for keys now about the market part not everyone can put money in wallets also it is usually futile to spend real money when you can buy just buy stuff for keys and then there is the day thing ofcourse just because people like to buy stuff for cheaper does not mean that people who have that stuff would sell it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,shit just checked wiki and yeah you can now i took a month break recently so they mustve changed that then sorry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,last para made no sense to me if we sell keys on market we get of market price which makes crowns cost more than they are on market and its a tedious process also you dont really know how long you have to wait before someone puts up a crown at your buyorder price as for the last para no one makes a discussion like i dont sell for current market price thatd be spamming this sub feel free to check the history of this sub for crown prices and their respective market prices at those times you dont have to like my comment or anything but atleast know how things have been
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nice price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,was buying crowns for yesterday shoudl be able to sell fast

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it has to be fade though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fades arent my strongest point but a fv with a worse corner is going for and a is so maybe depending on buyer

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i sent offer for his bo rip man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,already sold for bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,accepted thanks man
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,price is super fucking great i was going to buy it and apply a crown on it but i really dont want to have a flip knife as my only playknife ive searched for mp for the past weeks and yours is by far the cheapest one so dont negotiate your bo as its already super great
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rip its ok haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just looked at that inv nice collection
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,interested in a st ft wasteland with crown on wood
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks mate my only concern is that i have a fucking ft mp hence why id like to buy yours anyways im at work rn so ill think about it you might receive an offer from me in a while i just have to find the balls to do another craft
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,btw what you just did editing the bo and put it keys higher breaks the rule of this sub reddit buyouts are required to be honored not accepting an offer for buyout and sending an offer for over buyout are both not permitted offers sent for buyout after hours are not required to be honored if there is an error in a buyout message modmail before doing anything please either delete this post and contact the mods for aproval or put it back at keys otherwise ill have to report you to modmail
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,u were close cuz i am searching st serpent with crown
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the buyouts are required to be honored is only if someone sends for the bo and you decline no one sent for bo and i did more searching for master pieces and this is still a fair price is that how it is or am i just misunderstanding the rules
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this would be good for the time being d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you are missunderstanding the rules completely it says there on the rule if there is an error in a buyout message modmail before doing anything meaning you cant edit a buyout unless the mods aproved so right now if i send an offer for keys you no longer have to accept it because you changed your bo which is stupid because once you post the bo must be honored for hours like it also says on the rule what you did straight bypassed the rule and its also breaking it as you didnt have aproval from the mods like i said contact them before making any changes keys doesnt worth risking a ban imho nothing personal i wont even buy that mp now nor at or but rules are rules
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ight thanks for the heads up homie thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,np also forget what i said about deleting the post as that also would count as doing something withouth the mods aproval contact them and if nobody sends keys in between now and the mods response then youll probably get aproved by them also really this isnt something personal but the point is that you have to find out the price of your items before you post them once you do for hs you have to honor your bo next time if youre unsure about the price of an item better put it higher and not get sold for bo than cheaper and lose a couple keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you must now specify key prices in the section when selling
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i remember when i offered you around a couple weeks ago loll
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,is it really a quicksell with these prices now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sure
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent an offer d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,remove ur co im pass
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmm not trying to be picky here but i prefer pure keys cuz dont really have the time to resell the karambit school starts again soon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh okay
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you can manage to get a gamma i will consider xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why just downgrade with overpay for the gamma d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,win win for both of us d hehe
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not really lol i lose keys in that case
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,downgrade with overpay
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not rveryone is willing yo do that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,blue steel ft
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,kinda close to a flip tt
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well thats my recommendation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as a gamma owner i have to say this price hurts my eyes cuz its so low but so you should be able to sell it pretty fast d gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hello your post has been removed because it is considered clickbait to just put keys any ak skin you must make sure that your title reflects your bo and your entire trade you must state what item you are looking for and how much you will pay in the title read post for more information if you have any more questions concerning why your postcomment was removed feel free to reply to this comment
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty sure just typing keys in the title is moderated as clickbait and could get the post removed best of luck

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im saying what i think its worth sorry if you thought your item was special and ended up not being what you thought if you think you can get banned for saying that why dont you just shut up theres no reason to insult anyone you created a thread asking what your item was worth i answered it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you gave me no idea of the pricing and the only reason i thought i would be banned is cause you seem rogue so please leave me alone so i can get a proper pricing
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,plus if you actually read my thread it says its my friends so its not my item so maybe read the thread before commenting also

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no thanks man sorry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well maybe u just use the search function once there u find several karambit gamma doppler with their prices
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,happens to all of us most people either dont look them or dont know the price of it is what id assume no answer is better than a false one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i usually upvote price checks when i cant help in any other way at least i give them more visibility p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what skin are you posting
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same ive posted a dozen of price checks and multiples of a knife i currently have all ignored
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont know about the others but if you write urgent in the post title i will automatically ignore your post and not even try to help by making that are trying to make it seems like your post is more important than others and that is not right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well there arent much precedence in terms of sales and im not sure how much to price the knife considering someones selling it for super cheap compared to others but still no takers and i was offered one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wrong but why should someone respond when op is just too lazy to search for the price not even that hard to find it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,karambit gamma
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well start high if u wont get any offers lower it a bit step by step u could even compare it to the prices they sell for on opskins come on guys if u want to trade u have to use your brain at least a bit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its not always the easiest to find certain patterns ect sometimes the price is old and prices can change fast
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you know you can message a mod or someone directly about price checks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well nothing will happen if u start high and lower it after u wont get any offers and if u want to sell it fast check prices on opskins or sth like that
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i read somewhere on this subreddit that you shouldnt message mods for useless stuff or else you might get banned

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sent bo for flip sap
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not sure if i already asked you but would you be interested in a httpimgurcomacyzga
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lowest price you can do
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,everything else hurts
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah im alright lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,why lol i think thats a pretty reasonable price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont think small details hinder the bigger picture im just not interested in the price sorry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but you could say something different than lol to a price doesnt feel good you know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i understand that and im sorry but i just couldnt take you seriously if your lowest was higher than anything you offered to other people
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yep thats because i offered on other items there then i go lower not if i ask generally
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how to unbox souvenir st fn awp dragon lore with scar pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nice find dude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,all them gold achievement medalsbadges
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can you actually open it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this wasnt fixed already found that years ago
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nice proof
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you mean cheated achievements d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i dont know i can give a key to my alt account and try it if you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you can but itll say unable to retrieve item
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what its there
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that was what i exactly meant xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you dont need to cheat to get all golds there are workshop maps for the stupid ones like arms race games i know because i did them all and used the maps for the arms race ones
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,looks weird
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it doesnt take the key btw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,anyway you didnt get them in fair way so it doesnt change anything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn service medal but only mm wins grinding dat dm
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,rip key
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,pretty interesting tbh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the only one i used was the rescue hostages or whatever because i despise hostage maps
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how does it not change anything there is no way someone is going to sit and play arms race times to get a medal cheating is giving them to yourself instantly not finding a way around valves ridiculous expectations
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i earned most of it last year quite the opposite actually xp i mostly just trade these days
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you still didnt get them in way that was expected from creators giving them to yourself or spending mins on some custom map when the real way of getting them is only through giving some real dedication see no difference
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,may i ask how you got that amazing looking font
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the way the creators wanted you to get them was dumb though of people play cs for comp not to play of hours of arms race plus its not like they actually affect anything other than people saying you cheated for them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,banana gaming has a mod vac safe ive been using it on and off for like months now that he either endorses or created himself that can change the font in game simple if you follow the instructions to a t edit here the link x httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmxgshejkns

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have an offer for in my trades
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,afaik the float is really hard to find on karambit slaughters and the diamond pattern is desired so id say its a good deal if u want not an slaughter expert tho just my cents
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,its likely not profitable but i think its as cheap as it gets right nowp if you only care about the float and not about the corner then yeah its not bad id go for a clean corner myself if i was after playskins you can try go haggle since the demand for these is very low but as i said in your last thread i expect it to take at least
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think you could do better for but im not updated on slaughters atm but that corner is ehhhhhh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,slaughter patterns are a bitch to sell i personally wouldnt do it

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,act like a mod not like an idiot please
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and everyone with this karambit advertises it as pixel so im not false advertising
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,such price speculation is prohibited
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just look of prices of items that are on market one mont ago cheapest kara doppler was arround usd now and this is with every single skin all grow up and it will be unfair if low tier items grow up in price and high tier dont
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,probably market manipulation every single dlore was bought off of opskins a few weeks back probably a trade site manipulating market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trade bots overvaluing the everliving tits out of them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,people invested in them trade sites bought alot of them and there isnt an operation since a long time
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cobblestone collection doesn´t drop since last operation so the prices for it go up because the supply of the items is not filled up by ingame drops
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,chooo chooo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,csshitmoney
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,case sites buying dragon lores and certain tradesites overpricing them theyre gonna go back to where they used to be
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the answer is simple weeks ago i wanted to buy myself a fn dlore they were still keys as soon as i told myself nah lets stick with keys the dlores heard me and decided to fkin spike up keys ffs thanks yes im mad as fuck okay çç now idk why but it feels so wrong to buy skins that were keys less just a few weeks backfeels like im wasting money idk eventho this is not true at all but meh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and case sites restocking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cobblestone collection could be dropped in the last operation however it is unknown that they are still obtainable in the next operation
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats what i said cobblestone collection does not drop since last operation xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ow shhhhhh that hurts im mad af because everytime i change my mind about a trade it turns out it was something i would have greatly profited from and also i really wanted a dlore to play for a while shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i thought u said cobblestone cant be dropped in last operation xdd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,since
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but it feels so wrong that i could have had one for keys and now id have to invest of them for a lets say i know the ratio is still the same but idkjust kinda scared c same as sapphires had a closetopixel corner sapphire and sold for around around one month ago i guess its worth now these high tiers scare the hell outta me i always try to flip them as fast as possible because its a lot of money into one single item and you know im trying not to lose a single key p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh yeah will have a good look at items then thanks buddy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,fuck dont have keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well do comeback if u change ur mind though when u do i might buy it for much cheaper price because that buyers gonna be out
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im not interested in lowball offers when u do i might buy it for much cheaper price xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well buyers might change and i usually pay lower price for those who comeback after quite a while p its yea i guess u could put it as lowball d if ud trade now i can go for max the buyer wont change his mind
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my bayo for your knife and some adds
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do you have some ss and the fv

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,glock fade titan k
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay gl
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys is of all but if they are together its worth more like ibp holo is like keys each but if its its keys something so its probably more than
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn this glock is sick sad that the stickers are scratched gl in getting a pc
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i ssed this glock a loooong time ago httpimgurcomajnnuw it looks amazing in game id say to count it as really depends on how much the buyer cares about them being scratched once imo even tho in game you cant even notice it at least i didnt until the owner told me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,did you read the part that all of them slightly scratched
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ye but still above i think you can even get more if you dont mention the scratches because you cant like even see them
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk about you but i would be pretty mad if i bought item and only then noticed that stickers are scratched so not mentioning is bad idea
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah but i dont think people care if its so small you need to look closely to see but yeah still above p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,people who buys stickered items cares a lot trust me ps im not saying its worth less than just i dont think that much more if any
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ye i own a reason holo glock bluefissure myself i wouldnt care
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,collectors cares no discussion about it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im open to negotiation if your interested im looking for offers
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but it has a lot of red i mean its full red im not expert in kinomo gloves but im sure its make a lot of sense right now gloves like this listed for in steam soo guess op price isnt that bad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,this price is way to high for battle scarred tbh doesnt matter if it has that much red there are more than just one max red patterns for crimson kimono
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would buy that dig ak if it wasnt stattrak looks super nice
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have this ak for httpimgurcomrisojao

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn my first ever drop from the major was a cobblestone i got while eating cereal haha sold that and bought some cache packages
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn dude worth it though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i got an overpass drop in the round on overpass this major so i could sell if for a quick dollars instead of
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,damn i might be opening up about more mirage cache ones on my stream thurs possibly i have no idea though theyre addicting but can be super bait i saw cerb go by and blues in a row go by
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i almost got a radiation hazard but thank god i didnt get that but instead got this beautiful underrated gun s
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youll get something good soon i promise i forgot to put in post i opened one case and got a fuel injector mw just before the souvenir cerb shitt
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am not planning to open any cases any time soon my inventory is worth about rn and not really looking to invest more as of now and opening case is also lame haha
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know the feel i just remembered i opened a rust coat bs and i kinda wanna hunt it down it was in though any idea on how to hunt that shit down lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no clue reddit might know tho
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no thanks and the price is ridiculously high already sold the asiimovs anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just because someone say its worth x it doesnt mean it is he said and you cant even sell it for keys that should tell you something edit even lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thats how any market in the world works if people arent willing to pay for it then thats not what its worth items are worth what people are willing to pay for them anyway im not interested in the item thanks anyway
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for reason for vox for vp for clan so personaly i would only add keys or so but its all depends on buyers view so i would say this would be a low number for it also i have no idea on whats ak worth or if its worth more for the ch effect this is only the katos on the skin and how it looks

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hey uroomll you are posting here too often we currently allow sale posts per day you can read the rules here httpswwwredditcomrglobaloffensivetradewikirules you may post again in hours and minutes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tell him that you will go fest men
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,how old are you if youre that young that ure father is able to tell u what ure able to buy and what not and u also have to tell him what ure buying and what not hes probably right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you already have a inventory im not really understanding why you want to dump another into it when you already have a decent platform to trade upon
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont spent too much just tell your dad only buy keys and start trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tel him u can resell it and make money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,find a compromise with your dad dont spend all your hard earned money on keys start out slow instead make a small investment of keys what i started with and start trading first of all trading in lower tier will learn you the lessons of trading and make you work even harder for profits harder to gain more in lower tier than higher tier plus in case you are making mistakes you will not lose as much as if you were heavily invested is it for trading or playskins
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if you really want it that badly tell him how hard you have worked the past few months and would really like to reward your self and enjoy some of it especially since this seems like your own hobby also explain to him that you will be able to get most of the money back at any time if needed hopefully hes an understanding guy and will at least try to reason with you also try to wait until hes in a good mood before asking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont waste money your dad is right
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tell him you want sa and looking for profit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if he deems you old enough to go out and earn your own money then he should deem you old enough to spend your own money he may not think its a wise decision but he should let you do your own thing and makes your own successes or mistakes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just lay out a plan for what you want to do and how you can trade to potentially make profit in general trading does teach a few life skills including communication and risk assessment if you just want playskins it gets harder but you could show him how the markets been going up and that everything you buy can be resold so you can treat it as a short term investment overall it depends on how old you are where youre from and youyour parents financial status and upbringing but if you lay out evidence pointing towards there being little risk of financial loss most parents would comply
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if its ur money u have to right to spend it dont you oo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tell him it is investing and that you will make money in the long run hopefully
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,first i would really think about whether or not its best to spend that money on pixels then if you decide thats the best plan for your money i would talk to him about how its like an investment compare skins to stocks and maybe show him how people have turned small investments into huge profits even if thats not what you plan on doing if its still a no then just save that money for another time and get back to the trading grind d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,show him opskins and some articles about how people earned alot money by trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,do you have your money or does your dad have it im and ive never had that problem
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,idk maybe man up open a bank account and do it anyways its your money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ask ur mom lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,stop being a kid helps
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,traded for it all im bored of trading now so i want to buy to get the rest of what i want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ive been trading to my inv which is like or keys or something now im bored of trading and now i hate it and just want to buy the rest
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,already traded to a or key inventory and im bored of it good idea with telling him that though im btw
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well thats what i think not him though lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,but yeah dont use all your money on skins trade instead
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,what do you mean i have it in my bank account and i earned it from working
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol thats the worst possible idea
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,gud meme spoiler warning the answer is ask your dad cunt
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and your father has to allow you what u wanna buy with ur own money where are u from
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i mean if youre really into skins and stuff then by all means with the kind of garbage money i was making at your age i wouldnt have spent that much on pixels lol let your father know that you can get roughly of what you spent back if you really needed money for some reasons and the prices remained stagnant i understand why he doesnt want you to do it though theres definitely better things that can be done with the limited amount of money you can pull at your age
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and its for playskins cuz ive been trading d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,or
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just put into steam by steam card and started traded till now
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,then how can he stop you if its in your account just buy whatever you want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,not really lol tell him youre not
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahhahahahah at least we have the same problem
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,british columbia canada why
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea all i really do is play games mostly cs and school but lets just say i wont even be spending half of the money i have left right now not even a quarter of what ive made
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ahh sorry i didnt really do any background check on you imho keep trading seems like you are good at it if your dad is not into computer games and even if he is then the trading scene can still be quite tough to understand trying to convince him wont be easy but you could try and sit down with him and explain how everything works and if you want further respect explain that there is a certain risk the items will lose value show that you understand the proscons and teach it to him how old are you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,him and my mom monitor it and if i buy something without telling them they will see it and get really angry
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just corious thats hard bro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dude tell them its your money i dont know how much your parents influence what you do but here in australia anyone is allowed to spend their on money on what they want
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i completely understand you what i have mentioned is how i would have dealt with it today however when i was that is probably not the way it would go p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,or just show them how much people have made through trading maybe show them he subreddit or some large inventories
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,trust me ive tried and dont take this wrong it isnt a canada thing or anything just my parents
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yea not really what i was thinking i thought of transferring my money to paypal but they monitor my bank account lmao thats why i came to reddit ill talk to him when hes in a good mood
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont go behind their back it will not work in the long term i wish you good luck if you need some more help or anyone to chat with just add me

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,httpimgurcomaqmsla for ak
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,add me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ty but but ive seen in keys and goldgem and knife virtually worthless nowadays i will refuse
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just sold the knife for but ok
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lucker
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for my ak
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,youve reached the peak that happens to most ambitious people in life they strive for a goal reach it but its never enough to satisfy them youll eventually find another goal whether its in this game or in another gratz on being successful
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,it wasnt about pleasure it was all about the dollar that should be the driving point to continue if your still turning a profit losing on a trade is annoying and can put you off too many selling sites and info sites around these days making trading hard tbh
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i felt the same half year ago had been trading for about years and loved it but it just started to get boring and i realized that real life items are worth alot more to me than csgo items so i cashed out most of my stuff and bought alot of shit for my self and for my friends and family now mounths later i find myself missing the good old days of looking for trades on reddit and trade servers i really do miss trading and i have set a goal for my self in to start trading again and see if i some how can manage to get back to where i were before i quit and cashed out anyways i think all you prob would need is a break cash out some skins buy ur self something nice and check back on reddit after a couple mounts maybe you will find a way to get into trading again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,take me under your wings man show me your ways lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i feel you bro even though i only have an inventory of a measly flip lore and a year of my life to trade steam trading cards to this knife its getting kinda boring since everything is like in a stalemate
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,take on an apprentice if you like find someone willing right here matey and show them what youve done how you did it and how they could use your methods for good for some reason passing on your skills to someone is a very pleasing thing to do and might bring you some enjoyment c
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i got into the same boat i decided to start crafting stuff i guess lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,set a goal for some irl stuff not some stupid items and get itrinse and repeat
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,the question is can you get to a knife from about keys i only have xdd if yes make me your student senpai
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i can feel you always wanted to have a sapph traded so hard till i got it and was getting bored after a day kept trading but never was the same cashed out now several times and always trying to set a new goal i guess thats the only thing keeping me stuck to trading for example i traded till i got a uvmwlvcollection from or sth like this i mean i love the game the possibility to make have fun in trading sometimes to gift a friend its an amazing combination im just getting annoyed nowadys with the no vanillakey bullshit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,after reaching ur dream knives their isnt much to trading youve already reached ur goalpeak but wont enjoy it any further
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as i say always if you want to enjoy with your life or enjoy with the stuff that you do never reach your goals
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was in the same place where i had karambit sapphire emerald faviour bayonets and basically all the other knives skins aswell my advice for you is try to find yourself a lower tiered knife with a really rare skin such as fade with low float that you enjoy very much basically back to the roots atleast thats what helped me bro
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,imma add you on steam milfslayer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i feel the same dude my goal was to get myself a howl dlore and a nice knife finally got that months ago and now im going to quit trading because its just a waste of my time that i can spend on other things in life or a small job which earns even more then trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,same lost all motivation to trade about half a year ago obtained fn howl sold it when the got nerfed made around keys profit was so stupid why would i trade for a mere profit for contraband anyways in the midst of all this there were too many gambling sites market prices were unstable and valve screwed us over a bit with the fact that we cant trade items we buy for a week then after the shutdown of many gambling sites my inventory crashed around and literally made me lose hope in trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just do it because its a good way to make money and interact with others
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,quit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,add me if you want i can help out with anything
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i just think of it as something that i could get extra income just in case i needed the money badly

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,shit happens trade servers are slowly dying and thats where you here nothing but keys quicksells people dont know how to trade and make profit so they have to resort to that might as well let it be because it doesnt seem like its going away

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,had a float bought it for was a struggle for the buyer to get i cant tell u how much the matters but it does for sure u have to know a guy wich is crafting one of those for him its a lot worth ofc
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,holy fuck shit this is dope asf cant believe its not even xd gl with pc sure its worth a tonne to crafters
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i would say but im new to trading
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just saying but if you dont know what youre talking about when it comes to price checks dont say anything im not trying to be rude but youre not helping by giving false info
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,are getting sold for easy so its way off
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah def way off would go over imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,just curious where u got it from o
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,advice taken my apologies
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,that would be great but i would like to hear multiple answers so i can get a better picture
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well i did say i am new to this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if i tell you ill have to kill you
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah was just letting you know wasnt tryin to be rude
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,if youre new to trading its probably best to not pricecheck items especially if you have little to no knowledge about the item in question
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,okay fam i think ill back the fuck off o
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,can you tell me and then you can kill me thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,no worries no offense was taken since you seem to know your way arround trading can you give me your opinion on how much would this awp go for
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i took it from a trading bot i was lucky i was fast and i was first
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,im sure this was posted on my pc thread front page on reddit but i closed it a few hours ago and id say
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dun kill me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i didnt post it but thanks for your answer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sorry typo should say float
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,somewhere between pure keys upwards of in items
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,max
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,sold my with foils over market market price full or over
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,get a job honestly thats not even sarcasm i got a job a few months ago after trading for over a year and no amount of low tier trading compares to the paychecks you get even working minimum wage hours a week especially since you say you cant make money trading if thats not the issues you already have a job etc you need to know how the market works what skins are inflated at the moment which skins are in a dip and watch the new page of reddit as much as possible to find good deals i saw a flip mf earler go for sa sold instantly that would have been keys profit in probably one to two hours also having a pretty nice at least keys starting wallet for trading helps a lot edit also if your price isnt shit stay firm on it youll get sooo many people offering below your bo sometimes even ridiculous qs prices just stay firm and youll find someone who actually likes the skin isnt just sending mass offers to try and make a quick buck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,buy cheaper
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,dont buy just to buy wait for a good deal and dont sell before u got atleast key profit p
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,takes money to make money
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,raise bo to something ridicolous you always get offers below that so maybe the actual bo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thanks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,holy shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keys keys
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,xddddddddd you do this on every post like this get over it we get it most people buy red lines in bulk
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and people who are buying bulk are still paying keys i can link multiple posts from this subreddit in case you didnt know
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah yeah i know some people pay each no bulk but since halloween sale most people have bought in bulk
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for vulcans
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,my question is how have you had this for so long
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,csgo skins added with arm deals update so years ago
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i bought it directly from the guy who unboxed it years ago as of now it can be misunderstood with you bought it years ago from the guy who unboxed it remove the and its perfect
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,wtf is this shit i tried to sell mine for pure and got down voted other week xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i see ak blue gem i upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,like why is scar pattern so expensive i see other blue gem aks with kinda same look going for of the price sometimes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,maybe i am a noob but why is this worth i must be missing something important
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,ye youre right i dont know skins for shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i added all owners of scar ft i wish you luck selling your scar but please double check before you make statements like this it concerns me when i see someone say theyve added all the owners but i am still left out somehow dont take it the wrong way but its just that it can be misleading to traders who want to buy a scar again best of luck with your sale and great price too
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and i dont think this disclaimers i added all owners of scar ft before i could buy that one no one selling for cheaper even worse float ones gl geting one cheaper than this one is true cuz ive been offered for less recently
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was wonder how long takes to sell one higher tier like that i have one ak ch aroundn and it takes while to sell imagine one higher ch like that anyway nice sample upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,tbh the scar is a bit less visible than some others i think i dont know if thatll affect the price
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i did not i bougth thats some weeks ago from the guy who unboxed it years ago im the second owner
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you are right edited
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,indeed tks
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i was offering pure weeks ago no one even considered my offer
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,first of all this pattern is considered and by far as the best pattern for ak case hardened full blue back almost full blue top yellow on a scar which is easily covered by stickers if needed second of all its super rare to get it as there is chance to get it and finally rare and beautifull ak case hardened are considered some one of the best looking if not the bests skins in csgo in a term of very high tier speaking
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cuz its some dank ass shit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,personally i think its overrated but its the arguable the best and most sought after ak for collectors its the best ch pattern and theres very limited supply i think theres only fn ones the case is very expensive to open and then the probability of getting one is v low which really restricts supply
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,because its overrated and peeps pay this price edit ooooh downvote me harder baby
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,inspect a random ak ch on the market and then this one the amount of blue on this one makes it this expensive this one has the best possible pattern its the best of the best
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i have to admit i added almost all you are right i was getting a bit out of energy since no one wanted to trade to me so i might have missed some private profiles or so i will edit it
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i suppose you posted dat as an offer im not interested in it anyways
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,and i remember offering for your mw or with dig holo on front like a year ago xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,nah man its same pattern for all of the scar ak whith the pattern index maybe its due to the condition of it on fn it shows really brigth and on bs on the other hand could be more visible indeed idk xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,oh my bad awesome skin upvoted
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,where were you when i needed u bro gl selling though
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,you were offering when you had one already
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you for this detailed answer d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,turn shaders on low and ch become one of the ugliest skins in the game
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well said would read again
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,as far as anyone knows all ak ch patterns have the same rarity
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,exactly why you still think its overrated then xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,lol r u mad
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,he isnt talking abt fire serpent xd which is overated af d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i know the feeling ive had some experiences where i did make sure to add everyone but somehow still miss some people i think youre right about the private profiles thing some items are probably hiding until after you make the post
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yes
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahah that is true i sold that ak for around in items i cashed out that time in order to buy furniture for my new apt now i backed on trade life xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i think its probably cause of your viewmodel
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you buddy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,thank you i got downvoted when i was offering this
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i got this one weeks ago but not from my offer on reddit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hahaha was just about to say
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,when you have very few blue in it yes on this pattern it looks really fine xd
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,there is other patterns less blue than this one
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,for me its the cost unless you have the moneyare looking to be flashy there really isnt that much of a different going for the pattern at a much lower cost plus in general the hype around them is little outside of traders my bro has had a few of them only for trading purposes and though they look nice unless you have the money to spare you could get so much more bang for your buck
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,mad of course not just dont think case hardened looks good
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cade hardened has always been overrated are you joking lol
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,d
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,well yes it could be
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,me
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,second of all its super rare to get it as there is chance to get it anyevery gold gem also has a unboxing chance the overall supply is exactly the same as the other chs the demand is just much higher it is no more or less rare than any other pattern
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i use low shaders c

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,keep the mlg capsules or sell all and buy from cologne what do yo think my friends
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,first time investor what would you guys recommend i was thinking faze well known brand and sk because it looks best imo
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i am prepared with accounts containing in steam wallet ayy
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,i got cbble drops should i sell them and buy stickers or keep them

GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,anyone remembers how long it lasts
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cant buy holofoils stickers not capsules ingame have to buy from market
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,did the sale end
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,hmm buy now or later in sale prices have dropped a lot but will they drop further
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,have to spare can anyone suggest something kinda new to the trading thing so might not get some references
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,invested euro x
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,most likely you will get a minimum of profit but imo those stickers are way better than any previous cologne so could be very ez profit in the end anyway you lose nothing so not buying is not an option
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,cologne didnt went up in price last year because the foils and non foils look like dogshit
GlobalOffensiveTrade,not_removed,yeah i bought stickers for like euros last year at cologne and they didnt rise almost at all
