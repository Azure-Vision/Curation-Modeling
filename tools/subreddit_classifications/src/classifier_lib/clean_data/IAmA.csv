IAmA,removed,thanks for doing this ama after korra finished reddit was so on fire and happy about your ending it was insane i may get down voted to oblivion but i have to tell you your ending was a joke it was a total cop out it was like you ran out of time and decided you know whatim going to use this show that i have spent so many years developing a following as a soap box to say one last thing to ruffle some feathers you chose to make her a lesbian were you on crack regardless of what people believe and if it is right or wrong that was terrible writing there was no build up there was no happy ever after it was oh by the way shes a lesbian because we ran out of time on to morality i cant even let my children watch this show now because i know what you stand for you dont fear god so you think you can do what ever you want with no consequences thank you for ruining an almost great show by giving us the middle finger you planted terrible seeds in childrens minds how could you do something so bad matthew at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who then is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven he called a little child to him and placed the child among them and he said truly i tell you unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven therefore whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me if anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble such things must come but woe to the person through whom they come

IAmA,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

IAmA,removed,this explains the nba app
IAmA,removed,nice
IAmA,removed,theres a great resource for learning how to program in rlearnprogramming you generally want to start out not just learning a language right away but httpsocwmiteducoursesintroprogramming modern languages basically all have the same basic functions youre just going to have different syntax quirks strengths and advantages for each language after you learn how data types functionsmethods decision structures loop object oriented programming etc you want to start playing around a bit with a language all languages start out roughly the same i could have knowledge in c but still understand it if i have a foundation of basic programming its just a framework or library behind it that starts to complicate things there are many other choices but to make it easier on you programming can be generally divided into these tracks front end web back end web mobile apps software apps web development isnt just all hey im going to change how this website looks thats one component of web development but thats just the tip of the iceburg theres code that runs behind the interface that lets us do a whole lot of stuff and the majority of web development is that front end focuses on the clientside or what you see on your browser so basically the web page design user experience the logic and algorithms that go behind making a website do cool stuff etc for languages in front end development you generally want to at least know extemely easy to learn not a language but its fun same thing with html javascript learn the base language first dont worry about the frameworks that are associated with it theyll come to you naturally once you get going on it back end focuses more on the serverside or the processes that happen in the servers like database management linking the servers with the browsers etc for languages in backend you generally have python a lot of people like starting with python for back end java java hype has died down a lot but theres still place hiring for them and its flexible with other types of development ruby on rails honestly dont know much but its popular aspnetc microsoft oriented people still use these php people hate php but its easy to learn its being phased out though theres some people that do both that are called full stacks development but honestly it requires a tremendous amount of work and your personal time to keep up with the hottest framework and hype just to stay relevant in one aspect of web development so i wouldnt recommend unless youre amazing mobileios development is pretty straightforward you still have the front end back end principle like web dev but youre generally going to be working in a different programming environment theres a lot of other things to consider with what type of application are you building and etc you generally are going to focus on either building for ios or android languages for mobile development can be swift for ios java both corona sdk more for android etc and then you have the straight software development and other niches straight software development is just going to be developing software and games and what not i say that but thats just generalizing a whole ecosystem of programs and applications languages can include java its old but still widely used c its old but still widely used python people like python c used for more microsoft tech etc as for getting a job in the it industry thats a whole different level jobs in the it industry is generally divided by development and operations development is more of the programming side operation is more of the networkingdba management side getting into the operations side isnt hard all you need is a couple of certifications from some vendors and you can do basic entry level operations jobs certifications can be from httpatglearningcomglobalwpcontentuploadscomptiacareerroadmapatgjpg if you have any basic knowledge of computers you can probably pass the comptia a test and get a job as a help desk if you brush up on some studying material cisco itil etc as for the software development side things are a bit more harder programming generally doesnt have a hard requirement for education as long as you can prove you know your stuff and have a good resume but if youre going for the actual programming side people only look at bachelors in computer science degrees and up for stuff like internships and apprenticeships which honestly its just to weed out the completely bad programmers but theres other tracks to getting into programming than just having a bachelors coding bootcamps cost as much as a semester in college and is only about months long but theyll kick your ass you really need to be able to handle nearly crisis level situations and be able to learn fast to survive the bootcamps but once youre done with them generally theyll help place you into jobs and most of them have around rate of placing you into a programming job once you graduate from them they do cost like though if you factor in living expenses
IAmA,removed,honestly i just cant wait for pillars or a tyranny expansionsequel also forget kotor you guys should make your own game with laser swords and tons of philosophy if mass effect can exist you all can make your own version please please please just make it a crpg you guys completely dominate that genre i obsidian
IAmA,removed,good on you for teaching yourself how to code however the title is misleading you were already in with a minor league hockey team and had those connections to get the attention of the nhl blah blah you already had your foot in the door with a company that utilized your work most self taught guys arent going to have that and until they get their first programming job it will be a bit tough for them to reach out to big companies
IAmA,removed,thats one awesome cat
IAmA,removed,if you work with people that have different coding practices and this has made it more of a few inconsistencies with code formatting and bad practices
IAmA,removed,congrats man ive worked in it and stadium production rolls for over years and know the challenges that come with working in those environments awesome job and keep pushing because your idea has a lot of potential beyond the stadium too
IAmA,removed,fuck marry kill obama trump biden
IAmA,removed,no question i just love your cat
IAmA,removed,aside from learning how to program in months im actually more impressed with that app idea thats just such a great idea well done
IAmA,removed,im skeptical how much the current everyone can learn to code movement is sound im a very right brain kind of person i tend to be comfortable in creative endeavors and i struggle with mechanical stuff numbers etc ive dabbled in learning code but i find it mostly tedious and uninteresting i realize there is a creative element to it but im not convinced its worth becoming a mediocre coder rather than just devoting that time to adding and perfecting skills that are more complimentary and pleasing to the wiring of my brain also the more people that learn to code the supply of coders rises and the pay and benefits inevitably creep lower i envy successful coders and i think there will be plenty of demand for the time being but im hearing a lot of everyone should be a coder engineer etc these days and that just doesnt make sense in the long run
IAmA,removed,ive been wanting someplace to start
IAmA,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
IAmA,removed,im a self taught programmer as well i was fed up with my previous profession and working against the grain i wanted something better i too have spent the last months learning various languages frameworks etc two months ago i started applying for jobs and it has been a struggle i often here your portfolio and resume are great unfortunately we are looking for somebody with more experience i have had sr programmers go out of there way to tell me they were impressed with my resume and work yet wont hire me i need the work to get experience but need the experience to get the work what these companies dont realize is how loyal i would be once given a chance i work for hours each day on projects to keep my skills sharp but am starting to get desperate any advice for a guy trying to get his foot in the door someplace
IAmA,removed,i go to clemson what you did is awesome
IAmA,removed,cat was an epic addition
IAmA,removed,i received my neibors passport in the mail a week ago well i assume it cant be anything else the way it felt and the passport administration on the large envelope i did not open it duh i walked it to their house and put it in their mailbox as they did not answer the door the funny thing is im a resident alien and im russian so was funny as it came mere days before trump inauguration only the second us passport i have ever held in my hands lol the russians are evil
IAmA,removed,that is damn clever and will likely have neat uses down the line well done
IAmA,removed,i have an idea for an app but ive always figured teaching myself to code would be more trouble than its worth
IAmA,removed,i dont have any questions i just want to say great work and congratulations
IAmA,removed,what kind of programming techniques are you familiar with like are you familiar with how to multithread o use semaphores

IAmA,removed,i thoroughly enjoyed the article but found that it makes the same mistakes most stories on the opioid epidemic make which make them hard to take seriously by medical professionals in all of your stories the patients who end up as addicts are completely innocent people who had no idea that opioids could be addictive and are forced at gunpoint to take them and steal opioids from their friendsrelatives then move on to heroine theres absolutely no concept of personal responsibility another thing when i was a pcp i never prescribed opioids for chronic pain and i would get a lot of heat from it from patients people leaving my practice stealing prescription pads threatening my safety etc go to rchronicpain and there are plenty of posters there boasting about how they went to ten different doctors until they found one who would give it to them or how they would show up with family members at the doctors office and threaten them for narcotics these people are insane and the major reason why we have this problem in our country in the first place

IAmA,removed,this entire post seems to undo what ununsmockme uooohfuck and i work on every day in rhsvpositive and rherpes the key to helping people with hsv get through the stigma is educating people on the condition not making it sound like you cant eat or walk maybe for a small percentage thats the reality but not for most youre making herpes sound like a debilitating condition
IAmA,removed,nobodys calling anybodynobodys going in therenobodys rolling the dice on anythinguntil we find out what the fuck is happening in there it rhymes but i cant dance to it
IAmA,removed,whats your definition of no money i feel like many movies that are made with no money actually had millions or even hundreds of thousands or even a few thousands in the budget budget is not no money
IAmA,removed,saw the trailer and it wasnt good i dont think a good trailer could be made out of it looks like the movie sucks
IAmA,removed,this seems to be going about as well as rampart

IAmA,removed,thats just it police search cans now because a lot of head shops sell realistic cans to hide drugs in when someone is in plain site police dont suspect anything also these bottles are designed to look like something harmless ie tylenol advil etc this is a liquid bottle
IAmA,removed,are you
IAmA,removed,do you drive
IAmA,removed,what the hell does that have to do with my product
IAmA,removed,hey dudes i just bought this totally rad new product oh hella wild dude what is it its a fake medicine bottle that wait for it you can hide liquor in awe narly dude i know right the cops are so stupid they wouldnt be curious at all about a random tylenol bottle sitting in the cup holder or laying on the seat and now when you kill a family of you can just say you had a headache and were taking some tylenol but seriously this is a pretty badly thought out idea
IAmA,removed,he thinks that its a funny joke to get the cops to pull you over on suspicion of dwi i dont know if hes white but he sure as shit isnt black
IAmA,removed,i always like to be on the side of people taking risks putting themselves out there trying to make a buck etc but honestly this is pretty dumb from every angle it isnt even funny in this context here is a better idea it would be funny to create fake medicine bottles with hilarious labels and put them in your house or hide them in your friends house for example maybe you create some sort of liquid viagra label with all sorts of directions etc and put it in your friends medicine cabinet or maybe its for herpes whatever trying to get people to drink and drive covertly while pissing off the cops is cool if youre no

IAmA,removed,have you actually made any money from this horrible idea have you given up on our failed business are you starting to feel mega dumb about the fact that you probably stayed up late worked extra hard and got a giant reality check from strangers online the fact that you actually spent time and money on trying to market and sell this product is laughable and actually quite cringeworthy your product sucks and you suck even more
IAmA,removed,have you thought about what an awful idea coming off like an asshole to people is when promoting your company do you know what brand management is a minute skim over httpsenwikipediaorgwikibrandmanagement article may have made you fail at this venture in weeks instead of days
IAmA,removed,you selling this idea because you doesnt care what other people get up to and you just want to make money natural selection you say what if someone who uses your product to escape the dui as you put it but you dont condone it and crashes into your mothers car and kills her are you still fine with that then you might just have aspd
IAmA,removed,whatever you say youre a simpleton
IAmA,removed,lol
IAmA,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
IAmA,removed,heroin get the fck out of here youre gonna talk shit to me when ur a junky
IAmA,removed,not at all i was just proving my point to u
IAmA,removed,do you think if people as demonstrated in this ama hate your product its probably a good idea to think of something less dangerous
IAmA,removed,my product has nothing to do with columbine stay on point please
IAmA,removed,thanks for your input
IAmA,removed,if you could go back in time to help a former you masturbate would that be gay
IAmA,removed,lol
IAmA,removed,i do realize that and its fine but lets try to keep it semi on topic ya know
IAmA,removed,why not just go with the prank idea id be tempted to send my packer fan friends bottles of aaron rodgers tears it would still probably fail as this definitely will but at least you wouldnt be a pos looking to assist in dui
IAmA,removed,i dont need to this is something the market wants and needs this will be the next biggest thing second to ecigs and vapez
IAmA,removed,why the hell would you do this youre a massive jerk
IAmA,removed,its not plus shipping thats shippping included learn to read please you dont have oval amber bottles so please sit down
IAmA,removed,if thats how you feel i understand but i know how i feel in my brain
IAmA,removed,yes this one
IAmA,removed,not my problem
IAmA,removed,yes hideyourdrinkcom and doesnt mean its only about hiding a drink it goes beyond that its a gag gift a fashion statement etc
IAmA,removed,i do have feelings absolutely i really only created this for kids to think they were cool in school pretending to drink something they shouldnt i wanted people to put soda in it then people took it in a different direction so i just embraced it
IAmA,removed,yes mom
IAmA,removed,lol that actually was a good one maybe i am in denial a bit were all human no ones perfect
IAmA,removed,i was defending myself
IAmA,removed,i agree with you i honestly do thats why i said it was meant as a gimmick for kids in school to just drink their punch or soda out of and get people talking about them its a fashion accessory in my opinion
IAmA,removed,dollars for a fucking bottle holy fuck youd only be buying tgis if youre under influence rofl
IAmA,removed,lol its not a troll but ok
IAmA,removed,lol well put
IAmA,removed,thank you for the vote of confidence honestly
IAmA,removed,youd be right
IAmA,removed,no thats not ok and i have no tolerance for duiing
IAmA,removed,thanks for your input and i rarely drink myself
IAmA,removed,you didnt pay the like fee per year to make your sites whois info anonymous
IAmA,removed,np lol leaving this hotel now then filming
IAmA,removed,wouldnt it just be easier and more affordable to not drink and drive just drink when you get to where youre going and be responsible cops throwing you in the drunk tank doesnt equate to the cops being the bad guys it equates to you being reckless and idiotic plus i dont think anybody will pay that much when they can just clean out and recycle a bottle they already have in their home
IAmA,removed,does anyone fuck like gaston have good luck like gaston is anyones dick as incredibly thick like gastons
IAmA,removed,did you really think this was a good idea for a product and do you still after the response here did you understand that your product idea wasnt ethical ive noticed youve been changing your tone from your original idea to oh its just a gag or a joke thing but is that because people dont like it or because you genuinely realized how unethical it was to encourage that sort of harmful behavior i guess im curious as to if you are an aware and intentional asshole or just an idiot who is too dumb to think it out and realize the obvious
IAmA,removed,so whats it like being the leader of a hermit kingdom
IAmA,removed,oh i thought this was the kim jong ama whoops
IAmA,removed,do i have your blessing to introduce myself as el tigre chino
IAmA,removed,hi richard i like to tell people that i had a personal trainer and then describe gaston two dozen eggs size of a barge etc and see how long it takes them to catch on is there any way to convince you to go to vocaroo and record httpiimgurcomblpegjljpg
IAmA,removed,how how can anyone lack this much self awareness
IAmA,removed,why dont i just go buy a bottle of tylenol and just use that
IAmA,removed,thanks but youll be waiting a while as i do not drink let alone drink and drive appreciate the love nonetheless
IAmA,removed,drunken accidents are going to happen regardlessi cant control what people put inside the medicine bottle i certainly hope no one thinks to drink and drive with the product as im against drunk driving
IAmA,removed,thanks for the info very insightful
IAmA,removed,listen for the timenobody is condoning or promoting drunk drivingall were saying is the bottle is a way to conceal the liquor
IAmA,removed,its not just for concealing alcohol you simple minded idiot and thats not the only reason people are buying it its solely your decision what you put in it be creative not sure what to tell you
IAmA,removed,almost certain ill have to get back to you on that one though
IAmA,removed,yeah my point was really that if youve gotten to the point where the cop is asking to check your medicine bottle its because he already knows youre intoxicated
IAmA,removed,coming from a guy that named himself chillaryhinton
IAmA,removed,how big is your dick
IAmA,removed,hi frontpage all the questions from asians concerned about his racist yellowface portrayals got downvoted to oblivion but if anyones curious you can find some good discussions with various viewpoints on them
IAmA,removed,sidestepping the point that racism prevents people from access to education cool not really sure how lack of would solve problems here when you said it was the solution so ill just assume you wrote that wrong i am not talking about education with regards to minority races though im talking primarily about white people being the perpetuating force behind the association of the stereotypes with actual peoples behaviours which with proper cultural exposure would not happen nearly to the same degree we dont live in a free country that allows people to do blackface anymore you can still do blackface but other than kkkneonazi members i see empty theaters for anyone who tries the market is a substantial force we just had evidence of election rigging again nsa wiretapping wikileaks etc etc yes but independent freedom index which has economic freedom puts us at out of hundreds httpwwwheritageorgindexranking we also rank highly although perhaps not highly enough for human rights and press freedom httpuhriohchrorgensearchresultsccus so what youre really saying is we should do away with hatecrime laws in this country right no but speech alone isnt a crime depicting a svastika or promoting segregation promoting white supremacism isnt a crime alone if you advocate or threaten violence make false statements without evidence or hold up nooses for black people for example then those laws come into place i certainly wouldnt as a buddhist want to live in germany where depicting the svastikahakenkreuz is a crime because that is a symbol of my religion and has nothing to do with the nazis i wouldnt want to live in france where criticism of muslims for legitimate reasons is met with violence shootings and beheadings those shows are done by black people and practically the completely overarching main theme of boondocks is exposing the exact type of shit im taking about so now youre saying you cant be racist against your own race bd is a spoof of old blaxploitation themes which have been condemned by the population im guessing youve never actually watched them lol are you actually seriously equating them to blackface minstrel shows put on by white folks no i have watched both theyre hilarious but how is making fun of stereotypes and racism any different from kens character in the hangover a comedy movie just because the script wasnt written by a korean its entirely possible for a stereotype to be depicted purely for satire as i showed with my examples again gotta be trolling now right i obviously meant in a more local sense but if youre gonna offer up that fruit who runs those fields the taliban who sells that shit drug dealers but this is beside the point you my friend must be trolling after reading through your sjw rhetoric i need to watch some amazing atheist as eyebleach brb httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvteiguymgxa
IAmA,removed,what is size of the beasts d 😏
IAmA,removed,is there a big difference between starring in someone elses show and starring in your own to show
IAmA,removed,so when will you do it you fucking pussy bigbrother
IAmA,removed,travelers have their own language they call it cant they had its dead none of them can speak it
IAmA,removed,yesterday i ate kentucky fried chicken for lunch
IAmA,removed,six weeks thats crazy time do you do a lot of shakespeare or new works
IAmA,removed,six weeks thats crazy time do you do a lot of shakespeare or new works
IAmA,removed,six weeks thats crazy time do you do a lot of shakespeare
IAmA,removed,six weeks thats crazy time do you do a lot of shakespeare
IAmA,removed,six weeks thats crazy time do you do a lot of shakespeare or new works
IAmA,removed,so lets say youre in jail you have to think about your future when you get out unless you wish to return to whatever crime you wanted one program you could ask for was the prison to work no one makes you do this you asked for it you get released from jail to go to work and after work you return to jail because you still have a sentence to serve their sentences werent over when we hired them now if you would rather sit there bored you can that was also your option this isnt forced labor and i resent that you think that any kind of program made to help inmates is abuse there were other jobs to choose from too those that came to where i worked specifically chose us
IAmA,removed,ya know some of us didnt come from privilege and had to make our own way in life i worked my way through college and would work jobs in the summers it sure would have been nice to have college covered but it wasnt and that was just reality i was not about to sit at home with my parents and cry about it that being said i do actually support programs to help those who dont have money to pay for college and i support free votech and despite me still being not very high on the wage scale i give money to my nieces and nephews to help out really seems to me the ass is you until things change those without the means still need the opportunities they can get
IAmA,removed,nearly all of them stayed on once released as well only had one who had drug issues who would go on a bender every time he was released we could tell when it was coming though so we never fired him but would just wait the few weeks it took to hear from him again
IAmA,removed,being in the wrong place at the wrong time fucks up some peoples lives
IAmA,removed,most of our guys just had drug issues but we had some with more serious crimes some were pretty bad but as long as they were treated like human beings they could deal with life i only had one with severe anger issues that threatened to beat the crap out of me from day he was in jail for the third time for beating a girlfriend to the point of hospitalization he really was not ready for life outside of a cell yet he was pissed when he saw his manager was female i was very very very careful around him he couldnt keep himself together and ended up losing his position he needed counseling or something to help him out
IAmA,removed,what part of paid the same fucking wage do you not get
IAmA,removed,same wage dumbass yes there were tax breaks but we kept them when they were released without the tax breaks do you hate prisoners or something
IAmA,removed,the fact that the owner took a tax break wasnt anything i had any say over i was a shift manager who liked having employees who showed up all of us were paid crap i was not in a position to do a damn thing about it all of us quitting and being home is not an option maybe teh owner masturbated all over whatever tax break he got i dont know but when you keep the employee on after they are releasedno more tax break yes fast food pays crap it always has wtf are you looking for everyone benefited the prisoners benefited the company benefited i benefited because i certainly couldnt run the place alone do you actually work or do you live off your parents until someone agrees to pay you a salary
IAmA,removed,hey i live blocks away from edwins in shaker heights amazing place amazing food amazing service and an absolutely awesome cause keep it up brother
IAmA,removed,i didnt have control over wages the wages were the same as regular workers it gave them a way to have a job when they were released no where did i say service jobs didnt deserve more money but being an employee i didnt have the option to set wages you assholes who think any program that employees prisoners is some ploy to pay less are fucking brain dead
IAmA,removed,nope
IAmA,removed,the option for many people is to take a job or be homeless if the students had other opportunities great as it was every restaurant in the are paid the same i worked at several there was no magical job change you could make in restaurants and make some great wage unless you were going into high end restaurants that werent about to hire poor people those with no skills or convicts you also accused me of being the one to be getting some amazing benefit when i was merely an employee as well but i hated getting stuck working an entire shift alone because other assholes wouldnt show up if you didnt want the job quit so someone else could be hired i liked the prison to work because they came to work plus after they got out of prison they stayed with us so i then knew i wasnt stuck doing it alone ive also been in several positions in life where it was take the crappy position or be homeless i very much doubt you have ever been in that position based on your attacks i stand by the the prison to work program because it helped them transition to being released from prison more easily and they could save the money they made to put on an apartment when they got out
IAmA,removed,for the last fucking time any new employee prison to work or student or whatever started at the same damn wages those who were in jail were not paid less it was a program set up to help ease the transition from prison to being on their own they could save their money to get an apartment when they got out we kept them on if they wished to continue employment after they were released we didnt ditch them when they were nonprisoners we were only looking for people who bothered to show up and would actually work the way to get fast food restaurants to pay more is to raise the minimum wage i never once stated i was against that
IAmA,removed,that doesnt negate the point that the prison to work was a great program i had worked several restaurants in the area an they all had problems with attendance and the pay was always the same a lot of people in low in restaurant work are in their first job and dont realize they wont get shit for a referral for a better job the prison to work people where trying to change their lives around it was a great program for most of them and i was happy to work with them
IAmA,removed,no where did i ever say that youre projecting in fact this was the early so i started at lived on my own and made it work my clothes came from goodwill and i rented a single room that just fit a twin bed and a desk i didnt own a car walked or bicycled everywhere and was fine my hobbies were reading and bicycling back then there werent cell phones to suck up peoples wages and few owned computers i didnt watch tv i really dont see how you think that existence was so terrible the base level of living has change over the last years the house my parents bought still had an outhouse and an outdoor well betcha didnt know it was possible to not be completely miserable with an outhouse right my dad put in all the plumbing himself there was one wood stove for heat up until i was about years old i do vote for the policies to raise the minimum wage but the entire point of the thread was helping those with criminal backgrounds get a chance at changing their lives you appear to have an issue with people hiring them for some reason even if its for the same wage everyone else made thats what i dont understand ultimately it helped them out i was in no position to do a damn thing about the wages its called people doing what they can with what they have i was reliable at at that time would have made us feel rich in fact i was reliable at at my first real job and reliable at the crappy babysitting job my mom signed me up for one year at hoursweek at cents per hour for kids with mental issues when i was work ethic cant be bought its either there or it isnt
IAmA,removed,that is absolutely not what kept wages low it was a tiny program that only a few people used the owner was not going to raise the wages no matter how many people we went through or how much the few of us who remained had to suffer for it
IAmA,removed,you obviously are not a person who has ever had to pay rent on low pay when you have no sick or vacation days no pay no rent becoming homeless having been there i was very reliable for work in fact i could still get references from the store managers years later if i needed it even though i was a student with more skills i was pushed into restaurant work by my mom and once thats your work experience its hard to convince someone to allow you in an office i preferred having a roof over my head so i showed up i picked up extra shifts i worked extra jobs i cut corners everywhere my budget was pay check to pay check down to the last penny the closest thing i had to health care was planned parenthood youre fucking privileged if you have the crazy notion people can just walk away from a minimum wage job when then have nothing else
IAmA,removed,thanks im angry because i dont think people really understand how poor people live at this point in my life ive finally moved into the buffer zone for the middle class oddly enough im not afraid of the lower areas i lived in there is a bit of camaraderie that comes from a shared experience i think im distressed because i hear the trump rhetoric every day on one side so there im called a libtard but the liberals consider me some horrible right winger sorry im someone who started from the poor miserable masses people claim to be helping and both sides really suck fucking moose dick at helping i have been homeless twice which caused me to take time out from college until i got back on my feet if you get to talk about the plight of the poor from your sociology class not meaning you specifically but a general you of other people then you are privileged and dont know shit
IAmA,removed,really if you want terrible programs how come some skilled wages are kept low just because they deal with the elderly cnas are paid only dollars above minimum wage yet they are responsible for the care and safety of those who cant care for themselves i see that as being far worse than any fast food restaurant the elderly dont have the option of walking away from the nursing home when they dont get adequate care but noooo somehow the entire focus in the us is the poor fast food workers
IAmA,removed,how much money are you able to launder every month
IAmA,removed,thanks nice to meet you too it was rough getting off the street it included forgetting some threats some scams and a sexual assault oddly enough i could still do it on minimum wage i just had to work a few jobs for a while what hindered me more is id start dating someone and hed quit working with the same rant on how hes worth more than they were paying him leaving me to pay everything alone until i could get him out of my life thats part of the reason i really really hate the well ill just quit because you dont pay me enough the general view at the time was that it was ok for women to work demeaning jobs because they had no pride and it was that or prostitution i used to completely lose my head over that crap all of this changes a lot if you have kids planned parenthood not only kept me supplied birth control but when i turned up with displaysia the start that leads to uterine cancer they were the only place with a sliding scale fee so that i could get treatment i really really really dont want to see them go away
IAmA,removed,can you really believe that its not butter ive tried it any it is my personal belief that it definitely isnt butter i butter and ghee httpwwwicantbelieveitsnotbuttercom
IAmA,removed,show me them svetty bawls baybee but for real does it need to be in question form what is show me them svetty bawls for alek
IAmA,removed,gabi you are worthless i am also pretty sure your website is in violation of several eu regulations in months you will be turning tricks for russian businessmen in warsaw
IAmA,removed,you cant seem to get the point that you started firing off on wages when in my original post i never said a single thing about people not deserving more im all for it but you jumped on me accusing me of being the one keeping wages low youre post has been out of line from the start
IAmA,removed,having worked in the restaurants that wouldnt hire from the prison to work i can tell that isnt what happened those who showed up to work always had to cover the slack of those who didnt show i was supporting giving prisoners jobs and suddenly everyone thought i was against raising wages
IAmA,removed,i never said that ive always been for raising it youre projecting i know what demanding a pay increase would have gotten me fired i still think prison to work programs are great because they help the prisons transfer to having jobs when they get out they werent paid less than what other employees were paid
IAmA,removed,everyone has a high school degree or more ummmmno they dont you obviously havent spent any time on the other side of the tracks where the poor people are find me anywhere in my conversation where i ever said minimum wage shouldnt be higher oh righti was a poor employee so i must be some conservative monster
IAmA,removed,gag rules are a big thing that have to go away when i was working in restaurants i was shocked how many of the women didnt know that they could get exams and birth control for free at the time due to being poor one was complaining about being pregnant again kid and she never wanted kids that began the discussion about it she was pissed no one ever told her before people in the middle to upper classes think everyone knows but they dont it takes getting the information to the poorer areas to help them the only way to help is to go to the areas that scare people
IAmA,removed,do you take high and test shots if you dont can you go to a dr and get it prescribed and ill buy it off you

IAmA,removed,this was a huge problem for me and my roommates a couple of years ago we lived in an apartment in denver that we later realized had bedbugs and we begged our landlords to fix the problem as they were contractually obligated but they kept sending somebody who claimed that he couldnt find evidence we called a lawyer who said that we couldnt claim unsuitable living conditions because bedbugs are technically classified as pests and only vermin yield legal repercussions it was so fucking frustrating we eventually settled on calling denver public health who were able to help us put pressure on our landlords to send somebody to clean up but we had to stay in the apartment for the whole ordeal broke college kids we were being bitten all the time but we didnt have real legal recourse and the apartment owners clearly didnt feel intimidated because there wasnt a whole lot we could do to them in retaliation i think this should be addressed in legal terms so that landlords feel more pressure to deal with this issue also fuck the overlook at mile high dont ever fucking rent from those thieves
IAmA,removed,nobody said that but i sure as hell wouldnt be leaving children unattended around a catholic priest given how often pedophilia has been considered a systemic issue in the organisation also how the fuck arent you being downvoted with such a bullshit rhetorical question thats purely about deflecting childrape
IAmA,removed,dude i work in housing support services in mental health housing the first time i discovered bed bug infestation it was devastation pure awful devastation i still have ptsd from it i went into lockdown mode in my own house taking off all my clothing as soon as i walk into the house putting them in the washer and washing them spraying my car daily with can bed bug spray checking my own seams on my mattress daily its been a year and a half and i still bag my clothes daily so they dont mix in the general population of my house it took us months to rid our work house of the infestation it was awful the service we used employed an organic product it was shit now we use a service that uses a harsher chemical that the residents have to get out for hours i cant go to a hotel without pulling the things off the mattress and checking the seams pulling the cases off the pillows checking seams in the chairs in fact i only went to one hotel and cant stand to even try for another one i look carefully at any chair i sit in and cringe at any public seat now that i have to sit in especially when i smell someone nearby who has that smell from bed bug treatment in fact if i even whiff that smell i wont sit and the worst part is we currently have other residences in our program with bed bugs whose residents come hang at our house while their house gets bombed i feel like i cant be safe ever again and want to move to live on a beach

IAmA,removed,hello and thank you for doing this ama i just moved into my first house and my toilet is not working very well and i am not sure what to do about it the flushing mechanism forgive my ignorance of the correct terms is working well and the container that holds the water fills just fine but every time i flush i have to hold the handle till just the right moment or the water wont flush correctly it rises then goes down leaving some or most of the contents still in the toilet the window for a good flush is very small and i have been flushing some times three times just to get it to work i am relatively broke right now because we just moved in and i am hoping i can find a way to fix it with out breaking the bank any help on identifying the problem or possible ways to fix would be greatly appreciated thank you again
IAmA,removed,id like to become a plumber myself how would i go about starting that
IAmA,removed,hello and thanks for doing this posting a question for my boyfriend im keeping an eye on my energy consumption im wondering what my well might contribute all i know is that its deep and a submersible pump im not sure what brand or how to remove it to check thank you
IAmA,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
IAmA,removed,im staying at my brothers house one of his toilets isnt flushing very well like it has a lack of flushing power or isnt draining always have to use a plunger after i poop what could i do to fix this
IAmA,removed,aw man i hope you are able to help me too i have an issue with my kitchen sink it has a hose with a spray gun but at one point it stopped working properly now the water flow doesnt divert completely to the spray fun so it has less pressure and the sink faucet still runs some water when using the gun i looked online and it said i needed to replace the diverted but when taking my sink apart i cant seem to find one i would love to fix this over the holidays when im home its awesome that youre answering these questions even if you dont get to mine
IAmA,removed,my toilet was making a dripping sound it looked like it was coming from the upright tower like piece on top of which is the hinge for the floater arm i tightened the screw on the arm connected to the floater and the dripping stopped but now the water seems to fill constantly it also seems like water is constantly but at low volume filling the bowl
IAmA,removed,its great youre doing this so my issue is that the toilet is leaking when i flush it leaks from the pipe between the reservoir and the toilet
IAmA,removed,pretty late but how does it feel knowing that your a plumber and im reading your post while on the toliet
IAmA,removed,my faucet in my kitchen somehow starts pooring the hot water before going cold whenever i havent used the faucet in a while it goes something like this turn on cold water cold water comes out most likely whatever was left in the pipes then gradually hotter water untill its idk kinda hot then starts going cold and eventually gets cold all of this without messing with the knob at all takes about mins to get proper cold water running hopefully you can give me an answer to this as it is not one of those problems that come up on the first couple of pages on google which is usually the way i solve things thanks very much for doing ama
IAmA,removed,so our toilet keeps making that pssshhhh sound and filling up when it shouldnt be i know my dad has tried a couple of things but nothing has worked
IAmA,removed,give up your silly little fantasy and conform to your god given gender roles or you might grow up to realize no guy wants anything to do with you you cunt
IAmA,removed,the drain in my sink is clogged and so is the drain in the bath tub same bathroom dad tried using a snake to clean out the bath tub drain but it got stuck its been stuck in there for years help
IAmA,removed,not a mall santa but i was an elf over thanksgiving break im its kinda hard to find a job at my age since companies cant legally hire me but my friend was a mall santa and he said he needed help so i worked for an hour working with kids all day isnt that bad babysitting is much worse memorable experiences one kid said she didnt want her dad to come back from deployment because her new dad was better another kid literally asked for a red ryder bb gun with a compass and a thingy that tells time built right into the stock and then started giggling i think his dad made him ask for this it took my friend santa everything he had to not say youll shoot your eye out another kid asked for a thousand bucks and a thousand dough it took us a while to realize he wanted deer not money a lot of tablets makeup jewelry and purses are asked for and kids asking for pets isnt too uncommon well year olds typically want puppies and ponies and unicorns is typically makeup purses iphones etc anyone older is usually something like a tv for their bedroom we actually got a few teenagers coming up jokingly asking for stuff before we started turning them down
IAmA,removed,shitters full
IAmA,removed,fascists arent like that
IAmA,removed,theres a rest room i never use
IAmA,removed,former maintenance man here buy a fucking plunger not one of those little cent dollar store ones that flips inside out but a nice manly plunger
IAmA,removed,everyone wants to know lol how many times you caught people at it
IAmA,removed,my bathroom sink seems to fill with water faster than it drains however when i operate the drain stop it releases what seems to be an airlock and then it drains quicker i was going to try to clear out the trap but didnt know this could even happen
IAmA,removed,my toilet tank keeps filling with water it just drains into the over flow i adjusted the floater thing all the way down but it still fills up and keeps draining into the overflow httpiimgurcomrahibwhjpg
IAmA,removed,how do you feel about selling your soul
IAmA,removed,our apartment hot water comes out cloudy is there a reason for this and lately cold is cloudy as well if i put cold through water filter its clear no foul odour or taste they day its fine but its odd it just started happening

IAmA,removed,i just want to say thank you i had a lot of traumatic experiences as a kid but i always had one of your books in my hands during these times escaping to the creepy world of goosebumps got me through many rough times and i feel are the reason i still read today as an adult while the werewolf of fever swamp will always be my favorite i loved the ones with the great twist endings like my hairiest adventure and a shocker on shock street when i was i even named my dog stine thank you again mr stine you will always have my enduring gratitude
IAmA,removed,the beast from the east my favourite goosebumps no real question i used to have a huge stack of them i passed them down to my cousin
IAmA,removed,mr stine thanks for the horror novels in which i could choose my fate those books were the shit
IAmA,removed,werewolf of fever swamp terrified me as a kid and im sure thats what led to my love of all things horror especially of the supernatural and your young adult books i loved the boyfriend
IAmA,removed,i believe you had once stated that you often got ideas from conversations you overheard what was a crazy convo that unfortunately was too gross to publish btw big fan reading your books since elementary
IAmA,removed,i love your intros in rl grimes halloween mixes
IAmA,removed,i heavily enjoyed reading your work in my adolescence
IAmA,removed,is it nice to know you freak kids out
IAmA,removed,sorry but you are non rl stine you are jovial bob stine and its your job to teach me how to be funny begin
IAmA,removed,not really a question but ive always had a hard time reading and as a kid your book hide and shriek was the first book i ever read and actually liked so thank you so much for that
IAmA,removed,what is your favorite type of donut
IAmA,removed,hello mr stine i dont have a question i just wanted to thank you after moving from russia to the us at a young age i basically spent all my free time reading your stories in the library which not only improved my language but also introduced me to my favorite genre
IAmA,removed,happy halloween mr stine id like to know what got you into writing specifically into the horror genre
IAmA,removed,i just wanted to say you definitely had a huge impact on me as a child i grew up in a really less than stellar environment but someone gifted me a complete goosebumps collection when i was a child and i was able to get lost in your books i not only grew to love reading i began to write my own stories as well recently i decided to pursue my dream of writing thank you for making such a positive impact on my life
IAmA,removed,just wanna let you know you helped me find out i liked to read i also wanna let you know that i stole sooo much silver change from my parents as a kid so i could order your books from scholastic when it came to school never thought to ask them to buy me books
IAmA,removed,thank you for the stories i read as a kid along with a few others you shapes who i am
IAmA,removed,thank you for making my childhood
IAmA,removed,what is the most terrifying thing to happen to you and how if it has has it affectedinspired your stories
IAmA,removed,i loved reading goosebumps as a kid thank you for writing them
IAmA,removed,thanks so much for your books from me and my wife we both practically learned to read with goosebumps
IAmA,removed,good guy stine doing a halloween ama

IAmA,removed,its thanks to you i have a fear of ventriloquist dolls ever since i was thank you for producing slappy one of my worst nightmares
IAmA,removed,probably wont get seen this late but im in my and absolutely loved goosebumps books when i was in elementary school read all of them for years thanks for all your work and for getting myself and countless other kids into reading
IAmA,removed,well his promoterpublisher did a lousy job or theres a chance it was actually him and he was awful i choose to believe the former

IAmA,removed,just wanted to say my five year old is your biggest fan right now we are reading through the series stuck looking for deep trouble right now though no library in our area has it cant wait to keep her reading
IAmA,removed,i dont have a question and you probably wont see this but i immigrated to the states in from vietnam and during the first few years of living in this country starting as a third grader i did nothing but read your goosebumps books it was actually a huge source of my english language skills and though i cant remember all of them off the top of my head i know that i spent time reading every book from that series my favorites were the werewolf swamp story as well as the monster under the grandparents house story and the parents who turn their pets into kids actually many of them were quite good so thanks mr stine for giving me stories and helping me build my english skills the latter of which is undoubtedly one of the most vital lessons i ever have and continue to use today
IAmA,removed,i just want to say your books made my childhood thank you for writing books broke the mold and taught us kids its ok to think differently outside the box and that its ok to be weird and unique
IAmA,removed,i am late and dont have a question just loved the goosebumps books and wanted to say thanks for the hours of enjoyment as a kid
IAmA,removed,how does it feel to be a hack who has profited from the fact it is easy to scare young kids
IAmA,removed,i just want to share something with you at least now that i have the opportunity for which i have to thank reddit and its community i moved here from a different country at the age of and i did not speak english at all my family moved here in the summer into an apartment complex that was mostly populated by either college students or young working professionals because of this it was very hard for me to make friends since the school year had not started and i did not speak english to combat boredom i ended up going to the local library and checking out as many of your books as i possibly could i read so many of them that i literally remember the names of the people in the books to this day and im i like to think that the reason that i learned to speak english so quickly was because of the type of language that you used in the books easy and accessible and the context of a story helped me piece things together without actually having a grasp of english so i would just humbly like to thank you
IAmA,removed,bob i cant thank you enough for making week long winter caravan holidays in wales with my parents tolerable i would just take goosebump books and read them over and over whilst trying not to listen to my dad shit in a cupboard

IAmA,removed,i dont feel threatened but i imagine some do because allowing companies to exploit illegal labor depresses wages for everyone even allowing them to legally exploit foreign labor eg the visa system depresses wages americans dont want to compete with workers coming from the third world who are willing to accept a much lower standard of living although i dont share their antiimmigrant sentiment its very easy to place yourself in their shoes and understand it

IAmA,removed,since i have to ask a question why someting something seriously they wentoversease to murder people and their entire deal for being restricted from society is because everyone in the entire world knows that soldiers kill people and while its good to forgive mistakes its also somethings good to show people how society treats murderers even if they were brainwashed its not a fucking excuse i do hope they get into something that isnt another way of killing people here is a questionmark because now this is totally a questions right
IAmA,removed,dude could you just stop fucking kicking the religious yes they are idiots but you being a collossal penis to them doesnt fucking help youre not doing it stylishly enough for them to get the message and logic doesnt work on them because their entire point is that logic isnt useful and therefore they dont improve it you have to understand that if it wasnt for those morons we wouldnt have a lot of art and while its really not beneficial anymore it was a useful legacy system so eliminating it isnt really that good an idea when it served to help get the world to where it is science isnt the only way especially since it literally doesnt take feelings into account and considering that logic extended far enough becomes circular anyway so yeah nice books nice fame but youre still a bit of a dick and the only thing you even do anymore is act as a science celebrity dara o brein is infinitely more of a good force in this world than you ever will be and while we do still need you the only thing you do anymore is steer money into your own wallet and weaken your ability to love and make the assumption that everything can be explained when youre not in possession of the sensory ability to gather information about everything the entire universe builds itself instantaneously as a fractal formula from nothing up to your current world viewcollective dissonance and the descriptions you give unfortunately are such a tiny little smidgen of the whole picture relative to human emotion that you will never have any kind of effect on people other than them thinking wow hes really narrow in his scope focus on something that blows peoples fucking minds so my question is why is reddits filter so easy to overcome if this place makes so much money
IAmA,removed,oh yeah and it was nice and warm and i was having a lovely day and then you come along and steal my heat so i guess my real question is why are you such a colossal tool the amount of hatred in your world comes from you and im directing it back at you because youre literally a happiness burglar wouldnt you rather live ina happy world that you dont understand if i could become a rainbow i would would you and if you wouldnt what the fuck is wrong with you
IAmA,removed,youre an ugly angry little man dawkins and there is no way youll ever steal our happiness again this is a question for reddits super advanced high budget multibillion dollar question detector it totally uses nlp and machine learning and its fully automated by a guy eating cheetos starring in both fear and jurassic park and may be even the dude from the wow episode of south park and this is definitely a questions because loook its agot a question mark at the end the level of retardation in this thread would make corporal ray pearson cry from laughter after seeing every one of his words come true
IAmA,removed,i just need you to know that i hate you everything you do and write you are the worst kind of person if somebody was physically harming you and i saw it i would not stop themi hope with my entire being that you die a long painful and lonely death fuck you
IAmA,removed,hello what do you think about this
IAmA,removed,hello dick dorkins my question is why do you allow yourself to be suck a cuck for the imperialists
IAmA,removed,dicky d are you lookin for a hand beezy
IAmA,removed,are you on dumb
IAmA,removed,consciousness is an illusion composed of information inside of quantum microtubules in neurons neurons then work together to disseminate this info via electrical signals it evolved because of eating fruits that made our brain bigger than it needed to be and eventually conscious this happened over million years ago either that or aliens i have absolutely no proof to back any of this up
IAmA,removed,why are feminists so tight lipped about how women in the middle east are being treated yet get outraged at the mythical gender wage gap and manspreading etc same can be said about the lgbt community they are up in arms about which toilet a tranny can use yet stay silent about how gay people are being chucked off of roofs are hanged from cranes
IAmA,removed,yeah i was wondering how you ma
IAmA,removed,i dont really have anything to ask but i just wanted to say congratulations on moving into that position i was a control room operator at a coal plant for years and i enjoyed it like you said if things are going smooth then there isnt much to do and that is why i found a new job same company same industry very cool ama keep up the good work and dont become complacent
IAmA,removed,its on his twitter fuckface
IAmA,removed,who did negan really kill and why wasnt it you
IAmA,removed,will the show follow the comic or branch out like the other twd stories also will there be mid season breaks thank you for amazing stories
IAmA,removed,wasnt it only days of training
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,the answer is what you thought it was we did the right thing we know what we did and were gonna keep doing it all night long were not gonna pull out were gonna keep pushin if nothing else brings you back to watch season we have a planned cg effect similar to the blood splattered screen that were going to debut at the end of the episode were dedicating to showing michonne and ricks method of coping with the heartbreak
IAmA,removed,listen the death already happened theres no cliffhanger there someone do dead and thats a fact jack the mystery is who thats what you need to come back to find the cast member who died is filming in ga hes going to ghost lori through the season and were making a sextape with him and jon bernthal to serve as the cliffhanger for season does he pregnant or no will we have poclips butt babies tune in gimple is a genius
IAmA,removed,we had to give her this character growth so that she followed the prerequisite regret of killing that weve used so many times in the past to foreshadow coming death when it turns out that negan has killed her youll realize there was never a cliffhanger there was a wwe caliber screw job to take the championship away from your expectations
IAmA,removed,this is a real interesting one every time i am asked if daryl is coming to the comics or whether or not his inclusion in the show was my idea im reminded of the story of how daryl came into the equation its a good story titilating it could be the best story ever everyone knows it im not going to waste any time retelling old stories in this ama not my idea but there may be some sexual favors involved in the story of how the character came to be
IAmA,removed,very important question for you who has the bigger dick you or negan or was negans based off yours
IAmA,removed,im not pretending butt babies may be an actual thing youll have to tune in oct to find out carls dead

IAmA,removed,sort by controversial to see a bunch of people upset over some stupid ass shit lol
IAmA,removed,do you swallow
IAmA,removed,i heard on msnbc and huffington post that you allegedly raped princess leah since they are news it must be true why did you do it also hearing rumors on cnn that you killed her today is this true as well
IAmA,removed,whos this phaggot
IAmA,removed,its still considered as somehow damaging specifically to a female and females are also considered less capable of agency than males this is why sentences for women sleeping with boys below the age of consent are frequently lighter the law is written with the notion of protecting minors it is applied with the notion that females are disgraced by sex and thus incapable of volition
IAmA,removed,i would call your post stupid except it hints at a possible underlying message as if perhaps you believe the juno mission is a fake or some other conspiracy nutjob nonsense which really pushes it out of the realm of stupid and into the domain of batshit crazy either way seek help there is still hope ps im pointing laser waves at your brain pan over the interwebs im actually an agent of the alphabet agency that reports to the lizard overlords if you take off your leadandfoil hat and comply with my probe i wont report your insurgency to the overlords
IAmA,removed,rick nybakken hey mr nybakken former member of troop very cool to see the work youve done congratulations
IAmA,removed,my uncle is a huge conspiracy theorist and every family gathering he talks about his latest conspiracy and keeps showing my dad youtube videos and random stuff to prove them during our fourth of july barbecue he brought up the moon landing he started talking about how it was impossible to get past some radiation ring at the time and that the landing was fake so while my dad was there listening to him we were inside laughing so i ask you nasa scientist if it was possible for the space ship to get past that radiation ring at the time not sure of the name of the ring but you guys work at nasa so you probably know what i mean
IAmA,removed,i am so sorry for your loss i dont have a question but i honestly am sorry
IAmA,removed,did you manage to get your underpants clean or did you have to throw them away

IAmA,removed,im very sorry if this is a sensitive subject but i remember you mentioning an addiction treatment center on one of your podcasts this made me wonder if you could give some quick advice about how to help somebody suffering from alcoholrelated issues because i have a friend who does and wont get help for his alcohol problems thanks 💕
IAmA,removed,i didnt say there isnt a problem i said personally i havent watched his roles and thought it had anything to do with most asians i just thought it was a weird fucking role that they happened to cast an asian in
IAmA,removed,its probably too late now but my year old niece is battling neuroblastoma in orange county ca could i maybe get you to call her and say hello and wish her well

IAmA,removed,former wells fargo employee here the notion that if you are not in contact with a banker then everything is ok is incorrect firstly from my experience most of their investment accounts or have a high annual fee typically which eat the bulk of any returns you will see shop around rpersonal finance recommends vanguard secondly the account requirements before this fiasco for each type of account would regularly increase so that many of their customers would be pushed out of their free accounts and then the banker could open another new account that was free stop banking at wells
IAmA,removed,hey thanks for doing this i have a quick question when i walk up to a teller do they no anything about my account history such as if ive been overdrawn in the past or have called about fees in a way to determine risk at that point in time

IAmA,removed,how does it make you feel to be a privlaged person that can travel and think you making a difference when really your just showing these poor people that theyll never be able to leave and that your lime a god to them because you know about the world maybe you should think about actually trying to help you know these kids get raped and murdered day in and day out and no one bats an eye
IAmA,removed,why are you more concerned with girls leadership than boys being set on fire and murdered i would sooner donate to a hate group than fuel your ideology

IAmA,removed,sorry youre gonna have to find a game more interesting than phoneme farm to keep my childs attention shes introduced to many video games one of the best being portal i suppose this would work for kids too young for real video games and others that havent been exposed to licensed entertainment maybe if it were actually a simpsons theme or there was way more in the game than what is offered id use it for now shes going to stick with reading at night and sight words that are already taught in most school systems anyway
IAmA,removed,k
IAmA,removed,yes you use the fucking search function you fucking twat
IAmA,removed,yeah almost like this place is populated by normal people and not cocksucking pedantic autistic pieces of shit like yourself
IAmA,removed,no i read significantly higher than my grade level all throughout school i choose to be a cunt because fuck you and kill yourself
IAmA,removed,you need a dick in the mouth
IAmA,removed,this isnt a problem the us rules by violence domestic terrorism aka police and ignorance its just their way to run their whole country helping kids making them read stuff would probably cause a nothing more than a dysfunction in the system
IAmA,removed,and you should kill yourself for being old and worthless when you arent even middle aged yet and cant even understand that there is an entire fucking world you have never seen and will never understand now fuck off and drink bleach grandpa
IAmA,removed,yes you fucking marketing droid everything is a very good question heres a fucking hint to anyone that isnt a marketing droid and doesnt suck proverbial dick for a living when someone says thats a very good question what theyre actually saying is i do not know and i am now going to make some shit up and pretend that i am answering when i am not doing so note the complete fucking lack of sources in this entire ama op is a cunt
IAmA,removed,i would just like to point out that from a statistical point of view if of the kids read below grade level then the grade levels are arbitrarily chosen targets and not statistically arrived at
IAmA,removed,i just wanted to say dr colvard that your explanation of whole word reading answers a lot of my suspicions about how people often dont seem to read the actual letters in words these days it explains so much about how people can be bad at drastically mispronouncing words by throwing in or omitting different letters in words with which people arent very familiar thank you for the info my mind is a little blown right now thank you for the work youre doing and i wish you the best of luck and speed in helping others to learn and remember the importance of language and literacy
IAmA,removed,you see a turd on the side of the road clearly a wet and sickly foul turd the surface has mostly dried out preventing the foul odor from escaping which do you do stir not stir

IAmA,removed,my kindergarten is teaching using the phoneme method i didnt even know it had a name it was weird at first because they were making kids repeat the sound as if they had a stutter like cacacar
IAmA,removed,its not access to tutorials that create the problem kids just dont care about it anymore somewhere along the lines it became against social norm to raise intelligent children parents care more about their kids social needs than intellectual needs
IAmA,removed,most children that are below the reading level have parents that dont care enough to read with them at home they sit back and expect teachers to raise their children for them
IAmA,removed,what made you go with a pickup weapon style model that quake had over say a class based model similar to or perhaps some hybrid model between the two i think i remember you talking about unique movement styles for each class a few monthsyears back which sounded interestingunless im remembering it wrong what made you move away from that idea
IAmA,removed,maybe your grade level statistics are too high and of students read above the real grade level
IAmA,removed,the simpsons is without a doubt the best tv series ever produced i swear to god if the bbc hosted an international part programme naming the current best released tv series ever the simpsons would win just like chuchill won the greatest briton

IAmA,removed,i just want to say that no matter want happens there are amazing resources available to you all over the country these men and women worked with me for years to put together a treatment plan that worked for my gbs i was diagnosed with growing pains in my legs at weeks later i was paralyzed from the waist down and was losing sensation in my upper extremities my general practitioner went out on a limb and sent me to a neurologist on a hunch well his hunch of gbs was correct i spent years battling a chronic version of gbs it was hell on earth to be slowly trapped inside your own body at the peak of adolescence i was told on multiple occasions that i may never walk again and that i should prepare for a lifetime of dealing with symptoms and side effects i was and wheel chair bound for most of sophomore year of high school im now and i havent seen a flair up or any symptoms in years just know that it can get better i was beat down ready to quit angry and sad for the first year or so of dealing with it there was a a point where i just said fuck it no matter what life threw at me id already survived something that most people would never even heard about from there things got easier not a lot easier but enough to lift my head up and take a step forward almost years later and im still taking steps those steps led me away from that terrible place i was in mentally and physically those steps led me miles away from the place i hated to place that im now proud of i guess im rambling but i guess i really just wanted to say this it gets better even when it feels like it cant get any worse it gets better sincerely someone who cant be held down

IAmA,removed,last summer i got salmonellafor days i was constantly in the toilet with extreme diarrheaafter a week i was a lot better and i hit the treadmilli was about min in my workout and i noticed i disnt have strength to lift my own legi thought it was a simple muscle injurybut after a week i saw no improvementi went for mri and blood testsin the beginning they thought of cancer in my spine or head pressing the nervesi was terrifiedbut after a lot of tests they found it was guillain barrenow after a year i am like it never happenedso keep calm and be patient the thing that it was most shocking it was that i didnt even have strength to press the pedals in my cari wish you a speedy recovery

IAmA,removed,and studies of suicidal ideation find strong statistical correlations with these aspects of traditional masculinity how strong i havent seen any exact figures posted how do you quantify it and how do you weigh it against positive aspects of traditional masculinity no one is calling for emasculating all men were calling for opening up models of manhood so that men can ask for help share feelings build supportive networks and deal better with stress crisis and loss and doing that will save mens lives im on board with building support networks and all that ive suffered from pretty bad depression myself in the past and those are some things that i absolutely would have benefited from i apologize if im misunderstanding your intentions but youve repeatedly painted a particular set personality traits as problematic i dont understand what personality traits have to do with the existence of support networks and destigmatization of mental illness that seems to be a false dichotomy personality traits such as stoicism and emphasis on independence are not necessarily something a person is taught to use myself as an example i grew up in a very liberal city with liberal peers and teachers and so on i was taught that its okay for boys to cry and i was encouraged to embrace my feminine side regardless as an adult i turned out to be pretty far on the stoic and independent side these traits are very likely to have a genetic component i hope you can understand then why im having a hard time with the suggestion that i should be untaught an integral part of my identity and moreover that we should be attempting to modify our childrens personalities without any consideration for negative consequences that this may entail

IAmA,removed,no question just want to say years ago espn debuted by saying heres some fucking sports news you basiccable watching bunch of fuck sticks ps inspired by your twitter thanks for being out there
IAmA,removed,hi david i absolutely love treme for the time on tv you guys showed the broad range of what its actually like to be a musician im curious if you can tell us what the discussions were like leading to that decision and how you arrived at the choice of threading so much music through every episode cheers
IAmA,removed,the wire is my favourite thanks
IAmA,removed,would you rather have your moms meatloaf with macaroni and cheese or something from a nice restaurant
IAmA,removed,hi david i am a huge fan of the wire what is jamie hector like off camera ive seen a lot of the cast in other things and most of them seemed to have a humorous side but marlo just seemed so ruthless and serious of the time how was outside of the show
IAmA,removed,invest in me and ill bring this upcoming generation free energy ive studied all elements that can corelate to revolutionary methods of combustion and eliminate it completely we can run on the power of the earths core invest in me
IAmA,removed,hi mr simon big fan of youre work we even run a podcast about the wire called the shotgun and the briefcase im wondering if you feel frustrations at the way your material is interpreted and if you have a short hypothesis about the potential of tv as an art form i have a million more but ill leave it at that thank you
IAmA,removed,no question just wanted to say thanks for making treme
IAmA,removed,love you david thanks for making my life so much better

IAmA,removed,this is completely silly but it might tickle you i used to work for a small publishing company in london and when the company secretary the money guy would decide to do a grand tour of the office departments my boss would be like walking to alert us to be on best behaviour ie get off facebook
IAmA,removed,missed this by an hour or two i bet and im in the middle of watching the wire for the umpteenth time dangit

IAmA,removed,hey i enjoy joking hazard thanks for making it
IAmA,removed,looks underwhelming
IAmA,removed,was the idea for the game your own and if so what made you think that a survival game would do well in a market that is quite frankly over saturated with similar games at the moment not having a dig but doing market research related stuff at college at the moment and were always told to look at gaps in the market thanks
IAmA,removed,how do we know that this wont be in early access for years like dayz and still be a shit show
IAmA,removed,ur a fucking cunt gabi kill urself
IAmA,removed,animated and scale genitals but no beards
IAmA,removed,good ama
IAmA,removed,have you ever urinated on a homeless man while they were passed out
IAmA,removed,and then a friend in costa rica did it and the police were really impressed that someone was using their time and money to do something so nice just like anything it totally depends on the officers
IAmA,removed,more like a bullet in their skull would do the trick make eugenics great again
IAmA,removed,til in is a low risk cdc estimates that each year roughly in americans or million people gets sick are hospitalized and die of foodborne diseases limiting someones ability to give food the most basic gesture of human kindness cant and shouldnt be regulated id consider caring for anothers health and well being to be the most one of the most basic gestures of human kindness rather than potentially poisoning these people that have extremely limited access to medical careproper shelter whether that be with spoiledinproperly handle food cross contamination or a myriad of other potential issues for people that do hold or have once held these licenses and certifications they should have an understanding of their importance
IAmA,removed,your post has been on the front page so long you either paid for it or have connections
IAmA,removed,here in the city of brotherly love philadelphia pa it is illegal to feed the homeless and the city of philadelphia says they dont really have a homeless problem because there is only has about homeless thats bullshit theres way over here
IAmA,removed,im glad you were arrested its not your place to come into a community you arent involved with and give out free food why how could i be such an animal because youre not a humanitarian for going into someone elses neighborhood and giving out food and then go back to your safe house in some suburb try living in an area that draws homeless people in because of the free services that are provided theres reasons you were arrested you cant possibly imagine ive lived here years now and we do our best as a community to work with these providers that provide free services to homeless to create a safe space for all of us you on the other than just came in an through a wrench into a complex problem that you dont understand and are whiny on facebook let me explain as a community we can only offer so many free services and food in city parks for a certain period of time before their is a breaking or boiling point the biggest thing to understand is that with free food and donations comes homeless and with homeless comes drug dealers dont be blind and think all homeless are just down on their luck they arent some are but most arent so when you create events that give out donations you have to be able to handle the consequences thats why you arrested after the boiling point is reached the homeless have a cycle where they come to your area where your giving handouts and vandalize and steal recently its been upgraded to murder and suicide by cop so theres a balance you have to create when feeding homeless so is giving food to homeless every week worth someone getting mugged yes and no mostly no thats why the neighborhood associations work with aid groups to create a safe space for everyone thats why theres laws against what you did thats why you were arrested you probably dont have homeless where you live put up a sign in front of your house that says youll make soup every wednesday for homeless youll eventually have homeless and eventually youll understand what i mean or youll be arrested and sued by your neighborhoodhomeownerscommunity association if you want to give your time or money to organizations that give free food theres plenty of places you can volunteer for
IAmA,removed,i should not have sorted by controversial
IAmA,removed,media says tampa food not bombs didnt ask for permission from the city or didnt have it
IAmA,removed,good for you we all need to be willing to take on some discomfort for what we believe in
IAmA,removed,ive been given trouble in miami for handing out lunchable packs in the park

IAmA,removed,questions thatll be ignored or glossed over julian doesnt want a trip to siberia
IAmA,removed,wya
IAmA,removed,assangedeadquestionmark
IAmA,removed,you are my hero okay has donald trump contacted you regarding your status as a wanted criminal if not do you think mr trump will free you or not youre a hero mr assange keep up the good work maybe you know or not but during your internet blackout many people were concerned about your disappearence myself included stay safe
IAmA,removed,dude you need to chill
IAmA,removed,why do you believe you are still relevant in
IAmA,removed,why are you such a destructive twatblister
IAmA,removed,turn up the volume
IAmA,removed,the whole fucking thing stinks to high heaven i may be wrong and he may be blameless but he has publically lain down with dogs he is forever tainted
IAmA,removed,you seem to be so focused on outcomes and tribal spirit that you appear to have lost sight of the principle
IAmA,removed,partisan that word means the opposite of what i think you intend it means biased towards one side i presume you meant nonpartisan or better still impartial
IAmA,removed,how does putins cock taste in your mouth
IAmA,removed,this is as disappointing as woody harrelsons one
IAmA,removed,how does trumps dong taste in your mouth
IAmA,removed,and wikilieaks did too what the fuck
IAmA,removed,i love you assange
IAmA,removed,why is your face so shiny does monsato not like you because you stole a massive drum of high fructose corn syrup to smear on your disgusting dirty face
IAmA,removed,people reportedly witnessing a forced abduction at the embassy got a link to anything at all about that other than an ambiguous photo of an armed plainclothes cop sitting outside the embassy in a car as they do outside pretty much all embassies in london the whole thing sounded like something that could only have been conceived by someone who doesnt know london preposterous if you actually know where the embassy is however im prepared to have my mind changed with evidence
IAmA,removed,oh you know the donald hes as nutty as a fruitcake as it is you dont need any help from lil old me to see how zany he is a tenuous excuse that sounds like something written by someone with a wish for trump to get into power but with no loyalty thereto
IAmA,removed,why arent people taking pizzagate more seriously it shows how the jews really feel about the goyim is that why
IAmA,removed,uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper uuuuhh residentsleeper
IAmA,removed,julian assange amaiwna ask me anything and i will not answer
IAmA,removed,how does it feel when putin bangs your facehole
IAmA,removed,remind me hours
IAmA,removed,why are you the biggest piece of sht on earth asking for america
IAmA,removed,how deep does putins dick go inside your asshole sorry my post got removed for not being a question
IAmA,removed,can someone please post the transcripts for all the questions he answerscant access twitch from work thanks in advance
IAmA,removed,john podesta is an evil bitch
IAmA,removed,hey you wet daterape of a person why do you enjoy being the piece of shit shitstain that insists that the world pay attention to your point of view as fact when it really is only your version of the truth i personally believe that you should be stood up in front of the populace of whatever town your coward ass has fled to and beaten within an inch of your life fuck i would do it if i could get my hands on you your idea of what the world should be like and how the world is are vastly ridiculous and your little personal vendetta against people is sickening and i hope you get syphilis shot in the face and have a permanent migraine headache fuck you and your traitorous friends asshole
IAmA,removed,man you guys he was probably expecting light hearted softball questions mr assange what would you rather fight a duck sized putin or an obama sized duck
IAmA,removed,i am curious as to the origin and relevance of this email are we on the verge of a space battle
IAmA,removed,mods what is going on assange why wont you state that you are alive and well and in no serious harm the current date and time something unique that happened in the news yesterday january this nonce value i ask that all redditors take screenshots and sums of this post and julians reply in the perhaps likely event that either of these posts are modified by reddit admins
IAmA,removed,this ama already feels like a joke and it hasnt even begun of the top questions seem like they are generated from propaganda bots peddling a distorted narrative russia hacking trump bias etc weve known for a while that reddit has been thoroughly compromised and if ja doesnt answer sufficiently we will know for certain that wikileaks has been too there also seems to be an ongoing effort by the paid trolls to massively downvote questions about and assanges curious statement that he was annoyed at those seeking to find out the details surrounding the coverup regarding the attacks on that day i think its somewhat strange that a person so heavily involved in exposing government secrets can be so oblivious to the most obvious con job out there then again i have seen people perform all sorts of tricks on their brain to find explanations that make them feel more comfortable with life just doesnt seem like assange would by the type to do that my question have you been following the recent revelations surrounding the discovery of underground tunnels connected to the dnc pedophile ring that is being exposed thanks to emails from john podesta leaked by wikileaks
IAmA,removed,julian assange ama without a single post from julian assange
IAmA,removed,dont forget wikileaks twitter page sold anti hillary shirts on twitter account retweet and linking trumps tweets has tweets like this will russia and us align against china under trump china has pop and gdp of russia with which it shares a border has a show on rt russias state sponsored media only releasing hacked materials from the dnc and yet claiming that theres nothing interesting on the rnc side the bias is blatant and yet he claims to be unbiased
IAmA,removed,please leak something on mexican government its time to make méxico great again also
IAmA,removed,proof of life or i dont believe anything
IAmA,removed,questions whats the bestcase scenario for you exiting the embassy and returning to the real world there have been calls on various subs here for trump to pardon you and snowden but there are certainly lingering risks and other international pressures aside from spreading information from and donating to wl how can your supporters abroad best advocate for your wellbeing and release from detainment is petitioning a trump presidency for a pardon desirable
IAmA,removed,how many times have you given oral fellatio to vladimir putin and how much money did he pay you
IAmA,removed,why havent you offed yourself
IAmA,removed,julianassange is an nwo agent
IAmA,removed,remember folks change redditcomr to cedditcomr to read the deleted comments
IAmA,removed,actually the speculation is that rwikileaks is no longer controlled by assange at all
IAmA,removed,pretty fucking useless to have this as a reddit ama when hes answering via twitch
IAmA,removed,averaging questions a minute in a hour old ama how do you feel about that i bet you feel really important
IAmA,removed,twice
IAmA,removed,what does putins dick taste like

IAmA,removed,anyone notice that pretty much every highly upvoted comment deals almost exclusively with things that defame or otherwise tarnish wikileaks reputation smells fishy
IAmA,removed,are you there
IAmA,removed,and thats the end
IAmA,removed,yes or no
IAmA,removed,what the fuck was that
IAmA,removed,you must be very happy with the trump victory right yfpos

IAmA,removed,sieg heil viktoria
IAmA,removed,julian assange is a attention whore that fears to become irrelevant he kinda is already fuck him and his worthless pseudo answers
IAmA,removed,questions for mods how will we see the transcriptions when theyd be competing against posts like upvotes will there be transcriptions other than assanges own easiest to read transcriptions
IAmA,removed,hi julian how can you be confined at thousands of kilometers from vladimir putin and still manage to suck his cock like theres nothing else in the world when will this generation of fascists of the world roll out the fancy uniforms and where will the wikileaks logo be in them
IAmA,removed,do you and trump share your rape victims
IAmA,removed,partial recording on youtube twitch by default doesnt store records of streams but this can easily be done by users so we have to hope either wikileaks or some attentive redditors uploads the whole video
IAmA,removed,as another russian said one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic people wont give a shit about thousands of faceless people fighting a war but someone weve seen the face of hear speak and listened to for months dying would leave an impact julian even said the outcry over his power shut off was a factor in restoring it
IAmA,removed,how can you sleep at night knowing you helped a fascit piece of shit get elected
IAmA,removed,hey julian when are you going to admit that youre a fucking traitor a rapist and a gimp for the russian government
IAmA,removed,how does putins dick taste
IAmA,removed,heres a sneak peek of using the of all time httpwwwdivinedominoescomimagesstrangeomgpizzaconespng im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
IAmA,removed,kys fam
IAmA,removed,julian nows my chance to explain my vague behavior to a large audience hmm what would be a good answer how about some more vague bullshit to layer on top of my already vague bullshit fuck you
IAmA,removed,great only an hour of answering questions and whole minutes of you saying ugh
IAmA,removed,putin grower or shower
IAmA,removed,i must have minimised about questions was any answered

IAmA,removed,damn only hours in and its closed already 😞
IAmA,removed,no text replies what a pile of bullshit wtf gas happened to amas
IAmA,removed,hello so this may be a longer one right now my family runs a cake shop in thailand which used to be sold in malls etc right now its just made to order and we have a small cake studio with skilled workers at our house these days most of our customers are a very niche and rich group of people who order our cakes to their parties our cakes arent the normal ones but is completely customizable we make everything from dicks to golden dragons crafted from chocolate this goes along with our slogan the art you can taste the problem is we want to expand the efficiency because although we get lots of big orders it doesnt always come in daily so obviously theres a situation where our workers are very free causing them to sometimes get very relaxed in completing a job so my mom handed me the task of creating a subbrand with a whole different target now my mother brand cake is obviously very expensive and oldtraditioned what ways fo you reccomend me doing so or do you have anything in mind my idea was to maybe differentiate the two brands the original one selling the concept the art the experience but then the subbrand with like a very good looking and delicious cake with a less customizable and not much help with the design so it would be way cheaper therefore more smaller orders for marketing im planning on going on social media and doing maybe short videos of cool cake decorations and some celebrity endorsements just want you twoscents on what you think i should do
IAmA,removed,whats it like knowing youve completely screwed over the american people by selling out to putin and getting donald elected over hillary youre a dirty no good limey piece of shit and i hope you get shot on the street
IAmA,removed,hi your post has been removed because you have not provided adequate proof within a reasonable amount of time please see the riama sidebar for posting guidelines thank you please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,removed,go fuck yourself julian how does that sound you and your whole organization are a bunch of scumbag narcissistic scam artists who personally helped elect a an unfit potus you will never be credible in my eyes

IAmA,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuaxkwlbotxkfeatureyoutube im currently uploading the video on youtube ive normalized the audio at the beginning bit and cut out the empty parts i know some of my friends cant use twitch because of their poor internet so just in case the video should be available in a little bit
IAmA,removed,as this ama is over what is the point of saying all comments must contain a question it seems to me this rule along with the threat of banning anyone who doesnt ask a question is simply closing down further discussion where should someone go if they wished to discuss what happened
IAmA,removed,upvoted why are libshits so triggered
IAmA,removed,this ama is a disaster can we safely assume that julian is compromised
IAmA,removed,how does donald trumps dick taste
IAmA,removed,why are you such a fucking twat how many times a day does vladimir putin jizz down your throat

IAmA,removed,kys
IAmA,removed,ujulianassange theres a theory wikileaks is ctrld by the fsbsvr and are useful idiots whose dissent is being capitalized on nytimes huge story httpswwwrtcomnewsassangewikileaksrussianvisa best theory breakdowns wl threatens to leak russian info in octnov reddit had huge thread on it httpsnpredditcomrworldnewscommentsdwolwwikileaksreadytodropabombshellonrussiabut moscow sent very serious threats to wl and they havent said a single bad word about russia since so far russia has had no official response but on wednesday an official at the center for information security of the fsb russias secret police gave a warning to wikileaks that showed none of the tact of the us reply to the iraq revelations its essential to remember that given the will and the relevant orders can be made inaccessible forever the anonymous official told the independent russian news website lifenews did wikileaks get cold feet wl never hesitates to embarrass nato countries what changed in why in dec did medvedev suggest assange be nominated a nobel prize httpsenwikipediaorgwikireceptionofwikileaksrussia reddit had a thread on this public and nongovernmental organisations should think of how to help him the source from inside president dmitry medvedevs office told russian news agencies speaking in brussels where medvedev was attending a russiaeu summit yesterday the source went on maybe nominate him as a nobel prize laureate ever wondered howwhy assange got a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiworldtomorrow in after he threatened to expose russian secret documents how did assange have connections to house snowden in russia was wl started as a russian op i say no has it become one looks that way even the saudi leaks are looking a little more suspicious httpwwwnewsbredcomshiasunniangleindiaandwikileaks saudis are a western ally iran is prorussia look at the bw russia and ksa who leaked tpp who is tpp not including russia china who leaked the sony pictures files wl theres a consistent antiwestern tint here why did wl post how cia spies travel boris nemtsov met an ambassador on russiaus ties wl reveals it then assassinated years later malware servers from dnc hack linked to bundestag hack via russian intel there are httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphilipagee vibes from assangewikileakssnowden wl doxxed john brennans family wl anon twitter accts infighting over wl constant support for antiwestern talking points anon accts shames wl for this tweet anon retweets suggesting that wikileaks toes a distinctly prokremlin line fmr wl worker daniel domscheitberg fell out w assange had problem w the only antiwestern views wl scrubbed docs assange protege sigurdur thordarson was an fbi informant thordarson accosts assange wl fights for justice but still the editor in chief of wl is running from justice for those women in sweden hes breaking laws by breaking hes bail condition wl claim they have no polticial ties to any governmentor political party and im not saying they do but it is strange that wikileaks hosts an tv show on russia today which is operated by money from the russian federation and still no files about russia has been reveled nor ecuador or venezuela wl has published information some here say that documents revealed by wl showed war crimes that it self is partly true of the data that wikileaks has published such as the iraq and afghan war logs diplomatic cables dont show anything illegal or wrong doing the rest maby of that show something thats illegal the rest might show some wrongdoing perhaps not illegal so yeah what bradley manning did was illegal that cant be debated did he get the treatment he deserved hell no should he have been charged like he was yes why he revelaed hundreds of thousunds of classified information that did nothing but embarress the us if he would have leaked only information that showed act of war crimes then i dont think he would be in the some positions as he is in today but though getting a sentance from years to years roughly fmr wl worker finds ties w the russians suspicious why did snowden say this when he got asylum httpswikileaksorgstatementbyedwardsnowdentohtml yet even in the face of this historically disproportionate aggression countries around the world have offered support and asylum these nations including russia venezuela bolivia nicaragua and ecuador have my gratitude and respect for being the first to stand against human rights violations carried out by the powerful rather than the powerless by refusing to compromise their principles in the face of intimidation they have earned the respect of the world it is my intention to travel to each of these countries to extend my personal thanks to their people and leaders russia venezuela bolivia nicaragua ecuador bastions of freedom one of the first stories about the nsa docs didnt come from greenwaldpoitras but his campaign about domestic intelligence integrity started by revealing chinese espionage cia agent bob baer inspiration for syriana collusion w rt wl stories dhs and odni if wl is getting info they dont share they lie about their mission if wl is a russian intel front they get free intel from leakers whistleblowers under the guise that wl will help them but hoard it instead wl is allowed to curate disinformation via edited docs fake narratives wo context under the guise of journalism if wl was honest about bias no one would debate wl as an objective source of info they filter the narrative they want to push always ask what do they have to gain from sharing this info with you no one is unbiased but what wikileaks is choosing to omit is equally important

IAmA,removed,given whats happened with obama over the last years making grand propositions that were churned over and disregarded by an unsupportive congress do you actually think trump will get any of his goals accomplished i mean obama at least had the ds on his side trump has repelled people of both parties my follow up question to that would be what is it that you think trump will accomplish that would not be accomplished by hillary or other
IAmA,removed,just why
IAmA,removed,hm science brought us lobotomies eugenics and nuclear weapons which were then used unnecessarily in one of the most grotesque war crimes in history josef mengeles experiments were at the very least scientific science has been used to make cluster bombs land mines dum dum bullets and has been utilized to most effectively torture people scientists invented heroin as a nonaddictive alternative to morphine fracking which is destroying our groundwater almost everywhere and causing earthquakes in otherwise seismically stable places like oklahoma was invented by scientists your kind of science is why a green party exists why environmental activism e its and is literally responsible for every single instance of environmental destruction on earth you are the problem your way of thinking is deadly people like you have been running the show for generations and are destroying life on earth so forgive me if i invite you to go literally jump off a cliff chop off your balls and do not reproduce more of your science and humanity will be gone along with countless other species from this mass extinction your people have brought down upon your heads
IAmA,removed,i have medicinal cumshots one of the conditions for which my loads have been valuable in treating is scoliosis would you like to try one of my massive medicinal loads
IAmA,removed,many congratulations on becoming a published author very few people can say that well done i dont really have a question just congratulations really
IAmA,removed,my new wife has scoliosis what should i expect going into the future and how can i best support her
IAmA,removed,i was diagnosed with scoliosis at the age of and have been told by the doctor that its at around degrees which is considered severe ive had pains come and go the most specific ones being when id lay down and feel like i laid down at a bad angle or on an uncomfortable bed and have these insanely sharp spikes in pain id need about minutes to recover aside from those though which hasnt happened to me in the past months now and even then it only happened because i was on a very uncomfortable motel bed i dont really experience pain i may just be one of those people whos dealt with the feeling i never make a deal out of it when im experiencing pain in general unless its severe i never had scoliosis surgery but naturally the doctor i spoke to told me it was vital as i could have impairment as youve described where the curvature could grow into my lungs which it hasnt im years old now and im thinking of going for the surgery but its more so as a precaution than it is because i need it im still young enough to be able to recover in a reasonable time and i plan on moving out and living in a new city in so i feel it would be the best time to get it but what has me worried is all of these horror stories and comments about chronic pain which are things im not experiencing my fear is that the surgery will mess me up when i personally never felt like i needed it aside from cosmetic reasons because of my scoliosis i want to focus my phd topic on it specifically looking at nonsurgical solutions to scoliosis for those in the degree range i wanted to hear your input on my situation as clearly you have a lot of experience with spinal deformity and the processes one goes through postsurgery i may also be interested in having you as a contact for future reference if thats ok with you ill be meeting with the same doctor i spoke to when i was as im told hes one of the best surgeons in ontario

IAmA,removed,mr seinfeld seinfeld is my favorite tv show of all time i have cystic fibrosis and many has been the night alone in the hospital where all i had was seinfeld and it brought a smile to my face i cant count how many times ive watched the entire show and i even own the leather bound dvd collection i just wanted to thank you for bringing so much joy into my life it seems so silly but your tv show has actually made a positive impact on my life thank you
IAmA,removed,hey jerry this isnt really a question but i just wanted to say thank you a few years back i was suffering from an undiagnosed stomach problem which caused me to feel as if i were on the verge of vomiting i stopped talking to all my friends going out on weekends and fell into a deep depression but while i watched seinfeld i wouldnt think about the pain it was the only time that i actually wanted to be alive so again thank you i know im a little late so chances are this will get buried but regardless i got it off my chest
IAmA,removed,i dont really have a question i just wanted to say thanks for molding my childhood and my sense of humor when seinfeld came on tv at night my mom would already have us in bed but i would sneak out i was maybe or laying on the floor next to the couch where she couldnt see watching you guys i obviously didnt get a lot of the humor at that age but i still loved it the older i got the more ingenious it became to me and ill always have those memories of hearing my mom crack up for a solid min a night while hiding right next to her so thanks
IAmA,removed,yeah well this aint tv this is real life and these are people talking maybe jerry lives his life up in the clouds and cant comprehend this money does leave you detached from reality

IAmA,removed,oh you left the sect no question just congratulations leah watching king of queens with my family is a very fond memory of mine
IAmA,removed,why were you dumb enough to join the cult of scientology in the first place
IAmA,removed,scientology is for idiots and the weak minded they get brainwashed n then they mad dont get mad at a cult for doing its job you the idiot who signed up just the concept of scientology is stupid no one cares if u got brain washed theres other stuff out there more important then u
IAmA,removed,leah i know you joined scientology alongside your mother how do your other family members feel about your involvement and now you speaking out against scientology which relationship of yours has this impacted the most either negatively or positively
IAmA,removed,leah i cant begin to express how much respect you are owed for your courage to do what youve done when every aspect of your life except of course those aspects that really matter would have been so much easier if you had just kept your head down please keep fighting the good fight and showing the world that scientology itself not its critics needs to be httpsenwikipediaorgwikifairgamescientology do you have a rough idea of what impact you might have had so far on scientology how many people have left it stopped the process of entering it or even avoided it entirely because of your example do you think scientology might someday be forced into a more innocuous organization by the spotlight that you and others are bringing onto its draconian practices as an aside ive loved you ever since cheers norm once asked carla how her kids were and she said two are ugly ones obnoxious and ones just stupid hes my favorite thanks for being the obnoxious one
IAmA,removed,scrohawk point minutes ago leah i was tcs roommate back in the early i always suspected that my scn friends did not want me to live with her because she was also considered a troublemaker and i was newish to the cult i always suspected that she had her doubts but never felt comfortable enough to talk to her about it i saw her on your show and was able to reach out to her and be candid with her finally after years from the bottom of my heart thank you for doing this and for speaking out just like lrh wanted to use celebrities to bolster the image of scientology it will take celebrities to bring it down as well keep it up question are you still being harassed on a daily basis
IAmA,removed,please give us a list of the celebrities youve seen naked and a detailed description of the good stuff
IAmA,removed,im really happy this got to the front page so quickly
IAmA,removed,nice to see youre still hot no further questions
IAmA,removed,you go leah
IAmA,removed,hi leah feel free not to respond considering my question isnt about scientology but im curious if there are any plans for you to make an appearance in kevin can wait you and kevin james have great chemistry and make a good comedic team i miss seeing both of you on the king of queens
IAmA,removed,its been made public that a lot of government on all levels cops judges politicians are in the pocket of the cos with that said please hire private security theres a lot of people myself included that would do everything in their power to make sure you stay safe in this crazy fucking world you are an inspiration for people i hope you stay safe
IAmA,removed,what in your opinion is the churchs strongest appeal and how you would negate that appeal for would be members
IAmA,removed,did you ever actually believe their doctrine
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,btw youve been my crush since i was about watching sbtb and then in high school when you were on king of queens and youre still as stunning as ever
IAmA,removed,leah you were my first lesbian crush and i was extremely saddened to find out you were a scientologist im glad youre out of there and thank you so much for your bravery in sharing your experience
IAmA,removed,i remember reading that it was lronhubbard science fiction writer that created scientology is this true
IAmA,removed,i know this is off topic but i watch king of queens almost everyday haha
IAmA,removed,massive props to you leah for standing tall in spite of scientologys smear tactics and lies you give hope to those that dont have a voice inside the walls of their prison may peace and love fill your soul
IAmA,removed,not a question but just wanted to say that i am incredibly proud of you
IAmA,removed,fuck your stupid
IAmA,removed,this isnt really a question as much as it is an observation with all the bad press scientology gets it makes you wonder why theyre still so aggressive in defending their reputationthere must be some worse stuff out there that they dont want getting out
IAmA,removed,hey leah no scientology question just wanted to let you know that ive been a fan since i first saw you in saved by the bell
IAmA,removed,insert tom cruise joke here
IAmA,removed,the only way out is through best wishes

IAmA,removed,please kill yourself
IAmA,removed,damn i love you leah come back to television loml
IAmA,removed,i know nothing about scientology i was told it was more of a cult ps remember saved by the bell lol
IAmA,removed,hi leah i have a waifu pillow with your current headshot glued to it with my stale baby batter ive noticed that since you left the church my ejaculate is more yellowish and i poo blood after i cum also my smeg doesnt smell as bad so just wanted to say i hope to skin you alive and wear your skin like a skirt with my man tackle tucked between my hairy girthy thighs
IAmA,removed,where do you keep the people who wanted to leave
IAmA,removed,not much to ask but my wife is a big fan of yours
IAmA,removed,great to see you guys are doing an ama big follower of and ive read several articles on you guys
IAmA,removed,thank you for making this i look forward to learning more about this cult and i hope that airing this will help expose it to more people so we can see how bad and how damaging this thing is
IAmA,removed,after reading some of your interviews and answers on here idk y but your so much sexier now
IAmA,removed,a new god has risen the shrines to the great lord of lulz have been blasted away along with his adherents philosophy gone are the days of sopa scientology and dusty the cat the anonymous that once stood for freedom of information protection of animals and the pursuit of cheap laughs at the expense of others now stands for the destruction of newmales and cucks opposition to the jooz and cheap laughs at the expense of others lulz has fallen all hail the new god kek there is no lord but kek and trump is his godemperor

IAmA,removed,youre a cuck lord
IAmA,removed,i think you are awesome and i love the autographed picture i got from you i look forward to watching your new show tonight on ae
IAmA,removed,how surprised are you that this cult still exists
IAmA,removed,scientology is a hoax created by the chinese government to take our jobs
IAmA,removed,hi leah my wife and i are huge fans of yours since saved by the bell on my wife told me to ask you if she can be your friend so thats her question she watches your show now and always tells me interesting things about you when i get home from work anyway my question is what was it that made you leave scientology like was it a singular event or the accumulation of several events also do you practice any religion now that you have escaped congrats by the way wishing you and your family very happy holidays thank you
IAmA,removed,this whole thread is annoying people have to be more open minded i am not a scientologist by any means but people there is definitely hypocrisy all over
IAmA,removed,just wanted to say thank you for what you are doing
IAmA,removed,what we now know as the altright started off as a joke we were definitely antipc but we werent actually prohomophobiasexismracism it was and to a lesser extent still is possible to advocate free speech without advocating hate speech we called everyone fags we said there were no women on the internet but it wasnt a pussy pass deniedmra thing it was more about neckbeards pretending to be cheerleaders these were mostly converted to bronies when mlp happened we werent saying fag to be homophobic as evidenced by the presence of such terms as straightfag and gayfag interestingly the altright movement isnt very homophobic because they all own and enjoy dragon dildos and they genuinely abhor hypocrisy unfortunately as time went on people started showing up who actually believed these things and they werent smart enough to get that we were being ironic it also didnt help that we broke sarah silvermans fundamental law of comedy if you tell an ironic racistsexisthomophobic joke and an actual racistetc might laugh at it then your joke isnt ironic youre acutally just being racist eventually fewer and fewer people seemed to understand that it was a joke and by or it was starting to feel like had become an actual hateboard moot created a containment board hoping they would all just stay in pol but the opposite occurred pol attracted more idiots who then flooded all the boards it didnt help that was a completely unsafe place to talk about actual activism so everyone who wanted to do that kind of stuff went elsewhere a lot of is still funny but the closer you get to pol the quality goes down the peak of was the time magazine thing but naturally that attracted a lot more stupid people so it declined fast from there there are still some good boards there but the closer you get to pol the more intolerable it becomes edit since i posted this someone else basically said everything i just said but more succinctly but it took me a long time to write this so im keeping it
IAmA,removed,how about you live in lebanon no church will find you there
IAmA,removed,wow dont have a question you always made me laugh thanks for that hope everything goes well leah
IAmA,removed,stacey carosi kelly kapowski
IAmA,removed,i hope you can go back to visit your pals at howard stern i saw your old scientology ball breaker interview that was fun i just wrote this for nothing because youll likely not read it out of these thousands of comments oh well
IAmA,removed,no questions just want to say you seem like an awesome person and also your nails look really sharp
IAmA,removed,i live very close to the gold base in california what goes on there its really a weird place
IAmA,removed,i just want to say i was disappointed when i heard you were a scientologist but happy to hear you got away from those whack jobs
IAmA,removed,so weird i just found out yesterday that a good family friend is having their story about their brother featured on the show i totally support and appreciate what youre doing
IAmA,removed,what appealed to you the most about the church what made you give so much money to then
IAmA,removed,hi leah
IAmA,removed,just tell the truth that scientology is a joke religion all you do is pay money to a bunch of scam artist and idiots like you fall for it its a worthless religion instead of giving that garbage your money why dont you give it to things that truly matter like cancer research
IAmA,removed,im a former scientologist and sea org member i was raised in scn and joined the so as a girl and was in for six years im still dealing with the effects of the abuse i endured in the so i just want to say thank you for being brave and outspoken i feel like even when people are rightly negative about scn they still dont really get it and its difficult to talk about so thank you for doing what youre doing and for being an example for someone that gets it
IAmA,removed,exactly you voted for trump because its best for your family not even considering anyone else i wonder who has there head in the sand if you really think everyone has their hands in your pockets then take them out stand up and fucking do something rather than hding behind a candidate that you think will magically make itll better your in america dont fucking tell me you couldnt be doing more you have opportunity you have chances to make your life better no ones coming down on you or anyone else god this whole mentality of the universe is coming down on me is utter bullshit the world is changing adapt or die
IAmA,removed,added twitter to contact
IAmA,removed,i am finding all of this very entertaining
IAmA,removed,you have been a wonderful example to young people who have seen your work thanks for that and its sad you were taken advantage of by the church good for you for doing this ama
IAmA,removed,show us your tits
IAmA,removed,leah will you go on a date with me had to try
IAmA,removed,first ama where i actually read at least of the questionsanswers and forgot about dinner
IAmA,removed,no question and i assume you wont read this but kudos congrats and i wish you the best
IAmA,removed,no question but just wanted to send some love and say thanks for being awesome your videos are incredible
IAmA,removed,i cant be the only one who thinks she looks like the girl from that one show about the couple and the main male character name was doug with the dad living in the basement
IAmA,removed,what is a therapy room
IAmA,removed,so is the alien living inside me cool with maybe leaving on the weekends so i can the place to myself even for a few hours i just need some time to myself
IAmA,removed,more than anything id like to applaud you and thank you for being so brave as to share your story as someone that came out of religion based on the notsogreat morality of the church i was raised in i can appreciate how you feel the need to educate and raise awareness on such a touchy personal topic
IAmA,removed,way late but hopefully you are still here huge fan i am a police officer i hve always wondered if there arewere police officers in scientology who did things that were assisting the church while on duty such as searching databases etc
IAmA,removed,while i dont understand the beliefs of scientology i applaud your battle to do the right thing and shed light on this organization im sure it doesnt make you too popular in your crowd but sometimes the right path isnt the easiest one thank you for being a positive example for others
IAmA,removed,thank you for doing this our families have been friends for years well at least our mothers have good luck tonight you have always been an amazing person and this just shows the world how truly wonderful you are
IAmA,removed,i would like to share my one time experience with scientology a buddy and i were in high school at the time and we decided to go into a scientology church and just ask some questions we simply wanted to understand what it was all about the man we spoke with started out kind nice and open willing to share my buddy was confused at a comment he made and asked for clarity and said he didnt understand at that point the man completely changed his attitude as if he was a different person he began to yell at us and told us to get the fuck out get out you fucking hippie so we left and saw him and some other man watching us leave just glaring at us ive never felt so threatened like that before and we never went back i seriously felt as if he changed completely almost demonic or possessed in a way
IAmA,removed,i didnt really have a question i just wanted to say how much i appreciate your honesty and dedication in this thread you have answered many tough questions and from what i can tell havent dodged anything plus youre like the babe on tv and i watch the reruns daily after work
IAmA,removed,just wanted to offer massive respect anyone who can leave everything they have ever known is a brave brave person the fact that youre exposing the church of scientology is a huge bonus
IAmA,removed,and i thought the bible sounded insane lmfao
IAmA,removed,eh theyll grow up too just like us fogies itll just take longer like i remember the first time i thought hey maybe referring to everyone as a fag isnt quite as harmless as i thought it was for them itll just be something like whoa maybe im not as racist as a real racist or something i dont know
IAmA,removed,we met up at a party once in you allowed me to gush and vomit my adoration for you from way back when you were on living dolls member i loved that episode there you two were standing in the mirror looking at each other and michael learned was all trying to break through your characters tough exterior you literally allowed me to fangirl you for a full minutes then we talked about how to be a mommy and say no when you the milk bottle is right there then i think i played bongos on kimora lee simmons giantbowed bottom which was at my neckand the next thing i knewi was having the first girlfriends gossip session for the first time since i d graduated high school yeah anyway i thought i admired you then girrrrrrrl uhuh aint nothing compared to the amount of respect and awe thats since evolved you keep on keepin on le youre a fucking badass of love

IAmA,removed,youre more of a hack than gary johnson and donald trump neeeeext
IAmA,removed,ill take you on statist scum
IAmA,removed,can i tattoo you or yolandi when you come to the northeast of americas totally free it would be an honour i work in a shop in groton connecticut
IAmA,removed,hello you fat depressed diva i just wanted to let you know i binged harmonquest this weekend very good stuff now to convince the rest of the tv execs that we dont pay for tv anymore gogo
IAmA,removed,this isnt a question ayy
IAmA,removed,a stereotype with massive roots in reality not helped by it becoming a gender norm
IAmA,removed,nsfw obviously
IAmA,removed,laverne
IAmA,removed,he literally has a uterus yes structurally has a female body but genetically is male if you have a y chromosome you are male if you lack one you are female this can be corrected with crispr but not hormone therapy or plastic surgery men and women are not the same so its important not to confuse the two brain chemistry is very different
IAmA,removed,lezzie freak is against god
IAmA,removed,hey its nice to see someone talking about this i have a similar issue i too seemed to be a completely normal baby and child until adolescence when i never went through puberty i shuffled around through several doctors and they did a bunch of tests and what they concluded was that i had ovarian agenesis also known as primary ovarian failure they did a karyotype test which came back xx so for some unknown reason i just didnt develop ovaries and an ultrasound showed nothing there it is a pretty depressing diagnosis i found out when i was around or so a little younger than you but we couldnt find the right hormones i took some that made me bleed nonstop while others seemed to have no effect for years i just gave up and didnt bother to take any and now im scared to find out about my bone density when i found out i didnt particularly want children so it didnt feel too bad but now that im older im starting to see the door that was never open to me might have been one i would have wanted to pass through after all ive pretty much accepted it at this point because what else can i do of course there are options like adoption fostering and donor eggs but all of that is so much more difficulthassle than just fucking and conceiving a baby the boob thing is really depressing to me i dont know if i wasnt early enough with the hormones or what but mine are small and misshapen eventually im probably going to have surgery because fuck it im not going to live my whole life with gross boobs im also taller than anyone else in my family and just big just largeboned i used to be super fat too but once i started taking hormones and some drug called metformin i lost a ton of weight even though im a normal weight now i still remember being a morbidlyobese middle schooler and it hugely affected my confidence and im still tall with broad shoulders although of course i look and feel better than i did when i was so fat its a hard thing to deal with and i have a really difficult time discussing it with anyone i told my best friend in high school but i havent told anyone since then and ive never known how to approach the topic with a boyfriend so ive never gotten too far into a relationship because how and when do you tell them that you cant have kids its not exactly first date material but you also dont want to wait until the point when theyre thinking about proposing before saying oh by the way i cant have your babies lol
IAmA,removed,he still has a y chromosome he is still male
IAmA,removed,its reasonable if you dont know to assume you are what your physical features would suggest you are but they know better theyre aware of the fact they have a y chromosome and are actually male
IAmA,removed,what kind of porn do you watch
IAmA,removed,it has nothing to do with genetic purity if they want to be a woman they would need to modify their sex chromosomes to do so as it stands this individual has a y sex chromosome and is thus male
IAmA,removed,youre making more out of this than you should none of what you suggested about me is true but even if it were it does not change the facts of the issue the individual has a y sex chromosome he is a male
IAmA,removed,truth menwomen ill never understand the idiots who say everyone is biballs or bustman
IAmA,removed,if you have xy chromosomes youre a man not a lady why do you think youre a women when you clearly are not
IAmA,removed,like fuck off
IAmA,removed,this individuals life will likely never have an effect on me outside of these conversations legally genetically they are male were a blood test to be done on them they would come up definitively as male for all intents and purposes their brain chemistry is still that of a male males and females are not the same a chromosome alteration would make it so that they were genetically similar to the way their body developed and perhaps also modify their brain chemistry to that of a females
IAmA,removed,what a vile human being you are
IAmA,removed,what about xxyy its not difficult if you have a y chromosome you are male if you lack one you are female dna testing is fairly standard for court trials to determine things like paternity
IAmA,removed,ok youre a dumb fat cunt with too much free time and no one who cares if you life or die see im not a hypocrite either
IAmA,removed,yup im op lol check my post history you silly dumb cunt or if you prefer i can pm you the balls im currently scratching
IAmA,removed,your post history is just you antagonizing women in this thread so i ask you who hurt you are you upset because you havent been able to maintain a real relationship and have since concluded that no woman could ever possibly have interests in common with you im assuming youre not that into makeup and celebrities unlike absolutely every woman on the planet of course pm me your balls though
IAmA,removed,what is your opinion on trannies what do you think when transexxuals point to people like you as proof that they should change gender
IAmA,removed,i was really hoping your proof wasnt going to be your ovaries floating in a jar
IAmA,removed,hi randomtimmiesworker your post has been removed because your post has been removed because it lacks adequate proof unfortunately the links or photos youve posted could have been posted by anyone and they dont prove that you are the person doing the ama your proof needs to be something that connects the fact that youre doing an ama with your identity this could be something like a photo of you showing what youre doing the ama about with a sign that has your username and the date it could also be documents partially redacted if desired with a note that has the username and the date please let us know when the proof has been added by replying here and well put the post back up cheers please contact the mods if you need further assistance

IAmA,removed,considering your iqs are probably in the isnt it a waste of time and resources to try to teach you about technology wouldnt you and your communities be better served if you were prepared for a life as a worker and whites and asians came in managed overall the quality of life for you and your community would increase and while youd never be ownership class thats not really the choice the choice is whitesasians build and manage and blacks do the lower level work with of course some iq is a distribution after all working their way up but upper management largely consisting of whites and asians i mean ghanas average iq is the average world iq is and the average college grad iq is i know that the us only of the black population is or above but the average black iq in the us is with caucasian genomes ghana is iq points away from and from the average college grad only of us blacks have iqs of or above thats a point difference so we can roughly estimate that only of ghanans lets just say are even average wouldnt the most efficient program with the highest benefits be country wide iq screening and moving of high iq ghanans into special schools where a stem education isnt a waste of time a breeding program where ghanan women are impregnated by jewschinese and other high iq individuals to change the intelligence make up of the country over generations sterilization of the lowest iq ghanans maybe even the bottom asians and europeans taking control of industry in ghana in a sort of lease agreement for the next generation or two before can really take effect here essentially these foreign born entrepreneurs wouldnt retain ownership of their ventures the ownership would revert back to the workers over time or you can go for option b try to teach a bunch of borderline retards concepts theyll never grasp so that you can feel good about yourself

IAmA,removed,my company would ask that i avoid public proof but i promise the mods have it instantly lost interest
IAmA,removed,just a little tip for those who have ongoing bedbug problems proper identification of the bedbug is essential there is a bug that looks similar but is identifiable under a microscope there have been cases when bedbugs have turned out to be bat bugs which look almost the same and are carried on the bodies and in areas of bat harborage if you are getting treated for bedbugs on the top floor of the house and bedbugs are being found up along the top of the walls toward the ceiling it may be bat bugs it isnt very common but elimination of the bugs will not happen until bs activity is dealt with

IAmA,removed,people of all nations rich or poor will have to face the great waves of change the condition of the world now is so degraded that humanitys future is in grave doubt but who can see this except those who have clear eyes and understand the balance of life in this world those who are not overtaken with greed and consumption those who can see the limits of technology and the limits of power the state of the world httpwwwnewmessageorg httpwwwnewmessageorgsteps httpwwwgreatwavesofchangeorg httpwwwnewmessageorgthenightmeditation free guided meditation of stillness knowledge and grace how do you really feel inside about the future of our planet and our human family how do you really feel at a deeper experiential level about the future of your own life and the future of your family and community and nation be honest you may want to log your responses in your journal insight log and continue to ask and be with the questions what else in the world could possibly be able to help us really see this earth in great environmental climate and energy resources permeant states of decline and really know what this means and what else could simultaneously see the clever groups of intervention by et from beyond our solar system so clearly and state how we each must prepare with knowledge and discernment within to encounter races with far more impact in the mental environment to shape human perception influence human conflict and values long term given this who else but god could even begin to prepare humanity for such unprecedented great waves of change both of which are converging now the people who have the patience to experience and actually apply themselves to the daily steps to knowledge pathway httpwwwnewmessageorgsteps and to build their inner connection with knowledge and the mystery and presence in their lives will be most able to objectively recognize beyond conditioning ideas belief or emotions and fear what must be done step by step to prepare each day to not only get through the great waves of change but to be of great service to other people in need for the stability of their civilization their communities their families and themselves pages of a new message from god revealed over a year period show that this is indeed the case for those with clear eyes and open minds and open hearts who have the ability to see know and act upon the truth the ability to see the truth to know the truth and to act upon the truth represents the great strength of every human this is the deeper spiritual intelligence of knowledge within you and every human alive now humanity has not lost its connection and response to knowledge within yet but the danger of doing so grows with each passing day as humanity becomes seduced by mistress of technology as a false savior to overcome the destruction of nature and the natural environment the httpwwwnewmessageorg is here to prepare humanity one individual at a time to see the great warning blessing and need for preparation of our times most of the preparation is internal reconnecting with knowledge within powerfully daily in simple to understand yet very effective steps to knowledge practices this return to ourselves through knowledge is necessary it has always been necessary that is why successive messages from god have been delivered with the reclamation of knowledge still today being the core of all religions spiritual pathways throughout history at critical turning points such as living in a planet in great decline look at the world the surface intellect has created what do you see and feel really a world of deprivation war destruction of the environment and exploitation of every aspect of the planet and each other as another means to make our separation from god less awful usually at the expense of others and the destruction of the soil water and species we put extinct per day every day for the last years i dont feel with any certainty that the surface intellect the superficial mind created by each of us being in the world can get us out of the very mess the surface intellect has got us into on this planet we cannot go to other planets after we ruin this one for our kids beyond our solar system all other planets and territories are controlled used by other races einstein said we cannot possibly solve the problems of the world and future using the same level of consciousness that we have in the past i feel that it is only by reentering relationship with knowledge the deeper spiritual intelligence god put within each one of us at birth that we will each be able to face and prepare for the very uncertain future ahead knowledge as i understand the new message to say is the most natural deepest experience of relationship and connection that everyone of us has had and continues to have every moment throughout life knowledge within you and within every human here was put within each of us to serve a specific contribution to a planet and a race in need we cannot find and live and respond to knowledge alone in this knowledge brings unity cooperation peacemaking real healing from millennia of traumas of abuse deprivation and war that nothing else could do and what corner of the planet does not need this healing from trauma and dissociation from our deeper spiritual experience of knowledge and from god and from each other now i have a baseline ongoing experience that mysteriously this is part why i have come into the world at this time and i have been feeling the great waves of change for many years as part of this experience the world has entered a state of permanent decline now it is a race to save human civilization and the stability it provides to billions every single day the question is can we all respond as powerfully to the experience guidance and next steps presented by knowledge as marshall has or will humanity run the earth into the ground in wars of desperation over the last remaining pockets of water food production and natural resources left on the planet

IAmA,removed,love your show the thing that hit me the most in the numerous episodes of parts unknown or no reservations was you were in libya i think and went to a bbq on the coast it was in a bombed out house with nothing else but four walls some food cooking on a fire and blankets laid out for people to sit on there were people laughing and having a good time they had fought for the freedom to just be able to have that bbq with friends that really hit me we take so much for granted that they would lay down their lives just to have the freedom to do that amazing

IAmA,removed,hey anthony im a really big fan of your show and have watched many seasons however i really did not enjoy your portrayal of romania and dont think you got a genuine experience of the country first of all your friend and guide was some russian guy who didnt have any tangency to romanian culture or speak the language therefore you didnt have a chance to experience the rich history and cultural heritage present throughout the country overall your portrayal of romania as a bleak touristy and underwhelming place is completely unfounded and i urge you to travel there again in order to change your mind

IAmA,removed,how many bombs do you carry when are you going to detonate them
IAmA,removed,stop focussing on terrorist activities maybe ill see myself out
IAmA,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

IAmA,removed,the biggest problem i had with the concept of your goku vs superman battles was the inclusion of supermanprimesuperboyprime into the calculations supermanprime isnt mainstream superman so im not sure why he was factored in i think a proper rematch would be strictly the httpdcwikiacomwikikalelprimeearth vs dbs goku rather than what appeared to be some odd amalgamations of both

IAmA,removed,i regret not having an exit strategy after legalization i wouldve left alaska soon had i known the backlash that was brewing but quitting accomplished its goal get the attention of alaskan voters to legalize adult use of marijuana so no i wouldnt change how i quit just the follow through
IAmA,removed,that marijuana is the most miraculous plant on the face of the planet its truly a gift i cant tell you how mind blowing it is to watch someone get a second chance at life because they ingested a plant im talking children with severe seizure disorders that instantly stop seizing when cannabis oil is applied to the soles of their feet or to watch the hands of someone with parkinsons calm seconds after smoking a simple joint its such a blessing to so many people it has the power to do so much good its on us to fight to allow it to serve its purpose thats what i do
IAmA,removed,where to begin i didnt i didnt i didnt i dont theyre completely different situations i dont they were he never did people grow apart i dont tell anyone that
IAmA,removed,get me off of shetland and back for less than a weeks wages
IAmA,removed,were you in the bar or did you just see the photos that my former neighbor the woman i had a restraining order against and had arrested staged for the media what other proof do you have if the place was trashed as such charges or a lawsuit wouldve been filed and you wouldve seen it covered on a reputable news site not some blog run by racists bent on smearing my legacy in your proof there are no threats as you claim no proof of theft no proof of event attendees not receiving their funds youve gathered every possible negative rumor from alaska about me without any regard for the fact that each situation has already been handled so im glad i can put it rest now
IAmA,removed,its so obvious and so doable marijuana reform can help the sick end the wasteful war on drugs that he wreaked havoc on communities of color and poor for generations it can provide economic opportunities to rebuild communities hemp is one of the most versatile renewable resources its important that we leave this world better i live by that philosophy and while i cant fix global warming or rape culture i know that if we stand up and demand cannabis reform it will happen in our lifetime
IAmA,removed,the state of alaska has charged me with felonies and misdemeanors all marijuana possession charges all marijuana in alaska was legalized they chose to use the prelegalization laws to charge me its a political prosecution that could land me in jail for years id appreciate it if youd sign my petition and just share my story what the state of alaska is doing is shameful and the world should know about it
IAmA,removed,in case anyone would like to know this is the woman i had arrested for violating the restraining order against me hi sarha im not interested in engaging with you but youre more than welcome to continue cyber stalking and screenshotting my life
IAmA,removed,its a real threat
IAmA,removed,why are you trolling me
IAmA,removed,hello ill also do my best to help you answer this question i run an identical service for australia and have been very successful with the following methods use googlecomflights i cant stress enough how useful this site is google not only lets you browse flexible dates but they also let you type in broad destinations such as europe instead of paris charles de gaulle airport google also allows you to select a departure airport and view their google maps application with prices by city create an ifttt formula a lot of resources online for this adiosocom is largely popular internationally and allows you to search flexible dates and destinations skyscannercom also lets you search flexible dates at the end of the day my value add for my subscribers is that i dont want them to have to endure the learning curve of opening tabs at once and searching hundreds of cities i do that for them as a shameless plug feel free to visit my site i am also expanding into europe and would love feedback if anyone has it my website httpwwwsweetasflightscom

IAmA,removed,hi i run a similar website to jack and have a personal answer for you there are absolutely costs associated with hosting a website and spending time to find the flights so i try to offset those with a premium subscription for me i pay domain name fees and hosting fees as well as the many hours i spend looking for these flights my free email list sends out about of the amount of emails my premium list sends out if anyone does this fulltime which is pretty much necessary in order to find a good amount of cheap flights then you can expect they will need a revenue source from somewhere i also will never share email lists or credit card information with anyone because thats a quick way to lose subscribers hope that helps answer your question
IAmA,removed,hello i run an identical website as jack and ill try to give an answer to your question in case he doesnt get to it when i am researching for a specific country eg usa australia france i try to omit domestic flights reason being is these fares are extremely volatile and change rather quickly the savings is also on average much lower than international flights when shopping internationally flight tickets tend to remain priced within the same range for quite some time one of the reasons for this is because the large planes they use dont fill up as quickly as the small domestic planes my uk emails include trips across europe but rarelytonever include domestic trips unless i come across a deal too good to pass up
IAmA,removed,is also pretty helpful
IAmA,removed,hello i run an identical website as jack and ill try to give an answer to your question in case he doesnt get to it my site does all of europe us and australia if youd like the link to my site please send me a dm and id be happy to help

IAmA,removed,thanks for doing an ama love the show i actually just started watching last week and couldnt stop until i was caught up i dont really have a question but i wanted to say thank you for the great portrayal of the haughtwaverly relationship so far and for recognizing some lgbtq fans concerns when it comes to what has happened on many previous shows on a show like this i would absolutely never expect any particular character besides wynonna to stay alive for almost the entire run and i certainly wouldnt want anyone else to be automatically safe no matter what but its comforting to at least have one thing to count on through the end of the season especially because nicole is quickly rising on my list of favorite characters its also great to see a show that clearly treats its viewers with respect and i cant wait to see what you guys have in store for the end of the season and hopefully next year too good luck on the season renewal

IAmA,removed,hello fellow uc year old here i find your story is similar to mine in some ways except we took a different route last year back in february i had a flare that lasted until may i lost around lbs in a couple weeks couldnt eat bloody stools etc you know the symptoms haha well anyway i was put on prednisone does that were pretty high for a while but that did nothing i was malnourished sick all the time and just in a shitty situation pun intended we discussed our options and i started tpn to help get my body the nutrients it needed since i was unable to eat and i also had a blood transfusion since my hemoglobin was so low they were really worried about my weight loss as i was blacking out couldnt walk or anything cause of low energy the tpn eventually helped but i was still experiencing my uc symptoms i started infusions of a biologic called remicade and it has completely changed my life since then i started to improve within a month after my first infusion now i get an infusion every weeks and dont have to take any other medicine the only problem was that i was left at lbs and ft tall so i looked like a holocaust survivor basically i had to force my body to want food again this also sparked my interest in weightlifting and i was able to completely change my body i now weigh lbs compared to at my lowest just one year ago i dont really have any questions i just like to meet other people who have gone through something like i have best of luck to you and i hope everything works out if you have any questions about my recovery or anything else just dm me and ill be glad to talk
IAmA,removed,i take care of a lady who has a colostomy bag two tips to make life a little easier and less smelly drop a couple of tic tacs in the bag when you change it it helps with the smell also pam cooking spray in the bag after an empty or a change helps the next poo slide on out
IAmA,removed,you dont know what those words mean obviously it says to ask anything i already know what wwii was like i always wondered how the soldiers felt personally so i asked you are a stupid person who doesnt know what the word anything means
IAmA,removed,no probably nothe has a different condition but he has a podcast about getting colon cancer and was recently able to stop using a colostomy bag
IAmA,removed,a friend of mine went through a similar scenario except he was scared and didnt seek treatment he was in the hospital for nearly months dont wait to get medical attention if something goes awry
IAmA,removed,i dont have a question but as a fellow ostomate i just want to say good luck i also had ulcerative colitis and the surgery is the best thing i ever did
IAmA,removed,man i was diagnosed at age it took several hospitalizations and rounds of solumedrol and prednisone before a doctor put me on remicade as a last ditch effort to avoid colon removal ive been fortunate to achieve remission with dose every weeks over the last years just wanna say good luck with the surgery and im sorry it made its way to that point with you heres hoping many others are able to achieve remission before having to deal with a colostomy at such a young age
IAmA,removed,why not just kill yourself
IAmA,removed,i unlike you dont feel the need to go around harrassing people on the internet about the intent of their posts why waste that kind of time why are you wasting that kind of time why are you wasting my time not my problem youve taken this so seriously bye

IAmA,removed,hey man i want to wish your the best of luck with your surgery i work as a medical illustrator in a patient ed office of a hospital and thought you might also be interested in this material we created last year for ostomy patients it just lays out what to expect with your care and management etc weve had positive feedback with it at the hospital where i work cheers httpmuhcguidescommodulesostomy cheers m

IAmA,removed,you outright lie in your prager university video about the consensus on global warming and httpswwwskepticalsciencecomhulmeipccconsensushtm in reality the consensus is that humans are overwhelmingly the main driver of climate change the natural factors over the same period of time are small and already accounted for and climate models are not only accurate but if anything they have proven to be too conservative about their estimated impacts the only misrepresentation of data is yours despite having zero scientific training you keep making scientific claims like the idea that rising levels will be good for plants despite the significant and measured effects on issues like httpbercberkeleyedudesertificationtheforgottensideofclimatechange you claim to be independent but your think tank is paid speaking fees from the same groups you pretend to be independent from theres no question here but it should be obvious what a joke your claims are not to be confused with an actual university the fact that a conservative youtube channel misrepresents itself and pretends to have academic credibility isnt surprising but it does show the lack of concern for accuracy among the participants other hits from that channel

IAmA,removed,i dont and it never ended up getting published so its gone forever as far as i know i think though i might work on an updated one since i wrote this before one of the better events for showing it off happened ariana miyamotos run as miss japan and i want to be clear that it isnt so much a claim that racism doesnt exist in asia but rather that the framework we use to talk about it is indefensible from an academic standpoint orientalism orientalism is the exaggeration of difference the presumption of western superiority and the application of clichéd analytical models for perceiving the oriental worldshamelessly copied from httpsenwikipediaorgwikiorientalismbookoverview because its a really good explanation i slightly modify it because the subject matter is somewhat different but the general issue is the failure to understand the cultural history of the places or why people are doing what they are doing or what the concerns these people may be acting on are prescriptivism is basically in this case prescribing meaning to something be it an action or a set of rules or whatever oftentimes using a framework in the case of academic work on racism it tends to be modeled on how jim crow and a lesser extent apartheid worked so people will try to explain asian policies as they are racist because of a mixture of things lost in translation and usage of a framework that doesnt really make sense in the location they are talking about

IAmA,removed,kai i have bumped into your posts the last few days and they seem really bizarre first how many different jobs do you have here you say i find a lot of students in my sixth like you are a teacher yet in other posts you share that you are a software developer in enterprise which is it or do you both but the weirder thing is you go on and on how bad google products are here you wrote nothing makes people want a google product more than when its forced down their throat remember all the people who just adored google after they were nagged to giving away their privacy to comment on youtube but then you buy tons and tons of google products everyday this week you have blasted a different google product you purchased here is the blast chromecast day you went on and on about google terms and was downvoted and then came back and delete all your posts why if you hate google products do you keep buying so many only to come on reddit and blast google products maybe if you do not like google why not stop buying them it is very clear you hate google and go on and on about how awful their products but then
IAmA,removed,kai you have now indicated that you are actually not a teacher like you implied but instead was a teacher in the past so that starts to explain why in the last days you have had so many different jobs but still does not explain why you buy so many google products where it is very clear you hate google here you blasted the google chromecast here you blasted google terms but then deleted all the posts after getting deleted why then buy so many google products

IAmA,removed,my sister was struggling to payback her student loan debt she never graduated and is underemployed living in a rural area i didnt want her to have bad credit and a crippling debt load for the rest of her live so i am helping her to pay it back it seems to me that student loan debt is ripe for a kickstarter type funding mechanism where students should be able to setup an account on a website like yours that would allow them to provide links to friends and family so they can help repay part of the debt people could post this to facebook asking for help making payments when times are tough people could include the link with college graduation notices current students could setup an account asking for help repaying debt as it accrues bonus for current students allow family members to fund current students by pledging money for good grades which would be paid out at the end of the quartersemester based on electronic transcripts for instance they could pledge per a credit and per b credit this would give students more of a direct incentive to get good grades and focus on schoolwork rather than being forced to sacrifice study time to work some menial job for near minimum wage

IAmA,removed,hey gray not a question but if you do see this i love your name haha it has been the name ive used for every rpgame that allowed me to name my character i figure after all this somber conversation you might enjoy a much more light hearted comment its a name ive always felt to be full of courage and strength reading through your responses and story i can say you wield it worthy keep on fighting the good fight my friend
IAmA,removed,i absolutely love your energy enthusiasm and spirit you are such a positive person and i love that i think many people lack the zest for life and its saddening that it often takes one being faced with illness and knowing that their days are potentially numbered for them to live each day to the fullest i often fall into that trap myself and someone like yourself comes along and its so refreshing and inspiring to see you seize every moment while being so awesome i am personally so touched by your positive energy i havent felt that way in a few months but what already seems like a lifetime my dad passed away in sept this year from gbm he lived years from his initial diagnosis he went from never being sick to suddenly taking tons of pills undergoing a couple surgeries and several rounds of treatment despite that he never lost his optimism or humor even on days where he felt down he looked right back up and kept going his outlook on life was one that i will always admire and value i could never imagine what it must feel like to be in his shoes and that terrifies me i dont think i could ever be as brave or as strong as him i always looked up to my dad and now i look up at the sky up there there is no limit to his being he is free and in peace people such as you are often the light that people such as me need to help find our way you have such great purpose and i hope you continue to bring a lifetime more of dancing love and hope

IAmA,removed,steve its nash congrats on all your success brother glad everything is working out ps we need to do a podcast again soon
IAmA,removed,this is the second time hes posted this in the last few months
IAmA,removed,no i read it when i had access to my colleges library which included access to pretty much every national database for research but theres similar research i just googled something similar and this came up i used it for research and pretty much everyone else did too because it made it easier and gave you the information you needed to get started you wouldnt just use that just for scouting ideas how you do it is you do not quote wikipedia directly they cite their information too so you learn the basic idea get their citations go to the material they cited to make sure its accurate it usually is then you deduce pfffffft your conclusions from that academia is basically thinking of new ways to summarize other peoples research citing it too of course its wording the same shit differently but since it is differently and only you put it in that order with that research its original enough to not be considered plagiarism because you cite where you get the information and you directly quote and cite other peoples exact words if you use them like that basically its not stealing if you give people their credit so academia is basically you giving your own unique pffft opinion on other peoples researchusing your own research to back it up now keep this in mind those people you are quoting did the exact same fucking thing to someone else and they even cited where they got the information from at most the only truly original thing they do is come up with some contrived experiment or prove whether or not their idea pffft is accurate its the biggest fucking circle jerk in existence the only thing that compares in politics and the legal system which seems almost intentionally made to make no fucking sense that way you have to go to a lawyer or politician you may as well just call them bilingual in legal talk because thats really all it is another thing to keep in mind even if you wrote a page report on something they say there is so much information about every subject that youll not touch the surface of anything this basically means that it doesnt matter what you write youre just getting a small picture of it youre intentionally picking one niche within one field of study and nit picking the life out of that one thing thats what they say but youll notice that if you actually pick something out theres really not that much information about it because it doesnt need that much of an explanation youd be beating a dead horse so there are these what i like to call academic hot zones where teachers subtly steer students toward when they write they say things like i know theres not really that much research about that out there writing that paper will be near impossible and its true because most shit doesnt need that much information so they lead you were information is abundant which in another way to say every other person in your profession on the planet is studying this stuff which makes you pretty damn inconsequential in my opinion and all while doing thisthe vets arent learning what they actually want to do or how to do an actual job or apply the much better skills they learned in the military like why the hell arent all vets automatically entered into some kind of project management training that would apply to any job and they would see immediately how to use their training in a civilian setting because a lot of civilians are absolute crap in regard to leadership why not pick people who already have a firm grasp on it who would do well as a result of fine tuning their existing training and all of that is easy to implement common sense shit that colleges havent even tried to do not for any of their students but i dont feel sorry for the regular students they didnt do crap but i do have a soft spot for the vets theyve put in the work for society and are trying to do so for themselves so why the hell dont they get to see the results because some jackass is selling them snake oil is why and that jackass is academia
IAmA,removed,definitely agree many of the cases of civil forfeiture are abused by the government and police i had read the story previously and the whole concept law and execution of it seems total contrary to us laws and the constitution please continue your work in getting forfeiture changed if not eliminated and i expect you will be successful in your efforts

IAmA,removed,does no one want to mention this is a massive circle jerk
IAmA,removed,just shutup and fuck off you childish attentionseeking little cunt youre a fucking joke
IAmA,removed,are you also a narcissist seriously this is the stupidest thing ive ever read
IAmA,removed,ahahahah you just keep getting funnier ahaha didnt expect so much amusement from an attention seeking loser who started their own iama seriously thanks for the laughs my retarded little mate
IAmA,removed,i dont think trump is racist just a little rough around the edges obviously anything involving keeping illegal immigrants out of america is right down trumps alley do you really think its fair to call him racist by trying to keep illegal immigrants from allowing other illegal immigrants into the country absolutely not did your calculations in any way shape or form contribute to the publics perception of donald j trump absolutely not this is some truly cucklevel thinking right here and i hope in november you get your thinking caps on and vote for the one true protector of american ideals donald j trump thanks for reading urutledge this message is sponsored by rthedonald
IAmA,removed,people like bob rutledge have an element of cowardice in their bias to him lifting a few sentences in a fifth language is worse than bill using his power to serially sexually harass women and having surrogates call them trailer trash and whores when they spoke up
IAmA,removed,yeah sure heres my question do you genuinely believe that hillary fucking clinton is going to be a better president if so kill yourself
IAmA,removed,eh i doubt that calculation is even remotely correct
IAmA,removed,why wasnt this question answered it seems like a legitimate concern
IAmA,removed,how has the trump vs clinton tax plan weighed into your decision to vote in the general election
IAmA,removed,its because youre a cuck its okay
IAmA,removed,i do not agree with any of trumps positions then youre unfamiliar with all of them and a partisan hack
IAmA,removed,who gives a shit who gives a fuck
IAmA,removed,youre a cunt
IAmA,removed,illegal aliens arent american values islam isnt american values la raza isnt american values
IAmA,removed,nice to see the bullshit you spend your gift for science inprofessor disgusting to say the least an astrophysicist getting involved in bullshit politics what a waste of a fucking title you are
IAmA,removed,trump was the only one right httpimgurcomalglbl
IAmA,removed,waitwhy exactly does this warrant an ama
IAmA,removed,have seen snoopsnoo httpsnoopsnoocomurutledge
IAmA,removed,sounds like youre the pompous one in the group of your friends
IAmA,removed,how does it feel to a liberal shill willing the destruction of western civilization by importing lowiq brown people
IAmA,removed,seriously
IAmA,removed,i wonder what the statistical probability is that this entire ama is a paid hillary stunt in cooperation with reddit
IAmA,removed,women just have to excel at the highest level in all of stem like they do in biology and psychology and social sciences even when they have historically they have been erased this is part of what i was speaking to therere no barriers anymore thats becoming a tired excuse as tibertinus points out this claim is itself an example of one stereotype threat is one potential culprit even in early grades as is unconscious bias on the part of teachers in fact the very gender imbalance in question contributes to and later in their careers their instructors and prospective supervisors may perceive women to be less competent than men with the same credentials sexual harassment still in issue in many workplaces also occurs in academic science and and overt bias or mistreatment aside female researchers run into other challenges in economics and interesting new study looks at the differential impact of collaboration httpscholarharvardedusarsonspublicationsnotegenderdifferencesrecognitiongroupwork so women should forge ahead solo then well not so fast since who you know and collaborate with seems to have a big impact on career trajectory and the notorious twobody problem is only the start for researchers looking to have a life outside the labas others have noted about the muchanalyzed wage gap yes people do make different career choices they do not make them in a vacuum however ex this is not to say by the way that there are not differences in men and women but instead to draw out how difficult it still is to disentangle what is innate and what is not and wouldnt scienceand by extension the worldbenefit from maximizing productive contributions funny enough these issues are not only women scientist issues either academia and industry both could do a better job of supporting worklife balance of all researchers would we not be all the better for ensuring the women scientists of the world do feel safe taking a pondering walk in my experience the physicists are one of the most gentle group of people im glad for you that this has been your experience it hasnt been for everyone though anecdote is no sound basis for conclusions human experiences are compelling reading and so in conclusion i encourage you to peruse those that may have differed from yours say and httpstwittercomhashtagastrosh for starters extra note soviet russia tried to get girls to compete with boys at chess on average it was ok outcome but at the elite level the boys were far better its interesting you bring up chess as an example since im a big fan of the polgar sisters whose father specifically raised them with the intent of creating genius
IAmA,removed,casualama youre just a guy who wrote an article
IAmA,removed,is it because you have absolutely nothing to do with them apologizing and youre a just s lonely teacher

IAmA,removed,did any of you guys pull any pranks on set
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,the evidence youve provided doesnt prove that trump is a racist i see some articles that claim that he refused to rent homes to black people unfortunately they provide absolutely no evidence and trumps claim that he didnt want to rent to welfare recipients unless as qualified as any other candidate is perfectly reasonable furthermore it could easily be misconstrued as discriminatory against blacks when in actual fact its simply more likely that blacks are on welfare httpwwwstatisticbraincomwelfarestatistics trudeau has had numerous dealings and involvement with muslims who have ties to radical islamists does this mean trudeau is an islamist no
IAmA,removed,you are a master 😮
IAmA,removed,ahh you know what good on your for posting your facebook page i was about to make some kind of smartass illconceived comment of low ill repute and then i saw your face this chaotic entanglement of anonymous text we call the internet was for once humanised and given a face and as of today i call that face the face of robert rutledge i guess sometimes life is just too good that i try and manifest some kind of ghostly problem so that i can justify that burning hatred i feel for myself deep inside my question question hey bots look i wrote question with question marks you draconian bastards thats what were all here for right so what do you see when you close your eyes at night what haunts your dreams mr robert rutledge have you ever seen my face and will you ever see my face again

IAmA,removed,you should be locked up or gassed

IAmA,removed,i was sitting on my couch waiting for my sister and mother to get ready so i could go out and get new clothes and a hair cut at the exact moment you were shot no question i just thought it was interesting remembering such a mundane moment in time for me being such a tragic moment in anothers life at some other point on the planet its just a weird feeling
IAmA,removed,innocence lost what is it about losing your virginity good luck with it bud
IAmA,removed,after reading this ama i decided to look the incident up for sure this man had one if not several mental illnesses including npd the link it does go into detail about ops fathers history so many red flags to highlight monetary obsession controlling abusive theres one that really stood out though he was a hunter and would make his fiancée an animal lover skin the carcasses
IAmA,removed,she probably cheated on him

IAmA,removed,proof
IAmA,removed,i broke up with your mom shes a slut
IAmA,removed,what i would give to kidnap a famous midget and make his life a living hell i would force him to dress up in elf and leprechaun outfits and subject him to pure awfulness and humiliation just terrible degradation and shameful acts it would be so easy to break his spirit and drive him to suicide but i wouldnt let him do it if i could train a dog to rape on command then i would totally do that as well a really big dog like a mastiff he would be so completely and utterly powerless to stop it not to mention terrified a big ass dog is even scary and lifethreatening to a normal human but to a midget might as well be a dragon id keep him in a cell and whats more is that i would actually place to key inside with him but put it in a high place not extremely high but just ever so slightly out of reach it would drive him mad i would dress him like a baby and force feed him cent store baby food id also pick him up like a child and toss him from one corner to the next id grab him by one leg and swing him as hard and as fast as i could then hurl him to see how far he goes id rent one of those giant inflatable bounce houses and body slam him all day until my arms got tired id hold him down with hand and slowly stick things up his butt just to see him squirm i would stick him in dryers and turn them on and leave him in there for long periods of time id force him to fight other midgets to the death just so many things i would do
IAmA,removed,haha i would love to push dat bitch for the lols
IAmA,removed,were there two little peeps in that movie i wouldve sworn that was dinklage in bruge

IAmA,removed,congrats on your recovery i started reading this and then saw the link to your music and realized ive followed you on tumblr for years i remember you used to be obsessed with conner oberst and i was shocked to find out you were sick but we had never talked so i didnt feel right messaging you glad to hear all is well now
IAmA,removed,i dont have a question i just wanted to say good job
IAmA,removed,who cares
IAmA,removed,wow its nice you got this taken care of and you are cancer free now my mom passed away back in about months after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer it was in the very late stages and had spread she had breast cancer years before and when she was struck with ovarian i was mortified at how this could happen to her and how unlucky people can be she told me that one of her friends who had breast cancer actually got her ovaries removed and more i think since there was a chance the cancer could come back somewhere else i was mad at the world when i found out this could potentially have been avoided i would get full scans often to make sure everything is good
IAmA,removed,hope you stay well
IAmA,removed,can you guys buy me some pizza im starving and i dont get paid till friday
IAmA,removed,ive made the edit

IAmA,removed,fuck marry kill the rest of game attack im honestly disappointed no one seemed to ask this yet go
IAmA,removed,ok here seems to be more balanced link especially the discussions are worthwhile to read it seems that he has made an error when not stating that he himself wouldnt believe that such techniques can result in miracles but that is really scientists area to research one has to isolate himself from both the marketing hype individual beliefs of the practitioners and critique that is towards that concentrate in the things that are worth examining im not yet convinced that there wouldnt be something worthwhile examining more
IAmA,removed,hey tonight before i sleep im gonna pray as hard as i can that you get hit by a bus
IAmA,removed,why not distribute food on a way that doesnt get you arrested
IAmA,removed,here we have created a whole system so that we can have a substantial group of starving homeless people and then you go against the democratic vote and start to feed these people iww member aha you criminal anarchists you people are destroying america and turning it into a country without starving homeless people if it was up to you guys they would likely be housed and have a job as well wouldnt they absolutely disgusting display of human empathy that is why we have cops so that dont spread
IAmA,removed,totally unrelated to the story but that first pic the dude in th shorts has massive man boobs totally throwing me off
IAmA,removed,hi paisleyperson your post has been removed because your post has been removed because it lacks adequate proof unfortunately the links or photos youve posted could have been posted by anyone and they dont prove that you are the person doing the ama your proof needs to be something that connects the fact that youre doing an ama with your identity this could be something like a photo of you showing what youre doing the ama about with a sign that has your username and the date it could also be documents partially redacted if desired with a note that has the username and the date please let us know when the proof has been added by replying here and well put the post back up cheers please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,removed,i downvoted because his argument is hyperbolic and absurd the joe schmo rhetoric gets extremely tiring and the ricinlaced barbecue angle is ludicrous its not an honest attempt to provide criticism its a silly devilsadvocate straw man written for the sake of arguing
IAmA,removed,keep fighting the good fight bro
IAmA,removed,the inconvenience of witnessing homeless people eating near where you live is completely outweighed by the inconvenience of having nowhere to live and nothing to eat

IAmA,removed,given the minimal proof provided by the op we do not want to take the risk of having people mislead and have their money lost to a scam
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,blame the law makers and city council
IAmA,removed,hey mince hope you see this welcome to reddit see you soon hopefully ❤️
IAmA,removed,they have been feeding the homeless like this since the different groups change names a few times same outcome you did right morally speaking so my hats off to you tpd are morons and their press release women is a wacho to amny lawyers live in tampa thats the real reason there is a problem f them keep doing it but do it quick and fast move to new location they only have so many cops and think of the times you do it there are only cops on duty for all of hillsbough at midnight or do it between cops shift changes think like a criminal and you can do it without getting arrested and be gone before they show up f them
IAmA,removed,the democrats put that law in place
IAmA,removed,this is what i like to do with the homeless doubt the cops would care right when they ask you for money ask what the fuck is wrong with you when then stammer and or offer some lame excuse ask them where do you live this will get a non or nondirect answer ask do you live in america most homeless people are patriotic as are most people so they will straiten up a bit and say yes and for me i ask and you live in california again yes so what the fuck is wrong with you let me ask you another question if you wanted to could you have access to the internet i havent met one homeless person yet what doesnt have access to the internet if they wanted to ok i says so you live in the greatest country in the world at the best time in human history and in the best place and you have access to all the worlds information for the cost of nothing and if some how right now a timeportal was to open and your great great grandmother was to walk thru shed say whats wrong with you boy and before you get upset i want you to know that i listen to the words that leave my own mouth so while you are asking me for money because you think its going to solve your problems it wont and just so you know nobody in this world is helping me except for a few of my buddies who i am helping as much as i can because thats how the world works my idea is a simple one the only thing wrong with you is the story in your head telling you why you cant do or get what you want i dont believe it and neither should you that said because i listen to the words that leave my own mouth while youre out here demonstrating your highest value im working on larger things which is what my money is for whereby i left and went into the store imagine if homeless people got this speech times a day
IAmA,removed,good socialists belong in jail
IAmA,removed,people seem very keen to prevent a potential problem that is extraordinarily low risk im all for helping the homeless but that doesnt mean you should turn a blind eye to problems that have a very real possibility of happening just because we have never had a worldwide nuclear holocaust doesnt mean we should never worry about or regulatelimit who has access to nuclear weapons to label something a nonproblem simply because you dont understand the risk is ignorant in my area we have a number of organizations that help the homeless with food clothing hygiene and shelter they all follow local laws and statures and deal with the same issues that fnb does
IAmA,removed,why are you flight attendants suck fucking cunts
IAmA,removed,no offense but do you feel like a lazy piece of shit because you couldnt keep up with your job the only reason i ask this is because of your blatantly lazy edit to the sub seriously i wouldnt hire you after reading your edits to your ama introduction i would think you feel like a piece of shit
IAmA,removed,fuck off

IAmA,removed,well worth the read btw wright is an anglican aka not a scholar i would hope that op would not replace one fictitious belief with another there is no judeochristian afterlife just like there is no viking afterlife or no hindu afterlife not one religion or sect can be correct but all of them can certainly be wrong welcome to the real world embrace it
IAmA,removed,i was raised as jw as well left home and the faith when i was op is using all of the familiar lingo indicative of the culture and religion children in the religion are abused mentally psychologically i grew up as an outcast ridiculed sometimes beaten up and persecuted every day because my parents wanted to be witnesses i wasnt allowed to play sports befriend other children celebrate holidays or even dress like a normal child im not going to go to great length to describe the agony it caused me just imagine not being able to be normal in those ways imagine how brutal children can be and imagine teachers not caring in school because they themselves shun you as well none of it being my choice or my fault i feel for those poor children who arent even given a support system to be able to deal with that kind of anguish and depression the parents are oblivious in most cases like mine brainwashed and ignorant to the suffering of their children dont even get me started on the adult side of the religion which is every bit as bad as your worst workplace or clique driven social circle even if they are right and predict the end of the world tomorrow ill happily die at the hand of god knowing i didnt cause my children that kind of pain and suffering
IAmA,removed,i never knew any of this stuff about jehovahs witness before i thought they were just a bunch of really strict christians thank you so much for this the world needs more whistleblowers

IAmA,removed,yeah youre one of the people who will have deformed children too and youre probably going to grow up to be like the people in that sub who think that way because youre a simplistic piece of shit too simple to understand context or even respond as to why youre too stupid or lazy to treat someone you work with with respect or at least try to help her i hope you get aids and die
IAmA,removed,im just guessing this girl is meh looking works at some shitty night club and is no where near her ged much less a masters shes stripping for dirty animals rather than use her education in her field while working on her masters in an unstated field lol ok
IAmA,removed,what kind of upbringing deficits turned you into such a shallow promiscuous harlot
IAmA,removed,obesity is bmi you are guaranteed to have a bmi of its very easy to visually gauge it once a person reaches a certain point of fatness
IAmA,removed,dear op as someone who has worked in that industry i applaud you for doing this ama it takes courage to put yourself out there and show vulnerability unfortunately it looks like there are still some ridiculous beliefs about people who strip there seem to be men who think the only valuable thing about a woman is her sexual puritymileagewhatever naturally they will harp on about their opinions and even professing to speak for most men i swear i need to go on whatever mind reading course theyve been on oh and best tell my partner who ive been with for years he seems to have missed the strippers dont deserve respectlove memo in fact all of my long term relationship partners seemed to have missed that memo too what puzzles me is why they even want to be with a woman when all they care about and value are those things why not just use one of those lifelike dolls then they could do away with all those irritating things like free will personality and the ability to value ones self for more than her sexual mileagepurityrespect of men and those same men will profess to know whats in the minds of strippers themselves saying she doesnt respect herself again with the amazing mind reading there are plenty of strippers who respect themselves and with good reason i knew women who danced for fun one was happily married to her husband of decades others were just trying to support their families with the only means at their disposal and the only thing some mensociety valued from them at the time their sexuality and i knew women who were doing the same as you paying for studies thank you for doing this there are many people who respect you ignorance is unfortunately a hard thing to challenge and applaud you for doing so tldr gasp strippers can be intelligent strippers can respect themselves strippers can be respected by men strippers can have good relationships its almost as if they are just as varied as regular folks in this post im referring to female strippers as i havent known any male strippers personally
IAmA,removed,i completely agree i am a horrible person for thinking you are not fit to be a parent fuck me for not wanting a kid to grow up in a really bad situation right right and you would not be fit to be a parent ever even if you have a healthy child you are a cripple deal with it you will never be able to take care of a child and fulfill their needs properly stop deluding yourself you may adapt yes but the child will be neglected because of you are you fucking insane
IAmA,removed,im sorry i became so defensive i just wanted everyone to know that we would never be unintelligent about our decision he sent such horrible threatening comments on almost every question on this thread and seeing many people agree with that just threw me into a defensive state ever considered theres a fucking reason they agreed with me how deep are you in your delusions is there any chance of you taking your head out of your ass or is it so fat your head got stuck there permanently jesus christ adoption is definitely another option i also can live well into my if i stay healthy and if there was a chance i wasnt going to live i wouldnt do that to a child i thank you for your clarification and i hope i didnt come off too rudely well thank fuck youre not healthy at least you wont be here in ten years to torture some child
IAmA,removed,do you have a lack of braincells please stop spamming this thread you claim to have a much higher iq than everyone else but act like a fucking five year old and even if you have a child that is adopted you still wont care for it and have it be neglected and for reference i do think you shouldnt be alive you should have been aborted the world would be a better place without you at this point not only would we slowly eradicate sma but we wouldnt have cunts who guilt trip people
IAmA,removed,my problem with strippers is that youre not dancing on hot dudes but more likely someones greasy grandpa thats nasty and you should be ashamed of yourself
IAmA,removed,so why did you think any one would care
IAmA,removed,not the answer i was looking for are you even taking this ama seriously

IAmA,removed,i dare you to find one thing not true in this paragraph can you jews have been promoting degeneracy to keep the goyim occupied while they run the worlds financial system and they make sure everybody is chasing shiny coins for their whole life existence the internet and social media are creating a world of thoughtless selfabsorbed retards who cannot think for themselves although the internet is full of very useful information and a few great online communities the world would be better of without it the internet is mostly used as a tool to promote pornographic degeneracy and degenerate memes black lives matter negro culture sjws marxism drugs cuckolding feminism to keep the goyim occupied these memes are promoted to make them think a certain wrong way that will essentially brainwash them and keep them from thinking for themselves so therefore they will mindlessly serve their masters and destroy their own culture without even realizing it the movement of frankism seems to be when modern jews really started to promote degeneracy sabbatai zevi and jacob frank both promoted degenerate behavior and tried to normalize it jews are essentially promoting degenerate behavior so that their god will return and be fully restored they think if they get the goyim to do horrible and depraved things that their god will return so therefore they believe sins to be holy and will bring the restoration of god to the world sooner this is why jews are so heavily involved in hollywood pornography drugdistribution cultural marxism feminism music industry they use things such as movies music and pornography to encourage the goyim to do depraved and degenerate things you are being used as a tool to destroy your own race and culture open up your eyes and look around at the crumbling world infront of you open up your mind and finally learn to think for yourself never be afraid to go deeper down the rabbithole

IAmA,removed,the az law was a pile of shit new state department of marijuana with an enforcement agency that had peace officer status and could run covert ops laws outside of allowed limits were still extraordinarily heavy handed mostly felonies grow your own would immediately have been disallowed almost everywhere immediately it was a presented to help the law pass but would have been a total lie in practice new department of marijuana took over the medical system current licenses would stay valid but those things dont last very long the truth is the medical system would likely have been significantly changed after a year or so most of the medical dispensaries would have converted in the first year the law fucking reeked of good olboy crony capitalism only existing dispensaries could apply for licenses in the first year which would have used them all up the total number was rather small so they all get grandfathered in and no one else would be able to get in on the business no wonder the dispensaries all donated and lobbied for it lots of stupid campaigned against if for the wrong reasons with a proper law they wouldnt have had enough power to have stopped it im glad they stopped this one even if was for retarded reasons i read and researched the law there was misinformation but all the worst shit was real i support legalization but not if you set up a mafia at the same time
IAmA,removed,mr tervert just one question please i read your statement in a russian accent can you tell me why

IAmA,removed,i have about of student loans between loans i went to a trade school i couldnt afford to pay off my loans in years as they wanted around a month wtf i had to go with the income based repayment plan but now i will be paying for years my payments were dropped drastically at first but after about years i now pay about a month and its only increasing every year im tired of older people saying i should be living on my own by now but how the fuck am i suppose to afford even an apartment
IAmA,removed,looking at some of these loan amounts makes me feel a little better i owe and im losing my mind over it
IAmA,removed,everyday hero right here
IAmA,removed,hello i know this is pretty far down so it may not be seen but i wanted to ask anyway my husband has a parent plus loan out his father to the tune of about through navient the interest rates are which i feel is absolutely insane our goal is to get this debt out of his dads name asap right now my plan is to pull out his next round of unsub loans next school year and to take out a personal loan for to pay off the rest of the loan we both work in public education and file our taxes separately to maximize our ibr while we wait for pslf to kick in based on our situation does this route sound reasonable to take care of this debt is there something im missing regarding parent plus loans thank you ahead of time
IAmA,removed,upvote this to the top plz
IAmA,removed,my parents took on my debt with the plus loan unfortunately because they make but spend it as soon as they get it i dont qualify for anything other than a plus or a stafford after turning would it be advisable to not include my parents income on fafsa if im still in college then or is it better to remain a dependent
IAmA,removed,as long as you dont ask me as a tax payer to pay off your student loans that you signed off on im ok with any strategy you use
IAmA,removed,i dont personally have a student loan situation but my girlfriend does speaking from experience as it pertains to her and the stress and anxiety it can cause thank you for making this happen

IAmA,removed,but now that it fails they all say well that isnt true socialism parts of spain during the civil war the french commune the ukraine free territorys and today some parts of rojavakurds in syria are examples of socialism of course almost every attempt of socialism ended in tragedy one way or another the people in the french commune where butchered by versailles spain lost to fascism the ukrainians outlawed by the bolsheviks and the rojavians are currently fighting isis so who knows but any change that actually means something always either comes from or causes violence between the old forces and the new the point is that every attempt as socialism is bloody and awful this is basically your argument after the french revolution a emperor came to power who went to war against basically all of europe for many years as you can see any attempt at ending feudalism leads to war and the death of millions capitalismnotevenonce
IAmA,removed,is the original tweet that started it all it was later catapulted further by branden wardells vine but essentially dick is slang for gun

IAmA,removed,ellen is a shitburg of a person for sure but giving her a san francisco smile was out of line ellen was a failure on her own merits before alexis and steve decided to make her the patsy and from what ive heard theyve already started hiring remote employees again after that relocation bullshit they pulled with the relocation and firings they upturned peoples lives and negatively affected their livelihoods and for what to drop their metaphorical collective dicks on the table as a display of their passive aggressive dominance its bizarre honestly im not revealing sources so believe what you will though as bad as reddit appears to the general public its far far worse for those manning the ship san francisco smile smile to your face while stabbing you in the back all too common these days
IAmA,removed,this kinda has as bad of a ui as pied piper fix it why did you go for a green based color scheme
IAmA,removed,i like that you argue in vagaries about a specific implementation it speaks volumes to your fuckwittery
IAmA,removed,lmao its a disaster released in fucking dipshit holy hell this is a shitty scam

IAmA,removed,planning on shooting up your college
IAmA,removed,i read selective muslimism very confused for about seconds
IAmA,removed,what is the biology behind it to a lot of people it sounds like youre just being a coward everyone has to deal with difficult things in life stop selfvictimizing and get over it
IAmA,removed,im assuming your parents played a role in this there is no medical explanation for this except for shitty parents who dont raise their kid properly prove me wrong
IAmA,removed,well some photo proof i dont know how to explain how i got in other than i worked hard had good recommendations and wrote an essay that explained why i was ready for college this time around thats kind of an absurd question to ask someone having performed well in cc certainly helped plus columbia has a great program for admitting students with nontraditional backgrounds eg veterans returning studentstransfers from cc international students etc
IAmA,removed,im so sorry for being so late to this ama i hope you have a moment to answer one more when sarah silverman was fucking you was she wearing a condom
IAmA,removed,s

IAmA,removed,do you deny the holocaust if so how does it affect your work

IAmA,removed,they will explode much sooner than expected saw the russian leaks do you consider any precausions in the future its not the first time that some russians decide to screen something way too soon
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,why is it that it seems a bit confusing at times to understand whats going on during ceartain episodes
IAmA,removed,when ivar accuses lagertha of murder and asked for a duel i am surprised she was allowed to turn his challenge down it is my understanding that by viking law she would have to accept it and either fight a duel holmgang herself or choose a champion turning it down would a terrible mark on her character as she didnt respond to ivars dire insult accusing someone of murder was a grave insult in viking society
IAmA,removed,hi there i love vikings and just wanted to say that youre doing great job one of few tv shows that doesnt screw around and just gets to the point quickly instead of making everything dull the whole episode and at the end something interesting happens so you cant wait for another episode which is as dull as the previous one and again something exciting happens at the end and the cycle begins like in got
IAmA,removed,great job what is the craziest thing thats happened on the cruise thing about the job cruise staff pay like in general 🙂
IAmA,removed,have you considered a spinoff series following rollo and his descendants when vikings is over
IAmA,removed,was it hard to film lagathas scenes because you had an erection the whole time also could you tell her says hello
IAmA,removed,could you give tldrs for each season as a bit of fun
IAmA,removed,my brother is a huge fan of your show and so is his pregnant fiancé will you say hello kaylub so i can show him hes not a redditor so he will get a kick out of it keep up the good work man
IAmA,removed,just stepping in to say keep up the great work love the show and thanks
IAmA,removed,til vikings is back on tv and i missed the whole seaon and ragnar is dead fml i havent seen one commercial or ad saying it was back on
IAmA,removed,as someone who was not caught up a spoilers tag would have been great grrrrrrr
IAmA,removed,no questions just a huge thanks for my favourite series ever and a great job with the cast it is perfect ivar and floki are my favorite actors
IAmA,removed,first and foremost big fan of the show now for the actual question in the show several characters have what you could call religious experiences and these experiences generally correspond to the characters beliefs so my question is do you have any plans to go deeper into this topic either by causing characters to have religious experiences that do not correspond to their beliefs or maybe by explaining away some of these supernatural events as highly coincidental natural ones
IAmA,removed,damn you can follow me around any day gorgeous
IAmA,removed,do you like my music httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvmbjoxovmvw

IAmA,removed,thank you joel for your answer you did make the right assumptions i have not fullfilled my residence obligations i understand i do stand a chance to have my case reviewed i wonder wether it would be smarter to go to the canadian embassy and present it or if it would be more adequate to fly directly to canada and see what happens at the port of entry as an argentine citizen id normally need a visa to enter canada if i am deemed no longer a resident upon arriving to canada that would leave me on a tight spot i guess

IAmA,removed,after reading all these comments i just realized that not everyone can engage in their dreams whenever they want to i thought this was what everyone else did when dreaming
IAmA,removed,so i learned some of these steps a few years ago wrote down my dreams and then eventually my dreams did amazingly increase in vividness to the point i could even smell things ive never been fully lucid just much more aware and will remember the dreams better kind of like watching a virtual reality movie in my brain here is my problem and maybe you can help i usually only have these very vivid almost lucid dreams when i dont want them and they make me want to stay asleep during the night i have a normal sleepdream pattern then in the early morning hours when i get woken up by cars outside or my dogs moving around and fall back to sleep them bam ill dream intensely but then i need to wake up for workand i dont want to wake up i subconsciously know i have to get up but its like trying to wake up moving though thick fog eventually ill wake but ill be much more tired any help would be appreciated
IAmA,removed,i think me and everyone else here would use this ability for the same thing anyway i was wondering how you came across this concept of lucid dreaming and what inspired you to learnteach people about it
IAmA,removed,i frequently wake up throughout the night should i write down those dreams before going back to sleep or only the ones from when i finally wake up in the morning

IAmA,removed,i really would not worry until the elections are over and the first days have passed most politicians like to say things that they have absolutely no power over when president most of there rhetoric is to gain voters and not there real policy so wait just a few more months and see what happens this it the worst election that the country has had in many generations and is hopefully a sign that politics is going to change and become more about the citizens in the future unlike now where it has been all about greed and big business also stop listening or reading the msm news and opinion pieces they are biased and have spun simple comments into massive attacks on trump on behalf of clinton do not be taken in by the media and what they spew out whenever someone says something they can change into massive headlines just look at how the media attacked brexit saying the uk would collapsemeanwhile everything is looking better than ever before with many countries wanting to immediately start trade deals with the uk saying that i believe the media has done enough to prevent trump from ever wining the election

IAmA,removed,i read that entire novel someone linked so i feel i can pretty comfortably answer this what happened in your own words which led to the demise of lionhead a lack of cohesive direction and being bought out by microsoft essentially everyone was burning out on fable and instead of giving the studio a new ip to work on ms made the terrible decision of making fable a free to play multiplayer game because money it didnt work and ms sunk the loss to protect the ip which is still valuable fable it was also a time of massive cost restructuring at ms and xbox one was not working as predicted mainly due to an error in focusing on tv etc instead of games i mean what the fuck ms they literally gave sony the console wars trophy on a platter is there any hope of he fable franchise living on yes microsoft owns the franchise and member berries are incredibly valuable i would expect fable proper on the xbox one but obviously not made by lionshead how did the company change from fable one to the end grew enormously so much so they had to take on venture capital to stay afloat sounds like the studio kept its soul for the most part with ms in charge its just a bad set of circumstances really what was on the horizon before closure fable after fable legends allany of the inside details and secrets of the studio someone got in trouble for spelling out a homophobic slur on a fridge

IAmA,removed,im a writer and director only been at it a few yearscurrently working mostly on commercials but i really want to get more into writing my question is is there any chance of black mirror ever having a writing staff or do you want to write most of the episodes yourself the ideas i tend to gravitate towards are often scifitechnology based concepts exactly like those seen in black mirror and when i first saw the show i couldnt believe how perfectly it captured the style and themes that im usually interested in i literally had some of the same concepts for certain episodes written in my notes i keep a list of premises and concepts in my phone for when i think of something and i had one note that simply said a story where people rate each other and another was old people retire into a virtual world to live out the rest of their lives so you can imagine i flipped out when i saw san junipero i hadnt fleshed out the concept but i was blown away with what you did with it i have at least other concepts that would be perfect black mirror episodes writing for this show would be a dream any chance of you ever accepting outside scripts
IAmA,removed,what episode do you feel will most likely happen in real life first apart from the national anthem which has already kind of happened of course
IAmA,removed,hi everyone im an aspiring author ive got plenty of ideas in my mind that are very black mirrorish would you hired me as a writer for a bm episode i wish lol
IAmA,removed,no question from me love the show some of the best tv ever made when its at its peak however still doesnt top you screaming hooray for the nazis over and over again on national tv
IAmA,removed,im not the kind of person who gets effected deeply by media but i was working on a project that had me sitting down for about hours straight this past weekend so i ended up watching every episode of black mirror in a row i had just visited the bodies exhibit that morning and after viewing the entirety of your show in a row i ended up in a strange mindset of existential dread that was weighing me down i kinda lost my cool when i ended my marathon viewing with be right back i lost my mother at and i fear losing my wife or her losing me constantly especially after watching that episode i ended up having a severe anxiety attack later that night that landed me in the er because i couldnt function and thought i was having a heart attack i have no real question but i guess thank you for creating such a brilliant show and thanks for inadvertently allowing me to realize im not invincible and to seek help for my severe anxiety disorder
IAmA,removed,no love for a touch of cloth in this thread charlie you wont see this but thanks for the best comedy ive ever seen
IAmA,removed,when are newswipe and gameswipe coming back and whatever happened to chris morris

IAmA,removed,you sound like a pussy fight me irl
IAmA,removed,your the fucking cocksucker that decided to attack op based on his history instead of keeping it relevant to his ama what he dies outside of this ama is not something that needs to be discussed here maybe his account is used by many people who perhaps share the computer imnot saying op isnt a dick but whether he is or isnt isnt the topic of this ama
IAmA,removed,would you be interested in doing my podcast
IAmA,removed,who the hell is chloe from fairly odd parents

IAmA,removed,how does it feel like to be a piece of trash a figurative cumbucket for many horny men and that when you turn all your looks will be gone and youll wonder why you didnt do anything with your life
IAmA,removed,and publichealthwatch is like the boogeyman that all the junkies and sexual deviants of reddit blame for all the mean comments they get so kind of a big deal
IAmA,removed,that would imply he was a woman
IAmA,removed,the most vulnerable people in our society they wouldnt be so marginalized if they didnt act disgusting in the worst way possible they are failed men who mutilated their genitals into a disgusting knock off of a vagina and inject female hormones into their bodies as part of a horrifying attempt to portray the opposite sex transexuals are mentally disturbed sex perverts playing a onedimensional caricature of the opposite sex there are scarcely more disgusting behaviors than the psychotic roleplaying these freaks engage in
IAmA,removed,trust me when i say youre going to end up being a single mom and will probably kill yourself in the future just saying good for you making that money though prozzies make a lot of money too and theyre the happiness people on earth

IAmA,removed,damn nice job dude
IAmA,removed,this is an irrelevant statement this user didnt assert hell is in the bible he expressed an idea using the concept of hell whether or not that concept is in the bible has no relation to this conversation
IAmA,removed,
IAmA,removed,something doesnt have to exist to look realistic on television the dragons game of thrones look realistic but dragons dont exist also according to your logic if hell was written about in the bible it would exist and only then could somebody say this is a realistic portrayal of hell what use context the user obviously meant this is an accurate portrayal of the idea of hell youre just trying really hard to be pedantic

IAmA,removed,spot on is a misogynist who believes women should be forcibly raped to death
IAmA,removed,crack im told is pretty entertaining too answer the question its an ama after all do you honestly think you or a crack dealer are on the same level as a doctor or therapist or do you only answer questions which further your own delusions what percentage of your clients do you think have gaping psychological holes im just wondering so that we have a vague estimate of people youre enabling just so we can count how many people per night youre feeding off that way well know what percentage is you entertaining people and what percentage is you being a bloodsucking parasite i mean youve openly admitted that some of them come to strip clubs just to talk to someone or be held or treat you like a girlfriend do you think that enriches their life helps them grow as people what am saying of course you dont we both know its a salve that allows them to remain stagnant in whatever pit of misery theyre trapped in why confront your problem when you can watch ucollegestripper debase herself for money you just lie to yourself so that you can sleep at night christ you even admit that some people have addictions and act as if those things are fine if my friend came to me saying he had an addiction to strip clubs i wouldnt send him to another one id recommend he seek therapy because all hell find at a strip club is leeches like you if you bother to respond dont just parrot my words back at me devoid of the meaning they once had use your own fucking brain if youre so smart is a misogynist who believes women should be forcibly raped to death
IAmA,removed,so its not an ama its ask me anything which will allow me to further my own self image but seeing as you just wanted the last word and choose to continue deluding yourself i wont bother addressing what you said is a misogynist who believes women should be forcibly raped to death

IAmA,removed,ive seen many many people suggesting using a service such as onepassword but it doesnt make any sense to me in all reality wouldnt it it boil down to having just one password for every siteaccount again if they get into onepassword they have access to all of your login info including what site it actually belongs to i use httpwwwpasswordcardorgen website that generates a unique card that i keep on my person it has countless password possibilities and all i have to remember is green for emails start at g for gmail and type the next characters on the card i have the code that can recreate the card stored in a few secure locations seems like this would be the most secure way of doing things

IAmA,removed,just have to say you got it great with fallout nv because of the writing by chris avellone and i found myself enraveled in the story in they seemed to redo the people and events synths and abernathy i noticed in even though its set all the way across the country and broke the whole narrative so my point is what happened there and what made you leave the whole genre
IAmA,removed,heresy
IAmA,removed,how do you go about getting your data and fact checking it before getting it to the public obviously you cant go into full detail about sources or plans but if you could just give some insight to how you get such classified documents thank you for duty to the world
IAmA,removed,can you pass this along fuck you julian fuck you in your square grey head with a syphilitic hobo cock and fuck you for being his fucking mouthpiece i hope your whole operation goes down in flames
IAmA,removed,keep up the good work guys love you keep fighting for truth and freedom
IAmA,removed,why is julian assange still unwilling to face questioning over multiple rape allegations do you think this damages the good work that wikileaks does that youre willing to support a man accused by two women of sexual assault do you really think hilary clinton the wikileaks logo or was this meant to be a joke note whilst i support the ideals of wikileaks im increasingly uncomfortable with their methods and whilst they may deny it their tone and timing of their actions give the impression of partisanship
IAmA,removed,thank you for everything that wikileaks does everyone who contributes to wikileaks puts themselves at great risk for the benefit of the whole world
IAmA,removed,julian assange said trump would not be permitted to win i too always believed that hillary clinton was put in place and even chosen many years ago do you think the reason she backed down and trump wonis because of her possible connections to child trafficking and pedophilia and might they be afraid the next batch of emails could connect to it and put her under an investigation
IAmA,removed,question can you guys go fuck yourselves
IAmA,removed,die in jail
IAmA,removed,thanks for electing trump you partisan bastards
IAmA,removed,are you concerned about the way wikileaks was treated during the last few months of the election im talking of course about censorship and shadowbanning users who replied to your threads on rwikileaks
IAmA,removed,i sincerely hope you all rot in hell for your incessant need to interject into our political system balanced my ass

IAmA,removed,nate silver is a joke
IAmA,removed,wikileaks just want to point out not that its not obvious that you are receiving a lot of attention from upset hillary supporters these are the same people that gladly allowed trump supporters to be censored especially on this site with ctr i would not take them seriously they do not love free speech and have been brainwashed by mainstream media a lot of people myself included truly appreciate the work youre doing i dont have any questions ive been a huge fan since your bush leaks back in the day thank you for your hard work and i will continue donating to your cause

IAmA,removed,thats unexpected but i guess imgur is a technical miracle
IAmA,removed,i mean you can google it if you would like why else would they surround his name like that
IAmA,removed,do you expect us to believe that wikileaks cant figure out how to click upload and browse for a image and submit but they can figure out to to post a comment
IAmA,removed,i would like to know why there were no donald trump leaks
IAmA,removed,what are the chances that julian might die of natural causes soon i speak for a lot of people when i say we would like to plan a celebration

IAmA,removed,read the comments this is pretty messed up i dont want to sound like a crazy conspirist or anything but why does coporate always have to say theyre doing stuff for us but then they spout out some bullshit or have shady shit revealed basically what im trying to say is that maybe the people that can bring change and help the consumers the lower classes the normal everyday people should stop viewing them as resources
IAmA,removed,what the hell are you talking about wikileaks is the most technologically sophisticated publisher there is taking the most powerful government in a head to head cyber battle and you are claiming they are too stupid to upload to imgur

IAmA,removed,kill yourselves
IAmA,removed,as an american who pays taxes can you as a member of the jewish faith explain to me why my tax money should be used to fund the military forces of israel and specifically why should i be funding an apartheid style system that abuses palestinians blockades their port keeps them in poverty etc more to that point why should israel exist at all these days its not the fault of anyone alive today that israel was routinely conquered by the egyptians various persian powers the romans etc if the argument of well its the jewish homeland shouldnt the jewish people actually give it back to the cannanite tribe that they took it from in the place
IAmA,removed,it sounds like a lot of the inflammatory iranian rhetoric about the us and the uss about iran for that matter doesnt align with your experiences there in particular i read your response about your issues coming back into the us and the homeland security questions would you mind speaking a bit in whatever direction you feel moved about your impressions on the juxtaposition between politicians us iranian or both rhetoric and the effects you see in the respective populaces i know this is a bit open ended but my only insights into iran come courtesy of headlines and political conflicts im curious what it feels like on the ground

IAmA,removed,wanna get high and fuck
IAmA,removed,dr sack alcoholic here who just wants to help scare people away from drinking when i say scare i mean find a way to show people the possible outcomes of constant and heavy drinking on the pancreas three weeks ago i suffered from severe acute pancreatitis and have been in the hospital since the paim involved on this disease is like nothing else iv ever heard of hours of non stop level pain that not even morphine could numb my abdomen was swollen to the maximum and pancreatic fluids the fluids your body uses to break down fats during digestion were leaking everywhere so essentially my body was eating itself from the inside out now thats just the begining of the fun now my pancreas is operating at half power putting me at risk for diabetes iv also developed a large grapefruit sized cyst on the pancreas that will require draining via needle or surgery and carries the risk of rupturing and releasing more horrible fluids into my abdominal cavity causing even more risk of other organs failing if i drink just one more beer it will trigger an attack so powerful that it will kill me and not quickly slowly and painfully as my organs take turns shutting down just one sip of any alcoholic beverage could do this so iv vowed to never drink again i truly have no other option however i wish there was a way to show my fellow alcoholics what iv gone through as a year old bevause of alcoholic tendencies my life will never be the same again i cant eat the things i love to eat because high fat content can trigger an attack that will hospitalize me i may be in constant abdominal pain for the rest of my life i could end up relying om insulin for the rest of my life the list goes on and on so maybe next time someone is being stubborn about drinking heavily and often just let them know how easy it is to end up where i am in constant pain and living off a liquid diet in the hospital with a half dead pancreas relying on pain killers to function in any way near normal thank you for your time and i apologize for any typos or bad spelling im on my smartphone in my hospital bed filled with very powerful painkillers

IAmA,removed,stop cuntfusing the fact that this is an ask me anything
IAmA,removed,stop trying to cuntfuse people away from the facts about zoe quinn and her guys and fries
IAmA,removed,youre just cuntfusing the thread then
IAmA,removed,what is wrong with you we you raped as a child
IAmA,removed,did you just cuntfuse things
IAmA,removed,apparently i go to really boring parties
IAmA,removed,im sorry did you just assume your opinion has any value because as a woman you dont
IAmA,removed,speaking of garbage isnt it time you shut your mouth and take it out some women just dont know their place
IAmA,removed,i lost my mom from lung cancer last may my mom was the nicest and most positive person ive ever known and to all around her with no bs the best greek cook she loved to cook in order to satisfy her guests and family she found out she had lung cancer after major pain on her right leg which for weeks they were mistreating as sciatic nerve pain long story short cancer shattered her femur bone right and left ankle and spread to her whole body killing her within months she was very positive in the mornings and in major pain after pm will never forget the sounds she made in the hospital we never left her side someone was with her i really wonder what went through her mind we all pretended she would get better and didnt have the time to talk about things and possibly give closure or make her feel better i feel guilty a lot for not spending more time with her i dont wish what happened to her to anyone we miss her everyday
IAmA,removed,australians are cunts
IAmA,removed,i do the whole bodybuildingpowerlifting thing those are two completely different sports with completely different training methods that would be like saying you do the whole baseballgolf thing
IAmA,removed,whoa i felt a chill after reading this because i remembered how i tried surfing for the first time last year at venice beach at one point i was paddling towards the waves when a particularly strong one upended me and almost folded me in half backwards gave me a slight scare but i was ok kept surfing for an hour more im feeling like i might have dodged a major bullet sorry that happened to you hope you get better
IAmA,removed,today is the day
IAmA,removed,tldr for this ama thats been posted million times dudes are creepy and reddit posters confirm that there ive saved you at least mins of your life youre welcome
IAmA,removed,the training exercises last from weeks depending on the type so nothing really changes on the scale of things but if you want a small scenario that happened within that big picture i was put with being a fisherman i had a backstory that my cousin abdullah makan had been kidnapped by the enemy forces being accused of being a source for the us forces and so i wanted help to get him back but reluctant to get help in fear of being kidnapped myself this is all scripted mind you somewhere down the line driving to and from villages i got caught between a crossfire between the sapa forces and the us sapa was stationed in the town i had come from so the military thought i was a bomb truck headed for them and ended up opening fire i ducked down and somehow survived by parking and getting low the oct the administration in charge of training came to check to see whether i was dead or alive by checking the laser sensors that would alert if the vehicle had been penetrated or disabled and whether or not i was alive sure enough i had survived and when the oct okayed to continue the scenario the us forces came out from a sideline in the woods laying down cover fire still getting shot at from the town as they made their way to my vehicle opening my driver side door as a shield as pulling me out they can get rough it feels pretty real when everything goes down but i was eventually thrown into the woodland and soon detained and brought before their command as i then pleaded my case of being a fisherman leaving town tasking them to conclude their judgement on my innocence in that moment eventually it came down to me bargaining information i knew on sapa for my freedom and was recruited to give intel in exchange they help find my cousin getting caught in the crossfire was not a scripted event however i was given instructions for if i was captured questioned or otherwise anything else
IAmA,removed,i got involved by funny enough taking a visit to the unemployment office they were just hiring on post as for actual military expirience i have none though i tried to join but was disqualified due to health concerns
IAmA,removed,considered parttime on call we work week rotations we are the militarys drill training
IAmA,removed,actually speaking of the decon lines i had the military singing me the abcs because i was portraying a blind man who was in panic because of the blinding due to initial blast so i told them to keep talking they decided to sing
IAmA,removed,people actually treat it very realistically because its our us military getting this training mistakes made in scenarios arent permanent its training but overseas the mistake that was made could cost real lives so people are pretty serious
IAmA,removed,plus when stuff kicks off adrenaline takes over and the lines between scenario and real life are blurred
IAmA,removed,mostly its just being active in a village giving the towns life to make things look legitimate sometimes youll get pulled for special missions my days mostly consist of driving around to make the roads active ive been blown up a couple times though scares the crap out of you when you run over the random pressure plates
IAmA,removed,do you know what the word ghoul means if not perhaps you should look it up in case you are uncertain as to my point let me be a bit clearer what the fuck is wrong with you do you get a boner reading about this shit
IAmA,removed,how does it feel to be such an insufferable cunt
IAmA,removed,they use what they call simunation they have the explosion off to a safe distance away but they can replicate bombs so the fireworks are pretty spectacular if you are blown up you stay where you are until they bring an exploded junk car to take your vehicles place assign a new role vehicle and send you back out
IAmA,removed,everything i show is deemed unclassified i cant give detail of weapon vehicle types or names or ranks of any military personnel if that is what you are referring to
IAmA,removed,i cant give the pay grade due to confidential agreements but i can say that for a military age male i work a full weeks nonstop for hours each day
IAmA,removed,yes cubic inc if you want a link to their site i can provide it
IAmA,removed,sadly like previously stated i cant disclose that but know its pretty decent
IAmA,removed,also off rotation the box as we call it is still an wildlife reservation its open to the public when theres no training exercise so the map itself is public
IAmA,removed,yeah i got you xd i cant show pictures or videos of active training but can link unclassified and cleared photos and videos
IAmA,removed,unclassified mock news for training purposes the harnesses the civilians are wearing are pretty much laser tag sensors
IAmA,removed,lol nah ill link the jrtc page so you can look at government cleared stuff xd
IAmA,removed,httpswwwfacebookcomjrtcoperationsgroup
IAmA,removed,oh the scenarios last weeks but we as role players work in hour shifts we go home everyday but while out there we arent allowed phones besides the ones provided to us to contact the cage as we call it to update on situations that arise
IAmA,removed,thanks its really a cool job
IAmA,removed,that bitch can marvelous stuff with her tits
IAmA,removed,i personally havent witnessed any screw ups but ive heard of live rounds training gets shut down for hours to do inventory chutes not deploying during jumps and people not checking their backblast if you want to count it as a screw up us as role players if assigned certain role like embassy guards or police officer get issued guns too that are modified airsoft weapons that just make a sound and shoot the laser i one time got in a firefight and didnt turn my laser on low and behold i ended up dead lol or the military hugging a suicide bomber that was funny to watch
IAmA,removed,at what point did the idea of nazi pows will be a great kids book come to you and what if any intoxicants were involved
IAmA,removed,lol we are told not to screw with the wildlife and kfc belive it or not ive never eaten kfc we arent allowed to order food into the training area either
IAmA,removed,this girl about to give allow with every
IAmA,removed,alright lets tackle this one at a time yes they use red chem lights as a replacement for grenades theres no boom there unless a a firemarker is there explosive handler i cant discuss the actual weapons but what the soldier would use in reality is what they are actually given to use in the scenario as for artillery firemarker get the grid where it lands and plants the simunation that even does the whistlemissles its dummy rockets made of paper weapons are blank equipped with ir laser emitters like in laser tag they have octs that are the administration of the box so if youre being shot at by rockets but somehow dont die they are there to moderate and say that realistically you are dead but the lasers are fairly accurate exercises last for weeks at a time with shifts that run daynight for hour shifts we have shifts but the military sets up camp out there have pressure plates or trip wires on the road and the actual explosive is safely away off the road to detonate its mostly a loud boom with hollywood fireworks you hear and see the boom youre dead theres always danger in this stuff but there are alot of safety briefings and regulations we go through and as long as you use common sense everything works fine
IAmA,removed,happened in july actually
IAmA,removed,op for stands for opposing force or the enemy i know people have been sent out of state to different training areas but i think the main jrtc is here in fort polk we get people all the way from cali to new york coming to louisiana for this so im not sure if there are opportunities like this nearby
IAmA,removed,they are issued weapons that shoot blanks if a role player is issued a weapon as a police officer ect they are given modified airsoft weapons
IAmA,removed,i usually say oh its nothing special just saving the lives of countless soldiers through role play training its pretty cool to see peoples faces of disbelief when you sit and describe what you do and see and expitience out there
IAmA,removed,ha im that year old looking guy usually driving a big red truck or a white maintenence vehicle
IAmA,removed,i mean some come in guns a blazing but then some come in doing things by the book to the letter its really diverse and never really get the same expirience twice or see the same things happen twice
IAmA,removed,yes i work two weeks on two weeks off and all my bills are paid with some play money and savings
IAmA,removed,i personally and many others take things very serious because we know what we are training you guys for and know the jeopardy we put soldiers in when we give them mediocre expiriences ive reported several violations myself and am glad to be able to speak with you and give you inside information we have role players in play that speak foreign language and if we dont know the language we will mostly act confused or unresponsive to americans trying to talk to us in english until a translator is brought out there are some though that are just there for the paycheck but most of us are there to aid in the training to the best of out ability
IAmA,removed,the most badass i mean im always the goodbye but i dress in similar clothing to the bad guys so it always get me detained and such but i still think the look on their faces when they learn im a good guy ready to spill information is damn near priceless
IAmA,removed,httpswwwcubiccom
IAmA,removed,thank you for providing information on this i dont know much outside of fort polk
IAmA,removed,its an honor sir truly im proud to say that i treat the training very seriously and that the octs and ops are for the most part very watchful when it comes to these things especially since my role in the game is a nonrecruited source or a humint item as they call it ive broken down crying and even screamed in soldiers faces to deliver real life impact to the best of my knowledge i hope the training given is worthwhile to you and those under you sir as always i thank you for your service
IAmA,removed,no the expirience isnt something i personally get used to when stuff goes down i really do fear for my life and self preservation instincts kick in the first day was exciting until i realised they used actual fireworks for the booms scared the hell out of me
IAmA,removed,as in what expand on this a bit
IAmA,removed,guess its bust look up jrtc on youtube there are some videos
IAmA,removed,ops we have monthly meetings everything is common knowledge that can be watched on the jrtc site or their facebook
IAmA,removed,i meant from a different perspective im not giving detailed specifics of anything
IAmA,removed,sure as hell am ill have my training on the though
IAmA,removed,there are always dangers but safety is what we take the most serious out there its hard to explain the inner workings though
IAmA,removed,funny thing is that i barely play xd
IAmA,removed,do you suck dick
IAmA,removed,to be completely honest im not sure how to answer this there are reviews of scenarios that take place to assess and correct issues if thats what you are asking
IAmA,removed,im sure its to do with safety xd im just a roleplayer thats a question for the higher ups
IAmA,removed,ive been wanted to get into it but i mostly stick to online text based when i have time
IAmA,removed,its ever changing besides some downtime of normal village stuff like gardening and such theres always something going on so no i dont see myself getting bored
IAmA,removed,they fill in where needed but mostly play as the opposing force or the national security forces of the country that isnt the us
IAmA,removed,im not sure they have a career opportunities listing on the main site though but you can look around on linkedin and indeed ive seen postings
IAmA,removed,youd get exroed for sure these days the octs are stricter these days i dont get up and personal to those situations but ive seen people get taken out of play completely for this stuff
IAmA,removed,ha i dress like the bad guys a lot and sorta integrated myself into conversations and listen as they get comfortable telling me stuff casually but me being a source gives the info to the us which ive seen been used to take action
IAmA,removed,look up and see if where you live has need for military role play jobs
IAmA,removed,exactly xd
IAmA,removed,um over prefer military expirience i have none at least a ged and a valid drivers license have knowledge of radio ediquette and actively able to portray a role under a stressful environment
IAmA,removed,every time i see the unit again it seems they have improved and learned from some of their past mistakes but most do things pretty well besides some that are justidiots
IAmA,removed,usually its up to the work group leader to give you a crash course on it teaching you as you go
IAmA,removed,if a civilian is shot and was innocent how would the public react what the military does reflects how we as role players treat them the roles are for realism
IAmA,removed,i found it in the unemployment office search around online for military installations near you to see if they actively do training with civilians
IAmA,removed,pffft maybe a will see it lol
IAmA,removed,hi i just deleted everything else it would be great if you can approve it
IAmA,removed,fisherman village was turani blue chevy with cane poles and an ice chest you threatened to shoot my foot
IAmA,removed,its to test the most extreme and stress you guys to the max xd

IAmA,removed,savage
IAmA,removed,hes certainly no looker but how did you manage to bring in another caregiver you dont even have that shed be hot if she wasnt crippled look im impressed
IAmA,removed,why dont you just end it all
IAmA,removed,you are delusional you live on a world big rock in space with lots of people like yourself the fact you exist as a culture is luck extreme luck you are weak and your culture is invalid thankfully white people have a tendency to treat the lesser evolved species of man as pets you are welcome
IAmA,removed,reality was shoved up my ass due to me being born in a genetically superior culturally superior and social superior environment im sorry but if we just smile and let some bushman think they are strong because they chuck spears exactly how their forefathers did we are not doing them any favors hard truths are needed in this fucked up world sucks sjws like yourself deny them when the fuck did you abandon and become hostile to reality it is you idiots who will ensure that donald ends civilization

IAmA,removed,no questions but just a thank you to people like you and all the emergency services people out there i have a couple of stories id like to share where dispatchers got things right and made major differences in my life and in those close to me back when i was in or grade i was at my grandparents house for years my grandmother has had heart problems after what i understand was a botched sedativeanesthetic for a surgery one of the nights i was there she began having chest pain which wasnt totally abnormal for her she was confident that it wasnt a big issue but eventually my grandfather and i decided to call just in case within just a couple of minutes emts were there to immediately start getting valuable information and treating her while we made hospital arrangements turns out she was slowly entering into cardiac arrest iirc her heart rate dropped down to as low as at the hospital people like you saved my grandmothers life she might not be here today if not for the skilled operators like you who can address situations and dispatch those services so efficiently and now the second story a few years back a friend of mine who i knew was struggling with a variety of mentalemotional problems and had previously planned to take his life made a suicide threat his skype status late one night and told me to not worry about it find something to keep my mind off it and just wait til the next day to see if anything happened he then either started ignoring me or went offline i tried texting a mutual friend who i knew lived near him and could make sure things were okay but unfortunately that friend was already asleep i made the decision to call at the risk of seriously harming our friendship in the short term and also at the risk of calling over a potentially false threat that i was making worse with my anxious mind i was also considering in my head what if this causes him to not trust me next time and i as one of few people paying attention to his threats and acting dont have the ability to intervene what if he doesnt make the threat public next time it became a matter of whether i wanted to have a betrayed friend whos pissed at me but alive versus having a trusting friend who was dead and therefore hardly a friend in the practical sense back then i didnt know his address or any valuable location info so the operator had to look that up somehow id imagine by looking at property records or something based on last name i dont know what i would have done if they didnt figure out how to find that info because there was no one left i could call to make sure my friend was safe they were incredibly resourceful calm and collected even when clearly confused by the language used in the threat eg kms killing myself and the emoticons he added after to try and get people to worry less after they dispatched the welfare check they insisted despite my initial reservation that i talk to someone on the crisis line to calm down a bit at the time i was pretty sure i didnt need any help in hindsight im sure something in my voice carried across that i was actually in a terrified anxious state that conversation made it a lot easier for me to wind down and sleep that night it was about midnight by this point seriously thank you so much for what you do now that i think about it dispatchers have already helped save two people that are important to me and im only
IAmA,removed,words per minute my score is can i be your boss then
IAmA,removed,if i butt dial and realize later should i call back to tell them that im fine

IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,in the text of the post please include or more specific questions for the person you would like to have an ama from requests without the questions will be removed this is to ensure that there really is enough interest in the person that there would be something to talk about its in the subreddit rules for making a request
IAmA,not_removed,i stand corrected carry on
IAmA,not_removed,do you pay your cocoa bean farmersharvesters a livable wage do you provide any additional benefits such as education classes and or medical
IAmA,not_removed,my dad and sister always order cadburry specifically from england does it really matter where the chocolate is manufactured
IAmA,not_removed,do you know about how north americas chocolate making processes differ from other parts of the world context im from new zealand when i have visited north america usa and canada i was disappointed to find that a lot of the chocolate i had whether a block or in a candy bar form seemed quite low quality some even seemed oily when looking up one chocolate bars name to find out what it was i found out that the version in canada wasnt milk chocolate all but a chocolate compound did i just pick a poor sample of chocolate all seemed like common brands some have told me its probably corn syrup palm oil not using enough cocoa mass or something to that effect but i figure you would know more about might be going on here the only thing that was like the chocolate back home was san franciscos superb ghirardelli chocolate which reminded me of the wonderful whittakers brand we have back home both of which are a sort of similar quality to lindt for those that might be able to use that as a reference
IAmA,not_removed,what is a typical work day like for you
IAmA,not_removed,where is your cacao harvested
IAmA,not_removed,does working and being around cocoa and chocolate all day have an effect on your appetite or fondness for chocolate ive heard that some people that work around the same food products all day eventually loath the food even though they used to like it
IAmA,not_removed,are you coo coo for cocoa puffs
IAmA,not_removed,is it true that cocoa is going extinct
IAmA,not_removed,im assuming that the cocoa fields will be massive does this by any means affect the soil in the region is it sustainable to have large scale farming focused in one region
IAmA,not_removed,do you guys liquid refine your chocolate after conching how big are you conches what brand are your conches and refiners from bean to bar how long would your process take do you use fresh milk or milk powder in your process how many people work in your factory
IAmA,not_removed,any specialty chocolate product or products you like out of the ordinary mine hot chocolate with just straight up spiceshow i drink my coffee toothe arabic way
IAmA,not_removed,will there be more milk chocolate made than dark chocolate if the price goes up due to poor crop yields
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a contract with the farmers or do they own the fields do you have non competes with your customers
IAmA,not_removed,how much chocolate does a popular chocolate bar nestle hersheys etc contain what about nutella
IAmA,not_removed,i heard certain bugs go into cocoa powder due to the cocoa beans left on the floor
IAmA,not_removed,hi there im a decent chocolate fan in the us what chocolate brand or product has the best value in terms of chocolate quality i ask because i heard a few years ago that us chocolate allowed less pure cocoa to be used to make chocolate pieces i may have confused some of the terms but anyways thanks
IAmA,not_removed,what does chocolate have in common with cocaine
IAmA,not_removed,ive heard that most american and canadian cocoa products are sourced from from southern north america and from south america while most european cocoa products are sourced from africa and southeast asia is that true
IAmA,not_removed,i like hot chocolate and chocolate milk do you
IAmA,not_removed,do you take the hershey highway
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever bathed in chocolate
IAmA,not_removed,hi how do you calculate the rough price of a cocoa bar from the cocoa beans is there some formula
IAmA,not_removed,does your company take the time to do the fermentation process do you know which companies do the fermentation process i have a cavity and cant have too much phytic acid in my diet anymore it hurts my tooth too much
IAmA,not_removed,thats what my above response mentioned while i cant say if they actually do it or it works sustainable programs pay for farmers education and higher bean costs
IAmA,not_removed,yes different countries have varying legal requirements for food products in the uk it must contain at least cocoa solids cocoa butter or liqour whilst in the us it only requires to be sold as chocolate that other between the same bars in other countries can often be made up with cheeper products to save money since chocolate is mostly sugar and fat with the global goal of trying to cut down both in our diets in the next years the flavour of chocolate will change alot it wont be a drastic change as no doubt they will remove a small percentage at a time over a long period likewise with ingredients where they come from may effect the taste cocoa beans from different places will have different tastes sugar cane beat sugar or corn syrup will all affect the taste where the milk is from and the fat content will affect the final flavour finally the process of making the chocolate will affect the flavour was it batch mixed or continuous mixing conche time and heat time of adding any additions to the conche i would even go as far to say that the machines it was produced on would make a change in taste depending on the products
IAmA,not_removed,the other answer explains this really accurately i cant really think of a different factor that would cause variation
IAmA,not_removed,this seems to explain it fairly well and from what i know about our process seems fairly accurate httpswwwquoracomwhydobritishandamericanchocolatetastedifferent as far as brands go it depends on what you eat ghirardelli and godiva are fairly well known high quality chocolates companies like mars nestlé and hershey tend to be mass producing cheaper chocolates and may skimp on quality a simple breakdown of the typical american process would be bean cleaning alkalize bean if going for dutchedalkalized cocoa roast bean grind bean into liquor ship raw liquor to customerpress itmake into chocolate press half the butter out mill the solid cakesship out finished chocolatecocoa powder either gets shipped used in chocolate or gets put into something called a black reactor for sometimes days this makes jet black cocoa edit just to make sure im explaining this entirely i cant verify european methods but from what ive heard we essentially use spoiled milk and our process is just different but bad chocolate is bad chocolate no matter where you are
IAmA,not_removed,it varies greatly depending on where you you work in everything but refining making chocolate as we know it molding this is one of the end processes and the chocolate drop lines are not climate controlled an average summer day is anywhere from fahrenheit that being said roasting deodorizing and dutching tends to sit and just stare at a computer screen all day cocoa pressing where the cocoa butter and powder come from tend to be on our feet all shift monitoring the processes and taking samples its really focused on quality because the equipment in this area is complex its a bunch of foot hydraulic presses that press liquid cocoa beans at bar or roughly psi its also really dangerous molding and the drop lines are at the end of the line so we just double check the metal detectors and stack product into boxes for shipment cocoa milling is terrible you throw pounds of cocoa onto a pallet doing maybe pounds or more in an hour shift
IAmA,not_removed,mostly along the equator but to name some countries madagascar usually organic beans mexico ivory coast is a huge one ghana
IAmA,not_removed,its funny actually i mainly work in the cocoa areas and in that state its mainly referred to as liquor its horribly bitter ever heard of cocoa nib in craft beer thats whats used but anyway they give us pound bars a year for free and free chocolate daily for me i just am not as fond of it as i once was ive had really high quality chocolate before and leaving work to buy typical counter chocolate isnt really as appealing although reeses has and will be always my guilty pleasure and oreos even though they are nasty lol
IAmA,not_removed,reeses puffs are more my thing
IAmA,not_removed,i highly doubt it we on average at my plant alone produce easily pounds of beans in an hour through various methods not just roasting but thats what these sustainability programs are made to address because the current issue is cocoa farmers are very uneducated the sustainable program produces higher quality beans at a higher rate and supposedly allows them to reuse the soil again
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwrainforestallianceorgworkagriculture sassandra program press release these are both dedicated to improving the beans and farmers income at the very least from what i heard but couldnt find any sources for outside of work which isnt rare tbh cocoa beans are hard to replant in the same area these projects are dedicated to fixing that as well whether thats through education on proper growing or different growing methodology im not really sure and the farms are everywhere lol its pretty much the whole equator is dedicated to growing beans but even mexico has some when we had it they allegedly grew the beans next to pepper farms so the beans had a very spicy flavor and smell to them
IAmA,not_removed,cant really speak too much for the refining process they hold i believe pounds most of our equipment is either barth dyvus or buhler depends on the recipes being done roasting can take up to hours for pounds of alkalized cocoa hours for grinding half hour to press it with presses maybe an hour to mill it refining is a big blank area for me at that point but they usually have a higher demand than what we produce milk powder i believe between all shifts around
IAmA,not_removed,i honestly like the sea salt and chocolate mixtures i unfortunately dont always see the end of the line so its hard to say what they actually go into haha but from what i know about and have tried beer with cocoa nib high nib content soft chocolate not really sure how this is accomplished but imagine brownie like texture and how it dissolves in your mouth oustanding id have to think of some more to be honest haha was more expecting the how its made questions i thought people would be asking about big brands and such p
IAmA,not_removed,dark chocolate actually typically uses more coca nib per bar
IAmA,not_removed,that end im not entirely sure about our name is on cocoa field signs so im not sure if they operate independently and we just own large shares
IAmA,not_removed,it depends on what you mean by chocolate however a lot of these companies keep their recipes really secret and tens to just buy liquor liquefied beans wholesale in large quantities when they get the shipments they batch mix it themselves
IAmA,not_removed,nope the fda and our customers audit us constantly brc is also a yearly audit and we have over bug and rat traps labeled around the plant with huge industrial bug zappers the closest thing to this is before the fields were really focused on quality and cost we used to get trucks filled with beans and exotic spidersrats someone was hired just to shoot these animals before they could escape
IAmA,not_removed,i cant really say for sure but through what ive heard and unrelated nonnda related experiences ghirardelli are very meticulous about following exact recipes and processing times to ensure consistent flavor profiles besides that larger customers tend to pay to have us import their specific ingredients into our manufacturing facility who this is i cant say
IAmA,not_removed,you got me there lol
IAmA,not_removed,nope ivory coast is the most common source for beans i imagine world wide
IAmA,not_removed,of course
IAmA,not_removed,not really sure what youre getting at lol
IAmA,not_removed,thats definitely not my area of expertise thats a process done across the world
IAmA,not_removed,ah i see sorry ive been up all night follow up question do you get to travel a lot between the countries your company operates in and how much do you love your job
IAmA,not_removed,pretty good answer
IAmA,not_removed,wow thanks for the informative answer
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the comprehensive reply ill give that link a good read a lot of the chocolate i had with the exception of ghirardelli who i believe are now lindt owned was likely from one of those giants yes i understand that theres probably a flavour preference between markets which might also explain some the difference too have you tried a lot of chocolate from around the world yourself do you have any favourites or comments on them if so if shipping wasnt so expensive from nz id offer to send you some kiwi made whittakers chocolate to sample
IAmA,not_removed,ive seen a lot of talk about how countries on the west coast of africa use child labor and slave labor to produce cocoa
IAmA,not_removed,yeah ive had sea salt and chocolate before beer chocolatethats a new one to meive seen chocolate soda didnt know about the beer id imagine it tastes like a toosie popmaybe not too big on sugar tbh bc i dont want diabetes which is why i drink my coffee with nutmegcayennepaprikawhatever spices i have but anything totally different i want to try off topic but like as a kid the science center gift shop was amazing to me compared to say a regular toy store regular stuff is just no good i want the new gizmos and gadgets you cant find anywhere else and its why im always going to the japanese supermarketsthey just have so much weird stufffruits youve never heard ofweird drinksaquariums with live fish you can fry on the spot
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the reply
IAmA,not_removed,huh good to know ive been a consistent sucker for lindt for european chocolatebut ill look out for this other brand
IAmA,not_removed,but its a serious question i really want to just casually say to my friend while eating chocolate you know chocolate and cocaine both have one thing in common you would never guess that
IAmA,not_removed,you fucking suck
IAmA,not_removed,its alright no not really the best we can do is transfer to a new plant or if youre going to be bringing equipment into a new facility you get to look it over at a different one i honestly dont like it its nothing really to do with the job itself more or less the company we hire too much management and slack on hiring floor personnel the pay isnt that great and they like to work you as hard as possible especially if youre a good employee too many people have left because they dont really care about you as a person anymore perfect example is they used to pay us more to work weekends you worked two twelves on the weekend one day during the week and you got an extra hours for free well they switched to an exclusive hour shift for a year of our work force left and they decided going back to the hour shifts on the weekends would be good now you work two twelves and two hour shifts where they can fit you so i now work over night on the weekends and prior to that i work two shift days so i effectively have to be back into work on a new schedule not even hours later
IAmA,not_removed,the link explains too that it also had to do with agriculture as for my preference ive never actually had chocolate from outside of the united states but i want to spend time traveling and i always sample new foods my favorite chocolate would have to be our own bars which are only available to employees its probably the best chocolate ive ever had and ive had other people tell me the same its really high quality and the favorite make is the seasalt and almond milk chocolate bar or the almond dark chocolate it usually has a cocoa nib mass i believe the bars are retail though lol
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldnt doubt it theyre very poor countries and a lot dont earn a livable wage off of one crop many will grow several types of crops directly next to each other ive found marbles rings coconut and other types of plants mixed in with beans on magnets on arrival from africa
IAmA,not_removed,to be honest the nib of the cocoa bean is really bitter if the product itself it bitter or may go good with a bitter flavor it probably has been combined with cocoa nib
IAmA,not_removed,no problem its also important to mention that when you said cocoa beans and cocoa powder they are two separate products prior to becoming powder or anything else for that matter the beans are roasted for at least minutes at degrees fahrenheit or for hours at degrees celsius any bugs and bacteria are dead
IAmA,not_removed,theyre pretty big kohls near me actually sells them
IAmA,not_removed,quick google search shows cocaine comes from coca not cocoa sorry to burst your bubble p
IAmA,not_removed,only on tuesdays
IAmA,not_removed,its really high quality and the favorite make is the seasalt and almond milk chocolate bar or the almond dark chocolate it usually has a cocoa nib mass as someone who is eating right now this sounds amazing and right up my alley
IAmA,not_removed,ha theres a place in town here that makes their own chocolate from cacao beans their bars cost each the one is actually quite amazing
IAmA,not_removed,good to knowill look out for cocoa nib products anything wo sugar or very little sugar even if its bitterthats for me
IAmA,not_removed,i seethanks for the informations might start eating chocolate again
IAmA,not_removed,yes i imagine there are as famous as the other international brands
IAmA,not_removed,aaaahhh i have always been believing that chocolate does really have something in common with cocaine my bubble has been burst but thanks anyway for the info
IAmA,not_removed,no seriously how the fuck do you not know you work for the biggest supplier in north america and dont know about the process
IAmA,not_removed,this is all i can really share p but this is my favorite
IAmA,not_removed,jesus i dont think i would pay that much lol
IAmA,not_removed,i would definitely look for a little sugar haha sugar free is actually considered a laxative for most people how that works im not really sure
IAmA,not_removed,oh man i wouldnt let any rumors stop you dark chocolate is healthier for you because it has more of the bean and less additives besides that anything thats actual chocolate isnt that bad things like chocolate wafers and fillings may be a bit more odd with the ingredients but its all in legal dosages that really dont harm you
IAmA,not_removed,well actually looking online shows theyre owned by lindt so you may like them after all
IAmA,not_removed,sorry man p if anything you can say that they both come from a plant
IAmA,not_removed,because if you had a fucking brain you would have read through the context of my prior posts detailing that these are grown mostly in africa my company processes beans into cocoa they dont ferment it googling cocoa fermentation leads you to this do your own fucking research you obviously dont know a single thing about the process and i nicely stated originally that i dont know anything about the process because its done across the world
IAmA,not_removed,yeahno delicous poison for me ill stick to my bland laxative gruel but coffee arabica is delicous you should try it the way the arabs do it with spices hot chocolate is different i drink that the mayan way with chili
IAmA,not_removed,what huh i underestimated lindt ha ha ha
IAmA,not_removed,im gunna call bullshit on this whole iama you dont know if your company has fermented cocoa or not
IAmA,not_removed,you fucking moron it clearly says ama on your post so i did
IAmA,not_removed,i definitely should thanks
IAmA,not_removed,i really dont care if you call this bullshit you asked if we fermented our own beans and how that process works i said i have no idea because its done across the world how fucking dull are you
IAmA,not_removed,and how fucking ignorant are you you dont even know what your company brings in so it could be horse manure for all you know right
IAmA,not_removed,how fucking ignorant are you i can know what the bean type the flavor profile and pretty much everything else i need without knowing the fermentation process i swear some people are just fucking retarded
IAmA,not_removed,im the only employee in my company that has effectively learned most of the process from bean to product and as such thought it would be fun to do d i have a feeling you press buttons on an assembly line that put wrappers on candy bars or something i thought you were like a supplier or contractor
IAmA,not_removed,if you bother to do any research on cocoa processors you would see youre a fucking moron the basic reason why is we dont send out chocolate bars or wrap anything it all gets sent to manufacturers
IAmA,not_removed,ok
IAmA,not_removed,educator here and i was just curious as to what kind of data youve been able to collect about how successful this approach has been for those students using your system have you seen a large jump in their lexile scores using this system vs the traditional method as someone in the classroom i can tell you the gamification of course work makes learning a lot more fun for our students so id like to say thanks for spicing up the classroom
IAmA,not_removed,the human brain can only retain about symbols really i have memorised many more chinese characters than that how can chinese people memorise so many thousands of symbols in multiple languages if the human brain can only retain symbols however as an english teacher i am interested in your work
IAmA,not_removed,hi i am the father of and a prolific reader are you seriously telling me that people are teaching kids using the sight method not a single educational cartoon i have seen and i seem them all does this not a single preschool nor any of the kg teachers in my daughters school none in grade either sure there are sight word lists but thats not the basis of reading sounding out the words is do you have direct evidence of school curriculum espousing this
IAmA,not_removed,can you elaborate on the whole world concept and the symbols limit many people have vocabularies well beyond words and use nonword symbols like a thumbs up is there like transient forgetfulness and we only use the symbols most recently encountered and factoring in commonness to them or does it take on a different solution of these people simply understanding that words are comprised of symbols or the sounds you mentioned but if thats true how does a language like chinese function where there are many different symbols used for just one purpose
IAmA,not_removed,why are you buttressing your argument for phonemic awareness instruction with data from naeps reading assessments phonemic awareness is taught in early elementary by grade the first year in which naep administers their reading instrument almost every student has had several years of phonics instruction beginning with kindergarten and moving through grade in fact its not even a skill that naep measures because its assumed that students already have a grasp of it so even if a students phonics skills are lacking its not something you can detect in naep data furthermore i feel like its important to note that naep reading assessment data includes ell students and students with disabilities once you control for those two populations the number of students at proficient or above hover somewhere around the lowtomid mark if youre going to set the baseline at basic rather than proficient you find that around of students nondisability and nonell perform at that basic watermark which is really not terrible all things considered also these percentages for subpopulations and the population across all baselines have been trending steadily upward since naep began administering their new assessments back in
IAmA,not_removed,good morning have you read the research behind httpthirtymillionwordsorg how coulddid this impact your game and do you see yourself folding this extremely important research into your methods edit honestly it seems to me that we have an epidemic of parents not interacting and communicating enough with their children starting at birth which is driving your statistics here about childhood reading levels
IAmA,not_removed,besides la what other school districts are you claiming use whole word instruction ive taught first grade for years though im currently on maternity leave i have my masters in elementary ed and my national board certification in early childhood ed this is the first im hearing of any sight program i disagree wholeheartedly that whole word instruction is the most common method in fact ive never heard of a school or program doing anything other than teaching all essential components of reading as outlined by the national reading panels report heres a brief explanation of the report for those that are curious also what standards are you using for grade level are you using fountas and pinnell for assessments dra these assessments and grade level requirements can vary wildly by district and state and are often pushing kids to move too fast kids need more time to learn to read before being expected to read to learn i have found this transition to most readily occur during the first and second grade year edit please forgive my blunt questioning i feel youre putting down my profession and colleagues and taking advantage of the frustrations of concerned parents just to promote your app it may be a wonderful program but your approach is rather disrespectful
IAmA,not_removed,reading lpt turn the sound off and turn on close captioning when your kids watch a movietv show ive had so many whats this word mean conversations because of this
IAmA,not_removed,are you aware you accidentally a word in the post title how does that reflect on literacy in general
IAmA,not_removed,did anyone else notice the typo in the title was this all one big conspiracy
IAmA,not_removed,off topic but is there anything that can be done to help adults who can read at a middle school level but need better reading skills ive seen plenty of work on teaching illiterate adults up to elementary school level but nothing on teaching adults who already have insufficient reading skills how to read better
IAmA,not_removed,serious question even though it sounds silly if nearly of kids read below grade level then wouldnt that suggest that grade level is incorrectly assessed there is no objective level at which a fourth grader should be able to read is there surely what defines a fourth grade level is simply a measure of relative ability against ones peers to me this sounds a bit like saying of people are above the median height
IAmA,not_removed,so essentially youre pushing a digital version of hooked on phonics
IAmA,not_removed,did you do any research into the reading recovery program when building the game my mothers a reading teacher and its apparently a pretty effective way to get first graders back on track although it requires special teacher training and oneonone attention
IAmA,not_removed,have you thought about opening up a center for children who cant read good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too
IAmA,not_removed,how common is whole word teaching ive never heard of it and i learned to read with the phoneme method from a public school a good years ago im shocked to read that whole word teaching is common are there people who actually think whole word is better or is it simply lazy uninformed teaching also is there any research on the limitations of sight reading compared to symbolbased writing systems like chinese ive never heard of chinesejapanese students hitting a wall around characters note for pedants i speak japanese and i am aware that kanji are not arbitrary symbols but are made of up elements that help convey phonetics and meaning
IAmA,not_removed,hi thanks for doing the ama two questions in your introduction you said that teaching methods are antiquated but do you mean that the methods used to teach kids to read in earlier times were also wrong or that language has evolved and the methods were currently using today arent adequate to keep up with those changes how do reading techniques currently used to teach kids in the us measure up against those used in other advanced countries sorry im being cheeky a bit of a side question what are your thoughts on common core thank you
IAmA,not_removed,is the title of this post a subtle test of our reading skills nearly of americas kids read below grade level i am dr michael colvard and i teamed up with a producer from the simpsons to build a game to help ama
IAmA,not_removed,i call bullshit as a parent and having raised two nephews with my dad in a shitty schools in philly when i was young it has much more to do with parents not reading to the kids than whole word reading none of their friends parents read to them and guess what they didnt want to read and couldnt read my nephews read and thats most likely because we read to them every night same shitty schools my sister went to the same schools and shes now a physician as well its the culture in the home more than the schools and yes my kids went to la schools they will never care as much as an involved parentguardian oh right we cant touch parenting in america have to blame the schools and teachers
IAmA,not_removed,why did you post this it looks like its just an advertisement for your app
IAmA,not_removed,i was taught phonics in elementary school in the is phonics not taught now days
IAmA,not_removed,i know im late for the ama but i am posting in hopes that i may get a reply mr colvard my mother is a public elementary school teacher who teaches grade in the state of wisconsin she has been teaching for over a decade she has taught all grades and is extremely dedicated to her profession she is one of the hardest working teachers i have ever met however she is constantly under immense amounts of stress year after year in attempt to raise the reading levels of the children to to get them to a grade reading level by the end of the year she must report on these and they will directly affect her performance reviews one issue that she always sees at the beginning of the year is that most children that come into her grade are at a grade level or below this greatly impedes her work and adds extra steps in order to bring these kids back to a standard reading level she has seen this happen not only on a grade level but at all grades it seems like there is not a large focus on students reading levels it feels like the states standardized tests and requirements focus more on mathematics and scienceat least in her school district miraculously she is able to bring kids reading levels up to fifth grade and beyond a large portion of her success comes from table time where she groups all the low level readers and helps them with their struggles she then teaches them to help one another and cooperate together in most cases all the students in the group are able to recover and can read at grade level so this is my question for you how do you propose to implement this phoneme farm into a elementary school platform it seems like a large issue is that there is a trend where these children are starting at below reading level at the beginning of the year and barely pass by at the end of the years would you implement this as early as a kindergarten or pre school level i know you say you arent an educator however i am curious to see you professional standpoint on this because this seems like it could greatly help the reading level of any student across all ages thank you for taking the time to read this
IAmA,not_removed,ummm your title has a grade level grammatical error in it does it not
IAmA,not_removed,if our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong then why did they work so much better and years ago than they do now and why do they continue to work great in other countries if they worked before isnt it some sort of societal or social change thats at least equally to blame its seems ridiculous to me that giving children even more screen time is the solution when screen time has been directly linked to all sorts of learning and attention span problems in kids
IAmA,not_removed,what would be your recommendation to best help my future child to succeed at reading using the phoneme farm method seems like an improvement over the whole word method but should i force them to read more when they are younger also does it matter the type of book they read or just make sure it is at an appropriate level for their current reading ability
IAmA,not_removed,i grew up with this httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvghypqzztlc but sadly they dont even do this on sesame street anymore
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think of working memory and brain training games are they helpful is there a downside to screen time that is outweighed by the good of educational apps
IAmA,not_removed,im sure its too late for me to chime in here but theres no way this is accurate character limit what to read a newspaper in japan one needs an average of about kanji and there are okurigana besides that most graders in japan cant read a newspaper in fact many high schoolers struggle with it the human brain most certainly does not shut off after learning words this is clearly a publicity stunt being done by someone trying to get on the federal or state payroll to make curriculum years later hes rolling in dough and the kids are more confused than ever this has been going on for decades now
IAmA,not_removed,this sounds a lot like hooked on phonics source my mother bought me hooked on phonics how is the phoneme farm method different
IAmA,not_removed,i have been arguing for a while now with my managers at the english school in japan i teach at that memorizing words these letters go together and make cat is faulty but as its how japanese is taught they figure they know how japanese kids learn do you think that this would be appropriate to introduce in an esl environment or since there are so many other factors at play vocabulary acquisition being the biggest i can think of that this may be too high level for most esl learners or if you havent considered it want some feedback if my coworkers or i try to implement it thank you for this as someone who loves reading i always am mazes by my peers who think its too much work because they never developed the toolbox to be successful early on
IAmA,not_removed,so phonics basically i was wondering why they seem to have fallen out of style
IAmA,not_removed,is the case that nearly of americas kids read below grade level or rather do of americas kids read above grade level who decides what gradelevel reading looks like
IAmA,not_removed,to start im pretty impressed with your appespecially that it includes a speech component for the child which is something that many all other phonicsbased apps are missing how responsive is the speech element if the child mispronounces does it correct after playing around a little i dont think its actually speech responsive if thats something you can add in the future it would be amazing one critique on your presentation of your workfirst im a fervent believer in phonics over whole language or balanced literacythe research supports phonics first but i think youre creating a bit of a straw man when you say that most kids are being taught to read sight words only most kids are being taught sight words with some phonics incidentals after they learn a word see the picture of the cat look at the word underneath this word is cat later the c makes a k sound its not a strong base and it leaves gaps in the childrens knowledge and decoding skills that make it impossible for many of them to become proficient and fluent readers thats the real problem not that kids are being taught by memorization alone because even the whole language believers at least pretend to include phonics in their curriculumthey just dont put it in the proper place to give kids a strong foundation for reading there are many many phonicsfirst programs out there that are great and effective and have been for years jolly phonics ortongillingham primary phonics challpopp phonics letterland structural reading method but this is the first time ive seen it done so well in an app congratulations and thanks make more stuff
IAmA,not_removed,can you explain why you think your method of teaching reading skills is superior to the phonics method as far as im aware phonics is the most effective teaching method for reading skills and is the way i and many of my peers learned how to read i also highly doubt your assertion that most public school systems teach reading skills using the whole word method that method was indeed tried here in ohio for about years back in the early and was retired when it became obvious that years worth of students couldnt read at their grade level this is old territory also can you comment on why your program is so narrowly focused on such a tiny part of the proper development of reading skills while phonemic awareness is important to the development of reading skills its a very narrow subset of phonological awareness in general focusing on only phonemes does not reveal the larger picture in terms of reading skills we need to be focusing on the entirety of phonological skills which include phonemic skill httpreadinguoregoneduresourcesbibrpaconceptspdf httpwwwreadingfirstvirginiaedupdfsphonspelhandoutpdf also your method without any focus on phonics is merely moving the goalpost from a whole word method to a segment word method its the same thing just a smaller chunk of the word instead of the whole thing phonics on the other hand gives children the skills to recognize that sounds individual letters make then combinations of letters then whole words seems like a far better method just by logic phoneme teaching methods seem to me to be like trying to teach someone the order of operations in math when they dont even know what numbers are yet
IAmA,not_removed,when will pokemon go come out thank you for your time
IAmA,not_removed,i am a reading researcher and longtime reddit lurker i am writing with concern you seem to suggest that there are few good beginning reading programs available at all is this what you mean if so i think this is an unfair statement there are many programsnot designed by methat use similar methods and have causal evidence why is your idea any better i have the impression you think most american schools are using a whole language approach to reading am i understanding correctly if so that is incorrect your study involved schools but as many thoughtful readers pointed out these effectswhatever their sizecannot permit causal statements so are you arguing that your results show this program does work
IAmA,not_removed,your thread says that nearly of americas children read below grade level but the study you linked to only shows grade are there other studies you base your claim off or is the title accidentally too vague
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to be called out by a bunch of teachers for making up reasons why kids cant read
IAmA,not_removed,do you really think you know better than hundreds of thousands of educators and mountains of research are you just another big money shill trying to sell another reform snake oil tonic we do not use whole word where in the world did you get that from when was the last time you stepped into a classroom no one has used that method in over years if its so antiquated how did it work for you there are already very smart people working on a solution to this problem at xprize technology will never replace actual real world teachers for every student that has a true difficulty there needs to be a real person not some computer just making a student go through loops of the same curriculum over and over again that doesnt work standard chinese has symbols so how do they learn it we dont need people like you trying to milk money from the federal government teet seriously thanks for your effort but get real if you believe the statistics maybe you need your eyes examined
IAmA,not_removed,i teach in an elementary school and have years of data that call that number into extreme question but lets say that was accurate couldnt you argue the metrics for determining at grade level are way off
IAmA,not_removed,i come from australia and for many years they used the whole word reading method as it seems they still do in america fortunately for me my childrens school uses mostly phonetics coupling with thrass charts for both reading and spelling httpwwwthrasscomau are those charts similar to the data you have in your phoneme farm method i also taught them to read at the very beginning of primary school using phonics but with singing for example i first made sure they knew the sounds of the alphabet and the extra such as sh ch ph etc then i would show them a word for example carpet at first we would sing it slow pretend opera then fast i found this worked better than the gap bw each letter as it allowed for the flow of the sound of the word wondering if your approach does the same thing so far they are doing very well with my oldest having recently been given back her naplan results which is equivalent to your standardized testing the minimum was band and she was above band the highest they can show
IAmA,not_removed,im in college and i dont like reading i just dont like it i read news articles anecdotes etc but i cant stand reading more than about pages of anything i get lost or zone out then i realize ive been reading on autopilot and give up its not that i have difficulty understanding the text i just get incredibly distracted what advice could you give me to engage more while reading also what is your favorite preparation of a grilled cheese sandwich
IAmA,not_removed,are you actually using the simpsons in the phoneme farm my kid just started grade and is a voracious reader so much so the school wanted to know what we were doing because hes actually getting other kids in his class to read my method was simple i go to our local used book store and buy any comicgraphic novel thats simpsons related occasionally wallace and gromet or the bone series as well but primarily its simpsons material which he loves hes got a bookshelf filled with old simpsons material also hes got his own cheap computer and when he asks a question i make him google it to help improve his googlefu he can get the answer to any question he has usually with just a few spelling checks from me
IAmA,not_removed,but theres nothing new about phonemes its how i learned to read both at school in the mid and from my parents giving me ancient mcguffey readers why did it get discarded
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a pc version planned
IAmA,not_removed,has it always been like this when i started learning to read in public school years ago we were learning what im assuming were phonemes and then combined that with spelling lessons that i think combined both worlds of recognizing words but also understanding how they are put together i think i might have been very lucky
IAmA,not_removed,have you specifically used this game with special needs kids or kids with speech delays i ask because this is how i haveam teaching my son to read and it certainly works better than teaching sight words my son is autistic and has a serious speech delayhe has a hard time making many sounds but recognizes them all if he understands the sounds in a word he can put it together he is and in grade
IAmA,not_removed,my stepson is in the grade and is at a third grade reading level in mississippi children have to pass a reading comprehension test in third grade to move on to fourth grade my stepson barely passed and has struggled with reading ever since we help him as much as we can we read with him in front of him etc we let him read whatever he wants at this point as long as he reads for twenty minutes a day however he just doesnt comprehend or remember what hes reading its like hes reading but hes not paying attention he also uses whole word a lot except now hell see the beginning of a word and then guess the rest when its not a word he memorized when he was younger example instead of saying matter hell say math because he recognizes the mat as math and doesnt bother trying to read it were in a small town and the school and the reading counselor dont have a solution except to just have him read for twenty minutes a day and kind of force him into older books he chose the first percy jackson book for his reading fair project due after thanksgiving break the reading counselor said not to let him change the book once its chosen and to make him read it for him to complete this book in time he will have to read ten pages a day everyday with chapters on weekends thats hours a night at his desk reading out loud never getting playtime because of how much he struggles with reading will this program help kids like him who are struggling this much with reading or is this only for younger children
IAmA,not_removed,if read below grade level is the standard just set too high for the ages and developmental levels of kids typically in those grades edit also is this whole word method new or something im and i was taught by something like the phoneme method
IAmA,not_removed,why have american schools adopted whole word method as opposed to breaking down the word into its simplest sounds that culminate in the eventual sound of the whole word i was taught to read phonetically i had no idea american schools teach their kids to recognize whole words as apposed identifying the phonetic makeup of the word when i get stuck on the spelling of a certain word i run through the rules i learned as a child regarding syllables phonetic rules etc i always manage to come out with the correct spelling or pretty close to it p i have not had much time for reading as of late but i have always been a strong and avid reader
IAmA,not_removed,hello ive got adhdpi and read at about the pace of a grader even on medication do you have any tips for people like me i like reading but its really frustrating
IAmA,not_removed,what if it isnt that read below but its that read above
IAmA,not_removed,have you published any evaluations of your technologymethod comparing it to others how do we know its better than alternatives
IAmA,not_removed,im curious how much of that is simply because they havent found something they legitimately enjoy reading i know personally if i dont enjoy something im reading i can barely focus on the easy words like the i couldnt imagine trying to read for content something thats boring me to tears however stick something in front of me that i enjoy and ill absolutely devour it and make an effort to ensure i know every bit of whats happening including ensuring i learn any words i didnt know i know throughout grade school most of the curriculum fell firmly into that first category and reading those books were tantamount to torture but when there were books i enjoyed they not only were easy to read but i still remember them so many years later so what im asking is whats the possibility that a portion or even most of that are reading below level simple because the material isnt captivating to them memorizing words is what i did with material i hated but learning words is what i did with material i enjoyed even when the words were the same
IAmA,not_removed,is this issue geographically located to a few areas my daughters district in minnesota is right around grade level or better for so is it really a teaching issue or more of a kid family economic and location based issue
IAmA,not_removed,so basically the phonics i learned back in the were the right method and what we have now is not working color me shocked
IAmA,not_removed,in phoneme farm we start with sounds first we teach kids to recognize the individual sounds of language called phonemes there are in english then we teach them to associate these sounds with letters and words i am so happy to hear this when i started reading i was very afraid you werent going to be using the right definition of phoneme i was afraid it was going to be the plain spell it out associating graphemes with the sounds thing that is stupid im so happy that it uncovers the abstraction between phonemes graphemes words even a lot of adults would do well to learn this even here on reddit spoken language is first and a writing is a layer on top of the language the letters arent the sounds they are representations there are more than sounds in the language though phonemes sounds a bit low to me i count roughly in my head though it depends on dialects and such
IAmA,not_removed,hello dr colvard i have a question if i may as a selftaught reader in my midteens i used a technique where id play audiobooks alongside the actual books themselves and it gave me a better understanding overall of how words were read and how english as a whole worked has this technique ever been used in schools public or private that youve been aware of and if so how successful were they
IAmA,not_removed,is this another riff on teaching phonics or is it different some how if it is different how
IAmA,not_removed,has there been any research that shows kids who have the choice on what to read wind up with a better reading level i remember having to read the worst books growing up especially during summer reading when i got to read a book i actually liked i really enjoyed it but the bad books made me feel burnt out ps please ensure where the red fern grows is nowhere near your game
IAmA,not_removed,dr colvard dont you find itgrossthat youre using your position of privilege to assume the role of white savior
IAmA,not_removed,im a new parent daughter is months old now what can i do to help her succeed in reading ive already started reading simple books to her and talk to her as much as i can anything else
IAmA,not_removed,what if instead of video games we had them read more books
IAmA,not_removed,our kids arent learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong hmmm im in my and i read well my parents read well if antique methods dont work how do you account for their previous success are children somehow different today
IAmA,not_removed,can you rename it to game for kids who cant read good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too
IAmA,not_removed,so basically just went back to doing things the proper way before modern education completely shit the bed and fucked everything up my grandparents and parents were taught to read by sounding things out yknow the nonpatented laypersons name for your method this is how i was taught and was always well ahead of my grade level with reading at i still read better than a lot of people my age also you know what makes a huge difference giving your kid books to practice reading for fun instead of plunking them down with the tv video games or ipad you dont need games to learn things all of this making learning fun bullshit is preparing kids for a sad sad shock when they try to enter the real world and be functioning adults seems this ama really isnt anything more than advertising for your app youre just reverting back to an older more effective method and trying to brand it as some great innovative development how exactly is this a wonderful new breakthrough
IAmA,not_removed,does anyone else find it ironic that theres a major grammatical error in the title of this
IAmA,not_removed,teamed up with a producer youre right reading and writing skills must be going down to the tubes
IAmA,not_removed,why dont we cull of the population then im so sick of these oxygen wasting retards wasting oxygen what about all the kids who are in grade and read at a freshman college level or graders who read at a post graduate level what about them thats probably about of the students what do they get shit on shit on yet more by the us education system the same education system which completely ignores or whitewashes huge sections of us and world history in many districts the same education which tells kids that jesus was walking around with dinosaurs and dare not to the evil drugs and dont have sex until youre married and all that horseshit the us is infamous for worldwide instead more of this failed no retard left behind bullshit why dont we focus more on that top who actually have any potential worth a shit to develop in the first place these are never going to grow up to do shit but take out the fucking garbage so why not stop with this reading bullshit and teach them how to mow the fucking lawn
IAmA,not_removed,what of the math level on par no
IAmA,not_removed,can you do this again when you release it for android i will forget about this otherwise
IAmA,not_removed,what makes your program different from already available ones like wwwstarfallcom
IAmA,not_removed,why not on android you are really gimping the potential market limiting it to iphones and ipads unless the target market is parents since they will be the ones buying it still a lot of kids have cheap android devicetablets a lot dont have hella expensive iphones and ipads
IAmA,not_removed,if of kids are below the old standard are they not the new standard
IAmA,not_removed,did you go to hollywood upstairs medical college too ha
IAmA,not_removed,are teachers really to blame vs the screen time that kids experience now
IAmA,not_removed,i have learned in a japanese course that i took that in chinese you are expected to know characters how is this even possible if the human brain can only hold around symbols
IAmA,not_removed,this will probably be buried and i would hope that this has already been thought through but i feel like i need to say it just make sure the game is actually a game and not a chore disguised as a game this goes more for older children than very young ones ive worked in game design and ive seen this more times than i can count a game to teach kids typing lets start with typing and try and build a game around it i see the same thing with math reading languages etc the gameplay is boring and people dont want to play it because its just a worksheet all dolled up think about games like skyrim zelda grim fandango or indie exploration games that have a lot of text because they cant afford voice actors there is usually a lot of reading involved in those games it tricks kids into reading because it contributes to the fun instead of trying to be the fun if you want to make a game that truly engages children makes them want to come back for more it needs to be good on its own and find a way to incorporate reading comprehensionword defining as a mechanic and not the central role of the game i dont know what age group is being targeted but i do know that if the game doesnt have fun mechanics it wont have a long life good luck i cant wait to see what kind of awesome stuff you guys put out tldr make a game that can be good without reading and make it an important mechanic not the central gameplay focus if kids know its not just a game and that its for learning there will be unconscious opposition by older children
IAmA,not_removed,wouldnt it just be easier to have their parents read to and with them
IAmA,not_removed,why are we doing such a bad job of teaching reading our kids arent learning to read primarily because our teaching methods are antiquated and wrong could i ask has this always been the case im confused by the phrase below grade it makes it sound like of kids have reading ability below the grade we would expect historically which would indicate that we actually used to teach kids better in the past am i wrong if i am what does below grade actually mean and how has reading progress fared over the last few generations
IAmA,not_removed,is there a direct correlation to the percentage of unplanned pregnancies ive seen way too many people who really arent qualified to raise a hamster let alone a human yet theyre allowed to have broods of wild apechildren
IAmA,not_removed,its ridiculous to claim that the lack of reading proficiency in this country is due to the whole word reading approach further school teachers across the country are required to teach phonics and phonemic awareness this instruction starts in kdg and goes through grade there are numerous programs that teach phonemes including explode the code the wilson reading program great leaps and read what makes your program so different that you would get a ama rather than a specialist who has devoted their life to reading
IAmA,not_removed,how many of americans noticed you left out a with in your title
IAmA,not_removed,its statistics like this that should make you think carefully about the actual classification system you are using if of people are below normal do you think you may have defined normal incorrectly
IAmA,not_removed,it breaks my heart that this is the situation anywhere my family read to me as a child avidly and encouraged me to enjoy the journey in each story reading wasnt a chore in my house it was fun it was something we looked forward to and my mother was raising me alone while working insane hours just to keep a roof over our heads when she didnt have time my grandmother would make time to read the ugly duckling will always have a special place in my heart i consider myself very lucky in school i was ahead of the game because of this attention i think you are definitely right about the connection of hearing vs memorizing it was torture listening to other kids struggle so so hard with medium difficulty words in high school canterbury tales canterbury torture for the kids they were embarrassed with their comprehension rate but the teachers had to keep up with a lesson plan and couldnt spare the time to make sure that everyone was grasping the lesson good luck with the venture i truly hope it is wildly successful the kids deserve the opportunity do you have any suggestions on how individuals can help their community in addition to your app will it be available for android
IAmA,not_removed,no android feelsbadman
IAmA,not_removed,do the current writers of the simpsons know they suck are they doing their best and failing or are they capable of good writing but choosing to produce garbage do they ever feel shame over tainting such a proud legacy is there any self awareness over there at all
IAmA,not_removed,whats the age range for your game my twoyear old is obviously a genius and im hoping to help him along do you recommend any particular resources beyond your game thanks for your time
IAmA,not_removed,hello and thanks for taking the time to do this growing up i was an avid reader partly because i enjoyed reading and partly because i really didnt have anything else to do no netflix no video games none of that now my little sister who is a decade younger than me almost never reads shes definitely got the ability to read at and maybe even above her grade level the thing is she has zero interest in reading shed much rather play xbox or watch netflix anything but read my father tries to force her to read minutes a day but she usually skips it shell put in minutes of work to avoid minutes of reading and i just dont get why what can i do if anything to incentivize reading ive tried finding stories that fit her interests ive tried sitting down and reading to her not sure what else i can do i dont need my sister to become an avid reader i just want her to understand the benefits of reading that reading isnt some punishment handed out by parents or teachers that it has real value
IAmA,not_removed,im getting this for my kids now ever think that there is a vastly underdeveloped market for childrens games ive been looking for educational games but none of them use any sort of proven psychological methods for childhood development most of them are just jigsaw puzzles and junk from the early dos days number munchers and the like thank you for your work look forward to more releases there is a market and its basically me you got one customer
IAmA,not_removed,if of kids are reading below grade level shouldnt the reading grade level be adjusted down to match them or else why is it called the grade level if only a minority of students can read at that grades level
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think is the primary cultural block facing many kids in the united states today what really drives home the thought of reading isnt that important in the minds of young people today
IAmA,not_removed,i think i understand how dissecting words into phenomes would allow for a much faster read but how does it impact digestion of such information if the brain doesnt piece together these sounds into meaning we may as well be reading another language the more i see articles and evidence concerning our childrens reading the more i hope i can help my own to understand im reading the hobbit to them currently replete with voices and hand gestures im not sure how else to get them excited suggestions
IAmA,not_removed,as a doctor with a specialization in vision it seems your field is only tangentially related to reading education i was wondering how you bridged that gap between your field and reading education as well as bringing together a functioning development team for the sake of this project
IAmA,not_removed,why dont you correct the ironic grammatical error in your headline
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your ama have you considered working with other online teaching tools to help codeacademy is one i was thinking of which may work and im sure there are others
IAmA,not_removed,what is it like working with a producer of the simpsons hy did he or she choose to produce outside tv and film
IAmA,not_removed,how can i test myself to know my reading level and how can i improve upon it
IAmA,not_removed,hi what do you think contributes or is the cause of this problem
IAmA,not_removed,my entire education until secondary of high school was done in french thus i was thought how to read in french first however i remember being taught the different sounds of the language before we attempted to read the language so i dont really know how people were taught how to read in english if i were to teach my children to read in any language what kind of methods should i use
IAmA,not_removed,how do you improve reading comprehension im studying for the gre and am realizing i peaked in high school
IAmA,not_removed,hello dr colvard thank you for doing this ama what are some daily practices my fiance can implement as a grade teacher she is amazing at what she does but it is always nice to have tips from someone from a different field
IAmA,not_removed,will there be any cost associated with the app like a flat rate just for the app or inapp purchases i have a year old son and would like to try this app out for him i would also like to try hooked on phonics as it truly did work for me and was at a college reading level in grade any thoughts on the hop program i know its been around since the at least
IAmA,not_removed,i used to read a lot because people read to me and then reading was encouraged not just at school but from other places i actually cared about thats the key right there not a different system to go into the already broken system want kids to read let them read what they want stop fussing about appropriate content and just let the kids enjoy books that was the biggest detriment i saw to the love of reading growing up youd be in grade wanting to read something that feel mature to you and all the books feel like they are written for first graders content wise
IAmA,not_removed,how do i teach myself to become a better reader even though i am an adult
IAmA,not_removed,in all seriousness has teaming up with a producer from the simpsons brought anything interesting to the game you wouldnt have had otherwise also isnt it generally agreed that there are standard phonemes in english with blends and diphthongs raising the number significantly i ask because as a former esl teacher many nonenglish speakers have difficulty forming more complex sounds in english due to the sheer number and subtlety of difference does your game just address the ones produced by the letters of the alphabet on their own
IAmA,not_removed,hooked on phoneics want to use my awesome name feel free
IAmA,not_removed,the dumbing down of america by charlotte iserbyt have you read it
IAmA,not_removed,what are the percentages of kids that read above grade level my sons in grade and is at a grade reading level is that uncommon
IAmA,not_removed,when or where was this standard of english testing implemented i am curious because i learnt english very differently than current preschoolers seem to
IAmA,not_removed,does the game just open with a screen that says your parents suck
IAmA,not_removed,this is something im a bit selfish about but i am so glad to hear that the whole word method is a failure i grew up in france at a time when we were taught the phoneme farm method and in my last year of primary school it was swapped to the whole word one as a recommendation by the french government i noticed that people around me whom were taught with the whole word are often worse readers and as im teaching in a video game school for yearsold people i notice they have high difficulties reading something to the class is the phoneme farm method more effective also in understaing what we are reading it seems that my student are not able to understand things they are reading my gf is alos telling me she doesnt understand any piece of text she doesnt read only to herself because she has to try to pronounce the word instead of understanding their meaning to reformulate does the phoneme farm method help to understand or just read with ease even though those two ideas are higly intricated sorry for my english im trying
IAmA,not_removed,at what age do kids typically learn their abcs my son just turned and has just been able to write all of his letters in order and in both uppercase and lowercase at is that ahead or behind
IAmA,not_removed,how do you account for different dialects does it ever come up as an issue recently i was reading some article i forget about what exactly written from a probably britishpov and it included a list of vowels and words which had them in the table they had some of the same sounds were separated ɑ into two rows and some different sounds were combined ɑ and æ in the same row thankfully i was familiar with ipa so i knew which sounds they meant but if you werent familiar with ipa it would definitely be confusing when learning french this came up occasionally too at one point my textbook said not to pronounce a like but to pronounce a like has this come up as an issue what dialect does the program teach
IAmA,not_removed,suggestions for older kids i have a year old who says he likes to read but he struggles with long pages of text and some grammar part of his problem is adhd impatience fear of being bored but in some cases hes obviously struggling with the mechanics of reading thanks for the ama
IAmA,not_removed,my wife and i have been teaching our five year old using precisely this method its so nice to see someone advocating for phonetic learning do you think youll be able to get any traction from the corrupt quagmire that is the public school system what do you view as your present and future opposition to this proposed transition are there any supplemental books or material you recommend thanks
IAmA,not_removed,i have two kids one that is and one that is the older one is in preschool and learning his alphabet and such whats the best thing i can do for him to start him down the path of being a good reader are there signs that i can really start him learning to read or are there signs that ive started too early
IAmA,not_removed,would you recommend parents with children struggling with reading to use this method if theyre taught the other method in school do you know if a conflict may occur or should parents just try to have the school implement it
IAmA,not_removed,wow my phd is on the very topic of games and literacy can i ask how does your view of reading comprehension play into the role of current literacy standards and do you think that formalizing and structuring of reading comprehension activities with video games be of benefit
IAmA,not_removed,good morning dr colvard i feel that every new generation have less and less bookworms do you believe this is caused more by our archaic teaching methods or do you feel technology has affected our attention span so much that has made the act of reading a book a daunting task thanks a lot for your research and contribution to society
IAmA,not_removed,arent most adult level reading aimed at grade proficiency are you solely focused on early childhood development or is lifelong learning in your foreseeable goals
IAmA,not_removed,dr is the symbol limit a universal thing japanese language requires one to know about character to be considered averagehighschoolgraduatelevel literate i believe chinese language also have a similar standard
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about programs like the derek zoolander center for kids who cant read good and wanna learn to do other stuff good too
IAmA,not_removed,im confused how is this method different from methods like hooked on phonics
IAmA,not_removed,didnt even read the story is that sad lol
IAmA,not_removed,hows this different from hooked on phonics that product that claimed to help kids read but was ultimately proven not to be effective i was taught to be a good reader by reading not only in the classroom but at home where a love of reading was given to me by my parents
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for the time you take to teach our children we have been using our product in schools our approach to phonics has been successful both in schools where the majority of the children come from nonenglish speaking homes as well as from more affluent backgrounds our data shows that children who enter the class in the lower percentile of agematched readers are in the top percentile after using phoneme farms for year additionally children who are already in the upper percentile are in the top after using phoneme farms for the year thank you again for your work
IAmA,not_removed,good morning i am so glad you asked that question we are currently working on it for android systems as well it will be ready in the near future
IAmA,not_removed,a childs future should not be determined by the zip code they happen to be born into or who their parents are but what platform they are onthats another story
IAmA,not_removed,asking the real questions
IAmA,not_removed,one potential explanation from my limited knowledge of the brain is chunking the brain is extremely good at building up fundamental parts into larger constructs and memorizing those as a single unit much like was explained with phonemes it could be that your brain has encoded more fundamental symbols into many different chinese characters assuming of course the limit he was talking about was fundamental symbols
IAmA,not_removed,seriously this seems like a faulty premise to me im thinking its less the education system failing the kids and more of parents being terrible parents and not reading to their kids encouraging them to read andor them just not caring about their kids education
IAmA,not_removed,i was told the chinese kids just memorize the words for the first years in school to build their vocabulary sighted kids that is but for nonsighred learners theres an advantage in chinese phonetic spelling in braille only about sounds so as long as you can hear well and speak well it sounds like a lot easier system
IAmA,not_removed,my guess is that you consciously or unconsciously break the characters down somehow to memorize them theres probably a structure to them that your mind can use i know thats how i memorize music you find patterns and then remember the pattern i dont remember i remember that its a chopped up a natural minor scale and that theres an f at the end of the bar that doesnt match the pattern the next bar does the same thing except up a whole step and then it jumps up another fourth halfway through the third bar is two triplets of an a minor triad and then a specific pattern that ive memorized and thats the start of a piece that is very musically transgressive and a pain in the ass to play as a result so the chunks are unusually small and words are the same for me i never really used phonetic patterns beyond doublechecking my pronunciation i forget exactly when i learned to read whether it was in kindergarten or before then i do know that my parents read to me a lot from a very young age and my mom always told me a bedtime story often one that she made up on the spot within a fairly short span after i started reading id intuitively grasped enough of a structure that it wasnt just big lists of words and definitions or letters and sounds im not sure how to go about teaching that though since i mostly just read a lot of books as soon as i learned to read and my reading improved over time as a result of practice
IAmA,not_removed,chinese people dont know that many though a typical educated chinese knows less than thousand symbols its very well known that functional literacy is like thousand characters
IAmA,not_removed,dont chinese symbols i know japanese do build off each other example 木 is tree and 林 is forest or how you can draw one symbol and then just add an additional line to add on to that word so technically by symbol ht could be a cross as one then the two diagonal lines as another then say you add one more diagonal line that isnt a new symbol just a new word
IAmA,not_removed,im not a scientist but maybe this answer might help chinese characters are not entirely unique i learned chinese for a year and there was a point when it became easier to learn new words compared to when i first started i think this has to do with how chinese characters are composed of other chinese characters ex the chinese character for woodtree is 木 the chinese character for woodsforest is 林 two wood two trees ultimately theres a chinese word 森林 means forest which as you can see is 木 characters put together also in chinese there are the concepts of radicals for example woman looks like 女 horse looks like 马 and is pronounce ma with a third tone the chinese character for mom is 妈 and is also pronounced ma but with the first tone the character is just a woman character next to a ma sound character similarly the chinese character for good is 好 which is a woman character next to a child character the point is when youre learning chinese characters you really arent learning however many thousand characters youre learning a smaller subset of characters and putting them together to make other characters
IAmA,not_removed,he said by gradeif i read that correctly
IAmA,not_removed,there are very very few schools that dont teach some form of phonemic awareness if you look at the ccss and even most maybe all statespecific nonccss standards you are going to see it enshrined in the language meaning that schools really have to teach it this form of instruction has been popular for ages too like since the seventies i am highly skeptical that somebody is now attempting to sell it as an updated method of instruction
IAmA,not_removed,my daughter is just starting third grade every week for the last two years she has homework packets with sight words that she has to learn the meaning and how to spell im the one teaching her the sounds of the letters not her teachers i hate teaching the english language btw
IAmA,not_removed,his response to you was what telemarketers are taught to do you can see a mile away that someone is selling something money is going into someones pockets all of this was written by someone who writes for infomercials
IAmA,not_removed,hello this is an excellent point your children are quite fortunate to have you and the schools they are attending the overwhelming majority of children in los angeles schools are taught to sight read i understand that the manhattan school district has recently adopted a new reading system which is a sight reading program these sight reading programs are ubiquitous in schools because they give the delusion of early reading success while leaving children with non of the requisite skills to become excellent readers there is a great deal of conversation about phonics but when it is taught it is taught poorly and sporadically this is why of graduating seniors from la schools read so poorly that they are unprepared for the academic rigors of community college data from the national assessment of reading progress shows that of grade children read below grade level
IAmA,not_removed,i think youre misinterpreting the distinction between whole word method and what you call sounding it out when you tell a child to sound a word out enough times theyre learning how a single word is pronounced and then replicating that result until they know that pattern x is the word which is pronounced in a certain way their brain sees a shape composed of a distinct pattern of letters and because theyve sounded it out a couple hundred times before they dont really read the word this time but just replicate the prior result shape sound word in this way the number of words they can read efficiently is limited by the number of shapes a childs brain can distinguish and memorize by using phonemes they read each word as a distinct pattern of sounds rather than letters and in doing so they avoid the whole word acquisition model whose weaknesses dr op is seeking to correct they only have to remember the phonemes to read efficiently rather than the many thousands of words of the english language
IAmA,not_removed,i think a lot of this depends on how early a child is exposed to reading i assumed it was my job to teach the basics before my lil nippers got to school thats years and lot of dr seuss books i can remember some of them to this day oldest child is both of mine were reading before they were in kindergarten if kids are coming into k cold no awareness of phonemes or sounds incomplete knowledge of the alphabet thats a problem and it does happen if your local schools do kindergarten assessments sign up to volunteer and see what the schools are dealing with you can readily see the kids who have been exposed to a lot of reading at home maybe been to a good prek program vs the kids who just played without much structure for years
IAmA,not_removed,yeah seems faulty premise there i mean isnt this what hooked on phonics was in the my grandmother taught me how to read using phonics years ago so this isnt revolutionary stuff
IAmA,not_removed,my youngest attended an elementary school one highly rated which opted in the third grade to quit teaching spelling because the spellcheckers will do it for them i was furious my year old still struggles with spelling
IAmA,not_removed,i found this interesting as well i live in semirural indiana and both of my children have been learning through a phonetic method both of my children read well beyond their grade level and most of their peers read at least their own grade level i have trouble believing nationally from the linked website of our grade children are below proficient with reading maybe im sheltered but given of graduating seniors now move on to college i suspect these reading proficiency statistics are skewed
IAmA,not_removed,sightreading is this like the think method of musical instruction in the music man
IAmA,not_removed,i copied this from a reply i made in this thread earlier basically this guy is just trying to sell his product i work as an exceptional childrens teacher for children with mild to moderate disabilities i specialize in reading i have spent hundreds of hours in trainings and have been in many school systems i have never been in a single system or training where the whole word system was currently being used years ago this was the case on a large scale i think you will find that today schools who exclusively use whole word training is a vast minority for example i personally as many teachers and specialist do begin teaching children by using the easiest phonemes and working up to harder blends bl sl etc vowel teams ea oa etc digraphs th sh etc trigraphs tch etc as children age we move on to how syllables effect words especially vowel sounds and doubled consonants however the english language is a complicated language at best and many common words to not follow phonetic rules because of this some words must be taught as whole words commonly referred to as sight words tricky words or dolch words these are words like the was one etc they are imperative to reading fluently but cannot be sounded out in other words not all whole word instruction is bad i think i naively thought this ama would be about these topics not about a singular app one size does not fit all in reading its scary to me to think that parents may read this and think this will solve all their problems edit i typed this on my phone i made a lot of mistakes
IAmA,not_removed,im a nonnative mandarin speaker i know about characters but those characters are all broken up into a much fewer set of radicals that can give you clues as to meaning and pronunciation
IAmA,not_removed,oh id love to hear about chinese in that context my guess is for sighted learners there will always be sightwords in chinese you just need to learn to figure how to decipher the parts of the letter which part is the root and so on whereas for notsight readers of chinese its a lot easier learn the sounds chinese is spelled phonetically in braille so theres a clear advantage
IAmA,not_removed,this is a terrific question and should be addressed as you suggest studies demonstrate the critical importance of early language acquisition are abundant children from impoverished backgrounds can enter kindergarten having heard as many as million fewer words than children from middle or upper class environments furthermore children from underprivileged backgrounds tend to know and use half as many words as more advantaged children by the age of these chilling observations expose the unsettling reality of what has been described as word poverty this underscores the importance of reaching children from impoverished backgrounds as early in life as possible this is a very strong argument for preschool programs which emphasize the acquisition of language skills we created phoneme farm to help children improve language skills by teaching them how to identify individual sounds within words this is the best possible preparation for a young reader as maryanne wolf director of center for reading and language research at tufts university has stated the sheer evidence showing the efficacy of phoneme awareness and explicit instruction in decoding for early reading skills could fill a library wall
IAmA,not_removed,these are extremely salient questions and i cannot help but notice that they have gone unanswered by dr colvard as a school psychologist that serves a large urban district in the midwest including multiple prek and early elementary schools my bs detector went off while reading the original post while i certainly cannot speak for the curriculum and instruction in california or other states outside of my own i too would like to know what evidence dr colvard has that schools arent teaching phonemic awareness and phonics skills particularly at prek and elementary school level and have opted instead to teach whole word reading in addition his claim that a large percentage of students in the fourth grade are reading below proficient is quite spurious as not being proficient on the naep does not equate to being below grade level expectations the naep is the test that dr colvard is using to indicate that a majority of students are below proficient whatever that means in fact being proficient on the naep is much more likely to indicate that the student is performing above grade level standards and expectations tom loveless of the brookings institute recently penned a piece regarding criticisms of the naep you can read it here while i certainly want our students to achieve as high as they possibly can i feel that this ama is being presented in a somewhat deceptive manner in order to sell a product while i have no reason to doubt the effectiveness of his program at this time i do not feel that dr colvard is being completely honest about reading achievement in the us in order to push this program
IAmA,not_removed,replied to another comment about ops claims about la schools using whole word instruction here tldr whole word instruction is not the problem op claims even at the schools theyve worked with
IAmA,not_removed,talk to your colleagues in ny most schools there have transitioned to sightreading in early childhood education
IAmA,not_removed,i find its mostly educators who strongly dislike the education system and want change but then when someone from outside of the education system criticizes the education system its more often than not seen as an attack on teachers and educators how do we stop this dogchasingtail circular argument or are teachers the only ones who know enough to have insight does someone need to become a teacher to have an opinion i dont mean to be rude in any way i mean this with all sincerity it seems like any time someone who isnt a teacher has an idea a bunch of teachers take offense to it im not saying thats what youre doing here because youve taken specific issue with this specific person and youre of course entitled to all of that i just see this quite often this weariness by teachers to accept insight from anyone who isnt in class with the kids etc
IAmA,not_removed,first to be clear i am so grateful and respectful of the work you do the work that teachers do in schools across the country is heroic i apologize if anything i said came across as disrespectful the data that i have quoted comes from the national assessment of reading progress which as you know is a survey of the reading skills of grade children in every state in the us i realize that many teachers do teach phonics well yet many consultants we have worked with who are leading educators in the field have pointed out that whole word instruction often becomes a default method of teaching reading i agree completely that children should be given more time to learn to read before being expected to read to learn
IAmA,not_removed,this reminded me of something i have a lot of friends from countries like the netherlands and germany who learned english from watching tv shows in english with captions in their language thats how the english shows were shown in their country they heard the word in english while reading it in their native language once youre kids are confident at reading if you want them to start learning or improve a foreign language it could be a good idea to find shows in that language and have english captions running
IAmA,not_removed,extended lpt dont do this for shows you actually want to watch
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for catching that lol a friend of mine is helping with this and he left that out i need to get him on phoneme farms thanks
IAmA,not_removed,this needs to be higher
IAmA,not_removed,im having a hard time reading this comment did you intentionally do this or are you pointing out a mistake while also making a mistake yourself
IAmA,not_removed,what do you mean later im going to the park if you want to come me
IAmA,not_removed,it doesnt sound silly at all it is a very good question the national assessment of reading progress is conducted by the us department of education the statistics we have quoted regarding reading levels comes from data generated by these studies levels of reading proficiency are established by us department of education many states in the us have attempted to improve their low reading stats by simply lowering the bar of what is expected
IAmA,not_removed,thats american kids being compared to other kids globally its not that globally kids are reading below grade level just american kids
IAmA,not_removed,i guess it depends on where the baseline comes from maybe when those numbers were set we used a different method that worked better or maybe there was some kind of a demographic shift that threw off the average eg lots of english as a second language students who cant even speak english at grade level much less read it or maybe youre right and the numbers are completely arbitrary
IAmA,not_removed,if of americans are overweight cant we solve the problem by relabeling of americans as underweight
IAmA,not_removed,youve been asking great questions i wish upupsquest would have given a more thorough answer
IAmA,not_removed,but there is a hooked on phonics app already i have it
IAmA,not_removed,yes i am very familiar with this program and i laud this effort children who are falling behind in reading education i believe should be treated as a child with special needs and all focus should be on fostering their reading skills
IAmA,not_removed,be sure to make it at least times as big as the model
IAmA,not_removed,no but derek zoolander may be interested
IAmA,not_removed,the app is free and doesnt from what i can tell have any microtransactions seems like the dude is legitimately concerned about the state of reading in the us and just wants to help people
IAmA,not_removed,isnt that what a lot of amas are actor comes on to promote movie writer comes on to promote book philanthropist comes on to promote charity etc
IAmA,not_removed,you are completely right that the poorest way to teach a child to read is to begin by teaching them to memorize words teaching children the sounds of english language called phonemes will allow them to recognize sounds and words to blend sounds and to segment the sounds to make words the best thing to do as a parent is to spend a great deal of time reading to them and sit with them as they work on reading it does not matter at all what type of books you start with you simply want to create a literate environment thank you for your question
IAmA,not_removed,honestly youd be better off not using a system sit down with your kid and read to them all kids like being read to if you pick a story that is interesting to them instead of stressing out about the content in the story
IAmA,not_removed,damn i forgot how catchy that was
IAmA,not_removed,working memory and brain training games are an excellent way to keep the mind fresh just like anything else practice makes perfect if a program is interactive and verbal the downside does not outweigh the benefits children need to hear and to learn to use as many words early in life as possible thanks for this question
IAmA,not_removed,really i was born in china but left when i was six but even than i was starting to pick up a few things in the newspaper now i cant read any of it but i did keep in contact with a few friends back there and they all could read the newspaper by the time they were in grade easily i assume kanji is a lot harder than written chinese
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for touching on this topic the one thing human beings have in common is that we have a remarkable ability to hear recognize and reproduce sounds of language it makes perfectly good sense to anchor our learning of reading english to the element of language that is most instinctual using a phoneme to grapheme letter system for teaching the reading of english is certain to be the most effective way to teach new english learners our written language we have had great success with spanish speaking english language learners in los angeles
IAmA,not_removed,when people learn to read english as a second language they already know how to read in their first language the brain machinery that splits words into phonemes and associates them with symbols already exists when i learned english as second language i had to memorize lots of words at first because the orthography to me made no sense at all and was an incoherent mess my native language is spanish which has relatively few spelling irregularities like japanese only later did i see the patterns and heuristics people use to figure out how a written word even one that ive never heard before should be pronounced and im still surprised sometimes
IAmA,not_removed,do you get enough sleep do you exercise do you eat reasonably i personally notice much higher energy levels focus and productivity when the answer to these questions is yes
IAmA,not_removed,ive been saying this all over the thread you dont need a fucking snake oil salesmen to get your kid to read what you do is read to your damn kids find something they are interested in and read to them so many parents fail because they worry to much about the education value of the books or that the books have the right words in them or that were making our kids read the words in the right way and that programs need to be scaffold ed as they age its all fucking bullshit i grew up during the computer age since the time i was six years old just about every kids company in the world has been trying to sell education toys to kids to help them either do math better or read better or something else what are the chances this guy found the one that magically works where the rest are all bullshit unlikely you are doing the right thing your not trying to force your kid to like reading you are getting him into it by reading things he actually enjoys instead of the usual educational drivel kids are not stupid they realize that stories that are heavy handed with their lessons and phonics and other stuff are all boring and not enjoyable if reading is boring and not enjoyable of course kids are gonna try to run and get to their ipad so they can play a game also schools censor what kids can and cant read to much i feel like that along is the biggest thing keeping kids in north america back beyond any other thing sorry if this post seemed crude this kind of thing has bothered me for a long time
IAmA,not_removed,it didnt its a sales pitch
IAmA,not_removed,when she is of reasonable reading age you should begin withholding basic necessities food water etc to give her an increased incentive to learn and therefore survive
IAmA,not_removed,because apple has been throwing ipads and computers such as the iie at schools since the to help children or create a loyal customer base early take your pick
IAmA,not_removed,as a parent of elementary age children i can tell you that the public schools in my state dont teach wholeword
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your question the ideal age range is years for phoneme farms this program teaches phoneme awareness our next programs all of which are carefully scaffolded then teach children the correspondence between sounds and letters we recommend that program for ages years this program is already in schools and the app will be available by the end of the year the best resources beyond the game is the parent it is as simple as just taking the time to read stories with your child numerous studies have demonstrated that a childs reading ability is greatly enhanced when heshe hears language constantly
IAmA,not_removed,when established teaching curriculum that has been in place for decades lists criteria for a specific grade level and all of a sudden you see a trend of current students falling behind when for the last years this wasnt the case it makes perfect sense that for some reason the average kid is reading below average even more so when you consider other parts of the world have higher expectations for the same age group and are meeting those higher goals
IAmA,not_removed,not op but i can share what my wife and i did for our kids when my son was or he didnt show much interest in reading we would read stories to him and he was progressing in his ability to read but he just didnt think of reading to himself as a fun activity he would much rather watch cyberchase or play with his toys in order to provide an incentive we bought a roll of raffle tickets and set up a point system for every halfhour of doing school work or reading an ageappropriate book he could earn one ticket each ticket could then be redeemed for minutes of television or computer time in order to watch a halfhour cartoon then he needed to complete an hour of reading or other related work in order to watch a movie he had to complete three hours of reading the tickets made it easy for us to keep track of how much he had done and it gave him a concrete image of how much he had accomplished we were pretty strict about it too no tickets no tv within about six months or so he had become a reading convert and was spending more time reading recreationally now we have trouble keeping enough books on hand for him a few years later it became noticeable that he and his younger sisters would gravitate toward fiction for their recreational reading in order to encourage nonfiction reading my wife started a fruitbased program for each ageappropriate nonfiction book they read they got to cut out a picture of a piece of fruit to tape on the wall one month it might be lemons the next month it might be grapes after reaching a predetermined number of fruit cutouts they could choose a dessert made from that fruit for the family to share again the visual representation made easy tracking for all of us and the kids were excited about getting to choose what sort of reward they got basically we tried to tie rewards to the desired activity in this case reading while making their progress clear and visual the kids got immediate feedback on their progress while learning to look forward to the big payoff hidden under all of that though they were getting exposed to a wider selection of books and learning to love reading if i were a parent in your situation i would directly tie netflix or xbox use to her reading first set a certain amount of reading that she is expected to complete this could be based on time read for x minutes pages or chapters depending on what her skill level is this may require verification too which could be anything from asking a few questions about the story to having her write a short book report only after the reading requirement has been met would she be allowed to turn on the tv i personally prefer the uneven weight system that we used where minutes of work gets minutes of recreation because im mean that way but every child is different you have to be consistent though if she decides to do something other than read then she has made the decision to forgo netflix or xbox for the day depending on how stubborn she is it could take a while for her to get accustomed to that idea but i think its key rewards are determined by work
IAmA,not_removed,from an outside perspective what helped with my husband lol was him just seeing me reading a lot and eventually asked what i was reading i described the martian to him before the movie came out and he thought it sounded funny from the snippets i read to him that he read it and its been improving ever since i would say that if your father wants to encourage her to read why not you and him sit around and just read for a bit a day in plain view maybe yell at her to turn the damned tv down and get everyone else in your house involved even for short times peer pressure may do wonders
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for your kind words of encouragement i am so truly passionate about this because i believe every child should reach their full potential it is very true that most of the market is more often entertainment masquerading as education most of these programs teach a little of this and a little of that with no real focus what is needed are programs that are comprehensive evidencebased and carefully scaffolded so children learn quickly and are never presented with material they are not completely prepared to master
IAmA,not_removed,i liked the reader rabbit series as a kid particularly the pirate island game
IAmA,not_removed,if you still have a pc running xp some jumpstart games are compatible i dunno how old your kids are but grade was my favorite it was released through the learning company and i played many of their early titles definitely recommended
IAmA,not_removed,is it the professor pup one by matthew talty thats the only one i see and op had a link that didnt connect with no title for the app
IAmA,not_removed,there is a certain logic in what you say but do we want to solve our reading problem by lowering our standards to the lowest common denominator
IAmA,not_removed,no but it will be on my reading list now thanks
IAmA,not_removed,im curious about this too i hit grade reading level whatever that means sometime in elementary school too i used to think that meant graders must be dumb but maybe it just means that i was basically proficient
IAmA,not_removed,it is exceptional the most important thing is that he continues reading so the slope of his education continues to rise
IAmA,not_removed,id say ahead now skip the names of the letters and teach him the simple sounds of each letter and the short version of the vowels and hell soon be able to read phonetically
IAmA,not_removed,ahead get him leap frog letter factory and bob books and hell be on his way to reading
IAmA,not_removed,could this not just be because of the increased time spent on literacy do you have anything that prove causation with your platform how are your gains vs other platforms given the same time investment
IAmA,not_removed,our data shows that children who enter the class in the lower percentile of agematched readers are in the top percentile after using phoneme farms for year additionally children who are already in the upper percentile are in the top after using phoneme farms for the year all of them
IAmA,not_removed,is this data published or to be published anywhere in an actual study those sound nice but it is hard to tell what they mean if anything at all without a comprehensive description of your methodology and statistical testing for significance against control
IAmA,not_removed,wow those are really good numbers out of curiosity are these schools located nationwide east coast west coast also are there plans to try and develop higher level material i work with grade and i know we have some low lexile students that could benefit from something like this
IAmA,not_removed,none of that is a surprise phonics teaching methods have been proven for some time to be far more effective than whole word methods this isnt news to anyone that actually pays attention thats why most schools and school faculty want to teach using the phonics method rather than trying to gamify the experience so you can cash in on the sweet sweet education money you should try to campaign to force schools that are too clueless to use the proven methods of phonics rather than whole word nonsense
IAmA,not_removed,what separates this from things like hooked on phonics which have existed for years and explicitly teach reading via phonetics its been quite a long time but i learned reading via phonemes everyone i know did as well im not doubting the claim that kids cant read properly but it seems like kids are being taught whole words and then nobody else gives a shit to go any further is a bit exaggerated
IAmA,not_removed,what about compared to other methodstechnologies whats the control group look like
IAmA,not_removed,i wonder how native language affects the learning to read process overall for example in finnish language the alphabet is identical to phonetic alphabet and finland has usually done very well in pisa tests etc although there has been dropping during recent years and reading problems are increasing in finland as well
IAmA,not_removed,so statistically they could have moved from to to fit your data also of the top were already in the upper percentile before you even started
IAmA,not_removed,is there a way we can sign up to be notified of android availability my son started kindergarten yesterday and im very interested in this thanks
IAmA,not_removed,my kids school and every school in our area is dumping their expensive apple products and buying up androidchomebooks as fast as they can the apply tablets are each android equivalents are literally its a nobrainier really
IAmA,not_removed,any plans for windows its certainly the most common computer in the classroom look at httpswwwxamarincom to build windows ios android apps ask your ios dev if they can move to xamarin in order to maintain a single computer code base but deliver to all three
IAmA,not_removed,pc version
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair the iphone users most likely need it more
IAmA,not_removed,or if they have access to a device like this i graduate with my teaching degree in may and would like to teach in a low income school ive been to several through the last few years and many dont have access to ipads or iphones
IAmA,not_removed,i still think platform is a huge issue while it might hit of smartphone users most of the children who cannot read do not have an iphone schools are using chromebooks more than anything else now that ipads have proved faddish why not develop this as a web app that is optimized for mobile so most people could use it
IAmA,not_removed,as a fellow chinese learner this is definitely the case after my first months of learning it was rare to find a character component that i hadnt seen before in some form or another that being said there are precisely fundamental symbols in the english language so if the brain is doing that anyway which i would suspect it is then it seems like the phonemewhole symbol difference is a little more nuanced than the good doctor says in his intro
IAmA,not_removed,so basically instead of know individual digitsletters for the alphabet you know the alphabet as one whole
IAmA,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing and to be more specific each component of a chinese character such as the radical gives insight into the meaning so we dont completely depend on raw memorization when english words have latin roots its sometimes possible to infer the meaning of the word but english is a mix of latin and german origin i would speculate that this extra information assists in memorizing more characters with the number of phonemes in mandarin its easy to use auditory knowledge to augment reading eg 嗎 vs 媽 vs 馬 knowing 馬 and the radicals knowing the spoken forms of the other words gives you an idea of what the other two characters are and we know speech uses a completely different part of the brain than reading so theres a bit of parallel computing going on
IAmA,not_removed,this whole ama seems like a pitch for their product in lieu of the bad system currently in many the schools since selling that product to the school systems would make for some big coin so many people are questioning and disproving the ops points though with excellent relevant rebuttals and his in return dont really sell it for me even the top comment right now questions how widespread the sight method is being used and now suddenly its only in los angelas and manhattan and i mean i dont feel as though theres much to new with the phoneme system as is ive got a certificate in tesol and covering phonetics and their larger roll in language is a fairly basic principle one goes over with their students and if thats happening with international students of all ages i imagine the school systems would also cover phonetics at a base level not that i dont think the american system doesnt have its short falls i just feel that op is making an incredibly broad accusation and relying on the assumption that americans are dumb being true so that no one brings in their own observations in rebuttal of his
IAmA,not_removed,at what age should you read to your kids
IAmA,not_removed,many times lower literacy is generational its not that parents dont want to many cant i am a volunteer tutor in an adult literacy center and the most common reason by far people give for wanting to improve their reading is so they can read to their children or grandchildren
IAmA,not_removed,except that a lot of these kids that cant read well grow up and become parents who still cant read well parents might not be reading to their kids because they arent confident in their reading skills not because theyre terrible parents
IAmA,not_removed,do you think the parents also hate reading and english what makes you think the parents were taught better than the kids
IAmA,not_removed,if kids arent learning to read at a grade level then the education system is definitely failing they might not be at fault but theyre still failing at their goal lets say its as simple as you suggest and parents are to blame that means that educators were dependant on parental imput that isnt happening anymore they can bitch about parents not reading to their kids all day but it wont change in time for the kids currently in school so this guy wants to try something new and thinks it will help whats the big deal
IAmA,not_removed,the education system stopped using whole word exclusively ages ago it was only in california at that
IAmA,not_removed,seriously this seems like a faulty premise to me yeah definitely feels like someone pulling numbers out their ass
IAmA,not_removed,damn blind kids and their blind privilege
IAmA,not_removed,first years try you build your vocabulary by that i meant memorizing how each character is written from elementary school throughout the end of junior high new charactersidioms are still being introduced in senior high school its just that character memorization isnt the focus anymore i dont think for a second that our chinese retention is reduced after years in fact you pick up the majority of the characters that would be used in life after grade in elementary school and we dont exactly slow down in learning at all that was a huge alarm for me also the percentages without numbers
IAmA,not_removed,still breaks the arbitrary cap op created
IAmA,not_removed,ive got two kids and the sight words seem to be those that dont sound like they are spelled i even joke with my kids how in english every word has its own rules to pronounce it
IAmA,not_removed,i am a literacy teacher in england there are many words that cannot be taught phonetically but there are other strategies to try with sight words such as looking for for particular spelling patterns words within words using mnemonics its all about finding what works what works for one child does not work for them all i also have a year old so can see from the perspective of a parent too the best advice i can give is practise practise practice but make it fun and varied good luck
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldve thought most of the sounding out words happened in prek k and grade
IAmA,not_removed,this sounds more like spelling words when my son was in kindergarten he had a short list of words he was memorizing mostly words that did not follow the rules of the sounds of the english alphabet but he was also taught how to read using different methods sounding out using the pictures on the page for context rhyming words adding ing etc hes now in grade and they dont get any words sent home to learn to read he will be getting words sent home to spell thats different from learning how to read
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair by third grade shouldnt she have the basic concept of readingsounding out new words down anyway i remember we started having spelling tests around grade your sight words list doesnt sound much different than the list our teachers would give us to study for the spelling test
IAmA,not_removed,sight words are usually only the very common words or relatively common words that people find tricky for example words like the i and and but should absolutely be recognized on sight
IAmA,not_removed,sight words are taught just about everywhere but these are common short words almost always taught as supplementary to phonemes by third grade though teachers might be assuming that their students are largely familiar with english phonemes a good teacher though should recognize when a student isnt and work on it
IAmA,not_removed,teacher here i cant speak for the teachers at your daughters school but as far as instruction goes there is a larger focus on phonics in the earlier grades and less so in and beyond phonics and phonemic awareness is essential in those early years in order for students to decode unknown words however there are just some words that are harder to sound out and are just easier to memorize ex words like be and you and drive s ounding out the word drive may throw a kid off since we typically pronounce the word jrive and dont really put much emphasis on the d sound it may not be that your childs teachers are neglecting teaching phonics in fact they probably have whole chunks of the day dedicated to just teachingreteaching phonics skills it may be the opposite where the sight word list is focused on so little inside the classroom that the only way to get any good practice in is by sending it home with student ive never taught in a school nor heard of one in the midwest at least that still focuses on whole word reading that style of teaching is outdated and at our schools anyway hasnt been used for years i hope this helps you
IAmA,not_removed,my son just started the grade this is what theyre doing here as well not once has he gotten anything remotely close to teaching him the sounds of letters or really even any of the basic little rules for english its been nothing but these are wordsmemorize them
IAmA,not_removed,if shes learning how to spell it its not a sight word anymore because she is learning the letters that create it and not treating the word as a whole
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for sharing to be fair many schools do attempt to teach phonics in the first years of education sadly the default system is the process of memorizing words i am very happy that you are taking the extra time with your child to teach her the sounds of the letters
IAmA,not_removed,sight words are not meant to be taught phonetically but by memorization these are very common words that may or may not sound like they appear but having then burned into their brains will greatly increase their reading efficiency
IAmA,not_removed,i agree with the first person though because i was taught how he and his kids were taught you sound out the word and a lot of words ive never heard before i could spell because of the way its heard obviously there are some exceptions but generally most words can be spelt by just hearing
IAmA,not_removed,i am a teacher who does education research make no mistake this entire post is essentially bullshit this venture is about the guys profits not what is best for kids this ama is a commercial for his product but who cares what i say anyways obviously this guy is an eye surgeon who made an education app and therefore knows best about literacy education
IAmA,not_removed,i was educated in nj in the and i dont ever recall sight reading it was always sound the word out and even then you can learn to mispronounce things but early on reading out loud helps correct issues there ive never heard of this sight reading concept to be honest
IAmA,not_removed,hey dr colvard judging by the other comments it seems like the majority of users here didnt learn sight reading as a child is this a recent trend for school districts in the us from this comment i get the impression its a result of the metricsfocused education that has resulted from policies like no child left behind
IAmA,not_removed,i applaud your attempt to help children read but i find the reasoning disingenuous i went to early elementary school in lausd in the late wilbur avenue elementary in tarzana for i would be surprised to learn that they actually changed how they teach reading i believe they simply havent we learned to sound out words like ccccat i am currently a secondary school teacher who has encountered the massive reduction in reading skills most of my juniors last year read at a grade reading level however i believe this literacy epidemic is due to a number of factors like increased class size high turnaround in elementary teaching a focus on engagement instead of rigor in schools and changes in parenting i do not believe that phonemic awareness has actually fallen to the wayside in instructional practices but that hard subjects that make kids sad piss parents off in the short term and lead to teachers focusing less on the essentials in favor of more engaging instructional practices which often are far less rigorous and less dependent on reading skills
IAmA,not_removed,linguist here rote memorization is used early on teaching a language as it is the fastest way to establish a foundation of often used words theoretically it should be used to develop a working vocabulary so that the more arcane skills can be communicated unfortunately this transition is never made for several reasons there are two main reasons which tie into your sociopolitical framing the first would be the child not attaining a sufficient reading level before the school system attempts to pivot in reading techniques if the student falls into remedial reading classes then they will lag behind for years in the best case scenario the other reason could just be because the teachers lack the skills to teach children how to self learn i wont expand on this because im not an educator and im not privy to the economicstraining of american public school teachers perhaps one of the teachers reading this could offer their experiences from one of their workshops
IAmA,not_removed,my son goes to a fairly highly ranked school in middle america and his school teaches a combination they have a sight word list to which a couple words are added each week but the bulk of reading is taught by sounding it out with a regular spelling list the sight words are fairly basic common words which the kids should already have a decent grasp of and theyre now being taught to see it as a whole which is how proficient readers see words students here are ranked high in reading proficiency and this seems to me to be a good method of teaching
IAmA,not_removed,you sound like a spokesman
IAmA,not_removed,how can that be if i learn to read cat by saying cccc aaa tttt cat then i later learn to read hat i can reference that the at in cat in the same as the at in hat and get to the correct result quicker maybe im a bad person to think about this because reading came extremely easy for me and i was the one who was frustrated by the dumb kids trying to sound out simple words i definitely remember learning what i think we called phonics ch makes this sound ck makes that sound tion makes this sound la makes that sound vowels change the sound of other vowels like vs lick put that shit together and youve got a word i cant explain any of this anymore because i learned to read in like preschool thru grade or so but i swear we werent just shown flash cards with words we learned the phonics this was also the era of hooked on phonics worked for me so did we take a giant step backwards in teaching reading in the years between when i grew up and today
IAmA,not_removed,my mom tutored kids in la for a few years and was a reading specialist in the midwest for decades before that the kids she tutored in la werent taught phonics in school she had to teach them to read herself in the schools she worked at in the midwest all used some form of phonics program
IAmA,not_removed,that may or may not be due to the school i read a fucking shit ton as a kid i mean piles and piles of books all the time i was only allowed an hour of tv a day and didnt have many friends so i just read i also did well in school my spelling is still complete shit as an adult it wasnt for lack of the schools trying to get me to spell well it wasnt because i wasnt reading enough spelling is just not something i do well
IAmA,not_removed,how does the word if not follow english phonics rules
IAmA,not_removed,just because someone makes it to college doesnt mean they can read adequately
IAmA,not_removed,many incoming college freshman are sent back to a remedial english class although thats usually due to issues with their writing not their reading
IAmA,not_removed,two thirds of those entering community college have to take remedial courses in english andor math it would not surprise me that more than half of students arent doing well at the fourth grade level given that so many need remediation by the time they reach college
IAmA,not_removed,percent sounds really high to me too in grade my kids took a test and we were told they read on an grade level i dont believe it they are smart but they would be lost at an grade level i just dont know how they are calculating these numbers
IAmA,not_removed,english prof here in my experience teaching first year english at both community college and private universities this number is unfortunately accurate my private school students struggle with reading newspaper articles and of my cc students had to take a remedial english course before coming to my class
IAmA,not_removed,chinese here there are about chinese logograms in total but you only need about of those for everyday life so whole word method got you covered also deciphering the parts of a logogram only works if the logogram was built from two simpler ones in those cases you can easily guess its meaning based of the two simpler ones but there is no rule that dictates how the built up logogram sounds you just have to guess edit looks like my origianl numbers were wrong and someone roughly explained before me
IAmA,not_removed,he has since responded and yeah you guessed it hes using the naep yeah i dont like this ama at all none of it matches what i understand about the state of education in the us unless hes talking about how things were in the
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for this i am a school psychologist as well and cannot for the life of me figure how he got an ama there are so many better well researched programs out there he clearly has some financial backer that has pull with reddit we should do an ama
IAmA,not_removed,i totally understand it is scientists researchers and educational theorists that often help progress our profession you dont have to be down in the trenches to know about pedagogy and those of us in the trenches rely on other professions to guide our methods i do however worry this post is pandering to the fear and uncertainty most parents feel when approaching how best to educate their children all in the name of promoting an app to say whole word instruction is the most common form of reading instruction simply isnt true
IAmA,not_removed,i presume you mean the national assessment of educational progress for readingthat assessment doesnt measure whether or not a student is reading at grade level proficient in that test means they are reading significantly above grade level
IAmA,not_removed,tone down the praise it only makes you seem like more of a salesman
IAmA,not_removed,we watched spanish shows with english subtitles all the time in spanish classes and it never seemed to help much for me
IAmA,not_removed,my little brother posted that
IAmA,not_removed,the omission of the word forgot is deliberate and the point of the joke the error in the title is i teamed up a producer needs to be with a producer
IAmA,not_removed,accidentally a word is a tongue in cheek internet phrase for when you miss a word
IAmA,not_removed,httpknowyourmemecommemesiaccidentally
IAmA,not_removed,so to rephrase for others a bar is set nationally not based on statistics average but on desired level of reading proficiency to look better some states have lowered their goal bar to show that the average is at the bar or higher
IAmA,not_removed,the comparisons are actually both a normative and standards driven when we look at the nations report card naep we see that many students are not reaching the standards put in place in addition we see students when compared with each other are underperforming in poorer school districts with the implementation of common core standards were comparing students to standards rather than each other unfortunately this method of teaching is not implemented well and many students fall below proficiency
IAmA,not_removed,as a year ed student i can tell you that the methods have never been better than now they were either worse or the same whats gotten more effective are the tracking accountability and access to education before many students teachers and schools that didnt have high grades could be ignored or swept under the rug now that is much more difficult schools are being held to higher testing standards since nclb high stakes testing is pretty bad but thats what weve had for over years now more ell english language learners students are going to school and getting support that they need but they arent throwing off the demographics so much that they lower reading levels the single biggest issue is simply that parents dont read as much to their kids as they used to often due to work and time restraints or their own bad feelings towards books and kids dont read to themselves usually because they play prefer to play video games or watch tv instead parents who hate reading pass that onto their kids and they severely handicap their learning how can students get better if they never practice why would they practice if their role models despise reading
IAmA,not_removed,overweight has a more objective standard that can be followed there are clinical studies that can link a certain bmi threshold to increased likelihoods of various health problems the same cant really be said for reading levels a fourthgrade level is the level at which a typical fourthgrader reads is it not
IAmA,not_removed,thanks that is different from the evidence i had read i will have to look a little more i had heard the benefit of working memory games is overstated httpwwwscientificamericancomarticlebraintrainingdoesntmakeyousmarter
IAmA,not_removed,its just amazing to me how people are jumping all over this its so obvious op is just selling a product and people are just eating it up smh
IAmA,not_removed,no worries im with you man
IAmA,not_removed,youre absolutely correct also i think that age appropriate gets tossed around too much if the text is too difficult the kid can get disengaged but if a child is reading ahead of their grade level anyway then let them read the inappropriate text i read gone with the wind in grade because it was the longest book on my parents bookshelf totally inappropriate for a year old some might argue but it was interesting to me and at pages long it helped propel my class into winning the read around the world contest they were holding as our combined class read pages before anyone else
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,ctrlf rabbit same
IAmA,not_removed,yes that is the one professor pups phoneme farms
IAmA,not_removed,i guess i was just more wondering how these grade levels are set if theyre not based on average proficiency
IAmA,not_removed,i think this is replacing the traditional teaching method not supplementing it so one would think that the invested time would be similar
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for asking for clarification overall of children were in the lower percentile upon entering the class after the completion of lessons only were left in the bottom percentile while were in the upper percentile additionally of readers entered the class at or above the percentile upon completion of the lessons that number grew to
IAmA,not_removed,this is a very valid point the data we used is data taken from schools that did beta testing from our program we did not have a control but we used a reading metric which compared the children to an agematched cohort we would love to publish our data in the future as the app grows and have discussed doing so with local universities
IAmA,not_removed,i agree bottom to top could be a move of one point it was far from illuminating
IAmA,not_removed,currently these are all los angeles based schools however we are attempting to move forward on a national level
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your comment skepticism is healthy overall of children were in the lower percentile upon entering the class after the completion of lessons only were left in the bottom percentile while were in the upper percentile additionally of readers entered the class at or above the percentile upon completion of the lessons that number grew to
IAmA,not_removed,i learned by phonics i had no idea that whole word was even an option until i baby sat some kids and said sound it out they looked at me like i had two heads they also were required to learn words on flashcards like they had to do somewhere around everyday it was insanity it took forever all they needed was to know what sounds letters make and the blends that is what we called sounds like sh th ch tr br etc
IAmA,not_removed,i agree with the comment you made about gamifying it not based on monetary gains though im a grade teacher and i have students who still read at a grade level so i am very aware of the importance of any helpful methods however gamifying everything has turned my profession into one full of people having to entertain rather than teach everything is about it being a game or playful or entertaining and i mean it like that with all the exclamation points
IAmA,not_removed,the game is free if it were just about cash he would probably charge in todays world the best way to do your campaigning is to make a relevant product that impresses this is not just about phonics by the way it is about phoneme awareness in practice it is different you should look at the game
IAmA,not_removed,i can attest to this used hooked on phonics during ages i was reading at a grade level by grade
IAmA,not_removed,ditto or windows app as well
IAmA,not_removed,totally interested in this for my suspected dyslexic youngest son bright creative intuitive holds down deeply complex conversations with the smartest of adults mom and i know but just struggles with spelling and reads slower than he should i love the kid but not enough to buy apple products
IAmA,not_removed,its not an app but this book teaches reading with the same method that he seems to be describing my kindergartener loves it
IAmA,not_removed,that is a fantastic idea i will speak to our it team
IAmA,not_removed,i bought a chromebook years ago i use it for google while im doing work on my main computer and they are awesome for online streaming its probably the best ive spent on hardware i also noticed they use them on tv and movies probably because they look nice and are cheap
IAmA,not_removed,cant understate this especially for upupsquest as chromebooks now account for over of all devices sold in education
IAmA,not_removed,would have to switch to c
IAmA,not_removed,grammar naziing is always relevant on reading threads
IAmA,not_removed,i know youre joking but lowerincome families usually have android devices because theyre less expensive and their kids also experience the most screen time on average these are exactly the kind of children who need stuff like this and yet most of the fancy educational apps that they could benefit from are on apple devices instead ios and its limited devices are easier for developers to work with and its also more profitable since people who own apple products are more likely to spend money on apps as well so theres a huge need here for philanthropists and other dogooders to start cranking out quality learning games for kids on the android platform for the love of all that is holy please please offer better alternatives to all the vampire elsa twin pregnancy apps in the google play store this team could have set a good example by developing for android first and im disappointed that they chose to go the apple route im trying to get into this field but i am still a lowly it student my daughter is going to outgrow whatever game im working on by the time i finish it
IAmA,not_removed,baked apple anyone because iphone users just got roasted ps i will wait for the app to be on android as an english nonnative speaker i should enjoy the app while im not at home or working
IAmA,not_removed,or any electronic devices years ago we moved to a low income area out of the main metro area and my son went from an average kid to rich because he not only had a cell phone but i let him use our tablet that had data and we had internet at home his friends would come over to do assignments because they didnt have internet they barely had computers in their homes that same high school now requires all students to use chromebooks so when i grilled a teacher about the kids without internet he said he tells them to go to mcdonalds or the library and use theirs giving webbased education to poor kids just sets them up to fail
IAmA,not_removed,wealth is also a big cause of reading issues in the earliest grades the naep data reveal proficiency gaps in this case between students from moderate and highincome homes and those from lowincome homes as measured by eligibility for free and reducedprice lunch according to an annie e casey foundation analysis of naep data a full percent of lowincome fourthgraders scored below the proficient reading level compared to percent of those from wealthier families kids count data center and as the foundation reported elsewhere the lowincome children who struggle with reading are disproportionately children of color feister
IAmA,not_removed,obviously the expensive ones first
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget that hes talking about phonemes meaning they have to learn all the different sounds e can make not just the symbol e
IAmA,not_removed,the doctor is promoting using phonemes over simply memorizing whole words there are far far more individual words which is where the limit is coming from
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure if its super well understood but its kind of like this you can recognize and recite any individual letter and you can probably also recite the alphabet in order maybe even backwards likely to the tune of the abcs song but that is one chunk of information you probably cant without thinking about it recite the alphabet backwards from the character in fact you probably dont know the character without thinking about it the order of the alphabet is encoded as one chunk and is comprised of smaller fundamental pieces but other orders would require additional learning to memorize a new chunk another thing i always think of with is song lyrics i write songs and often i will forget an entire verse and cant remember it until i remember the first little bit my suspicion is that i have stored the song as a full chunk and havent actually memorized the individual lines separately third example is phone numbers the number thrown around for how many digits people can remember in short term is so generally but by putting numbers in groups you can remember more this is why if youre north american you probably remember phone numbers in three distinct chunks area code first last similarly you can probably easily remember a credit card numbers even though characters is way beyond characters because you divide it into chunks of
IAmA,not_removed,thats true i got the same vibe from this just a way to sell product
IAmA,not_removed,i work as an exceptional childrens teacher for children with mild to moderate disabilities i specialize in reading i have spent hundreds of hours in trainings and have been in many school systems i have never been in a single system or training where the whole word system was currently being used years ago this was the case on a large scale i think you will find that today schools who exclusively use whole word training is a vast minority for example i personally as many teachers and specialist do begin teaching children by using the easiest phonemes and working up to harder blends bl sl etc vowel teams ea oa etc digraphs th sh etc trigraphs tch etc as children age we move on to how syllables effect words especially vowel sounds and doubled consonants however the english language is a complicated language at best and many common words to not follow phonetic rules because of this some words must be taught as whole words commonly referred to as sight words tricky words or dolch words these are words like the was one etc they are imperative to reading fluently but cannot be sounded out in other words not all whole word instruction is bad i think i naively thought this ama would be about these topics not about a singular app one size does not fit all in reading its scary to me to think that parents may read this and think this will solve all their problems edit i typed this on my phone i made a lot of mistakes
IAmA,not_removed,i was probably when i started reading to my kids
IAmA,not_removed,as soon as they can sit still in your lap months old
IAmA,not_removed,im not an expert but i dont think you can start too early
IAmA,not_removed,any age we read to our kids from birth as they get older they can read more on their own but remember that their oral comprehension level will be higher than their reading comprehension level for a long time so my grader can read to himself but we continue to read higher level books to him so he is still exposed to more advanced vocabulary and sentence structures than he can currently read
IAmA,not_removed,all ages
IAmA,not_removed,even newborns will frequently enjoy bright pictures and books with sounds people are extremely nearsighted at birth so pictures close up will be much more interesting than things futher away large sculpture and brightly colored abstract art will also get an infants interest
IAmA,not_removed,all of the ages
IAmA,not_removed,edited post because people are too damn sensitive and i hate getting pms from idiots its good to read to your children at any age i started reading dune aloud to my kid before she was born dont be a lazy asshole of a parent i originally posted something about how my kid has developed very quickly and has had a lot of good parenting theres a correlative relationship between good parenting and proper childhood development obviously if your kid didnt win the genetic lottery like mine did and theres something wrong with little timmy good parenting only goes so far
IAmA,not_removed,you should wait till youre well into your late jk you read to them at all ages constantly
IAmA,not_removed,day im now and my parents read to me for as long as they needed to i then learnt how to read myself and read to them up until about age after which i fell in love for reading and have read ever since reading moby dick right now
IAmA,not_removed,when you find out that youre having a kid
IAmA,not_removed,i dont get your point its still an issue and still ends up with uneducated kids
IAmA,not_removed,it might be more beneficial in the long run to teach them the words have different root languages so they have different rules saying all the rules are random just kind of makes it seem like memorization is the only way which it really isnt edit nevermind everyone the different roots dont matter and all the patterns are false because there are exceptions ye olde reddit circlejerk has convinced me the error of my ways please continue telling your kids that english makes no sense im sure that will have no negative impact or discourage them from trying hard to understand it
IAmA,not_removed,actually i would argue knowing the spelling patterns words within words etc is effectively learning the english language phonetically its just rather than knowing one letter to one sound we learn these patterns establish these sounds
IAmA,not_removed,they went over the sounds the each letter makes but nothing prepares a child for scissors and cough telling her to sound it out doesnt work for so many words in her homework so then she just starts guessing and i start losing more hair
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i cant imagine them still doing sight words in grade
IAmA,not_removed,it can be but current curriculum in the us assumes no reading is done prek prek requirements simply dont exist that some is done in k but not a requirement to move up and only in first grade do students need to have basic whole word comprehension and they are all very short words that students could potentially memorize if thats the strategy they take vs phonemes
IAmA,not_removed,yes she has to learn how to spell them to be tested on them every monday but a lot of her homework has been using these words in a sentence drawing pictures of what the words are etc more trying to memorize the words a week at time rather than breaking down the language and learning why a word sounds and reads like it does
IAmA,not_removed,yeah but there are always words that never follow rules that she has problems with she has been taught to memorize words each week with the hopes of retaining how they sound and are spelled this has lead to her looking at a word in a book when she reads to me and guess what the word is rather than sounding it out because she thinks she already knows what the word is
IAmA,not_removed,i remember them going over the sounds individual letters make but nothing can prepare you for a city sounding like an s when sounding something out she doesnt understand how it can sound like that i dont really understand either so she gets very frustrated trying to read books to me
IAmA,not_removed,i can confirm this learned to read in the mid sound it out was the teachers mantra im seeing other people say oh we learned to sight read and honestly i had no idea this was an actual thing edit im blown away i just asked my coworker and he says sightreading was how he was taught i had no clue
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure i get what sight reading is
IAmA,not_removed,i was educated in ri in the late early when i was in elementary school i lived in a very small rural town in the state they taught creative readingwriting the idea was to let kids write and pronounce words how they felt they should be written and pronounced with a focus more on communicating ideas versus using proper spelling and grammar they believed that as a kid got older and learned more words via sight reading they would pick up proper spelling and grammar on their own and start to correct themselves obviously thats garbage and didnt work at all in the grade i moved about minutes away to a different school district the kids there were taught phonics in elementary school it varies greatly not just state to state but district to district
IAmA,not_removed,born in i dont remember my siblings or myself learning sight reading either in school this is the first i have heard of this even my nephew grade learns by sounding out the words seems to be heavily reliant on which region someone grew up in
IAmA,not_removed,i was educated in virginia in the we absolutely learned exclusively via sight reading edit i dont mean that every school in virginia taught the same way for the entire decade but my school did and it was a notoriously huge failure i just mentioned that i lived in va for context because it is generally known as one of the better states for education of course even in my school some veteran teachers flatout refused to give up teaching phonicsbased reading i unfortunately never had any of them they knew what they were doing and it turned out they were right its very likely that other teachers refused to give up their methods even when wholeword reading was being pushed on them
IAmA,not_removed,there also appears to be a major focus on la schools in the responses anybody from the la school districts that can chime in with their experience i know my nieces in new england are not sight reading but theyre only in and grades i believe
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps this is selection bias at work the people who learned sight reading didnt make it this far into the comments
IAmA,not_removed,this is totally anecdotal and not based on anything other than my own impressions and memories and how i read ops intro it sounded like sight reading wasnt necessarily a policy it might be in some places due to no child as you mentioned but i doubt many but was more of a result of teaching methods in my own youth im thinking gr as this is when i first entered an englishonly curriculum i remember a lot of word lists being sent home for spelling tests at the end of the week we were responsible to know how to spell those word and invariably the way to do that is to memorize the spelling you learn that this is the way it is spelled not why this is the way it is spelled that way you end up knowing what word youre looking at by sight as described by op yes the why is hard in english because of all the exceptions but the byproduct is the sight reading that was described
IAmA,not_removed,hear hear i have a book from the about tech in the classroom it was really amazing to read the same kind of jargon and claims about tossing off the old ways and engaging young people of today with interactive innovative tech they were talking about filmstrips slideshows overhead projectors and records as the future of the classroom the claims about the tired old ways and promise of the new ways were almost identical
IAmA,not_removed,you should come hang out in rparenting where the main problem is apparently an epidemic of boredom the kids are so very bright that they can neither behave nor focus on their excessively boring tasks if only the teacher would challenge them so they could learn
IAmA,not_removed,im in my and i have two kids in one of the top nyc elementary schools i went to a different school but once i got into middle and high school i was in the same classes as kids who went to this school now im starting to remember things i forgot but one of the things i remembered is how most of these kids would have cliff notes for any books we read and me being from a poor family and naive at the time listened to the teachers not to buy the cliff notes so these kids knew all the bullet points the teachers were supposed to teach and got better grades and if you want your kids to read better make sure they read i just bought three books as a birthday gift for a kid who loves to read and is reading above his grade level
IAmA,not_removed,i am currently a secondary school teacher who has encountered the massive reduction in reading skills most of my juniors last year read at a grade reading level to quote a student teachers letter to the editor of the minneapolis star tribute cited in john taylor gattos weapons of mass instruction years earlier fifth graders in minneapolis were reading william shakespeare henry thoreau george washington sir walter scott mark twain benjamin franklin oliver wendell holmes john bunyan daniel webster samuel johnson lewis carroll thomas jefferson emerson and others like them in the appleton school reader but today i was told children are not to be expected to spell the following words correctly back big call came can day did dog down get good have he home if in is it like little man morning mother my night off out over people play ran said saw she some soon their them there time two too up us very water we went where when will would etc is this nuts
IAmA,not_removed,the teachers lack the skills to teach children how to self learn or it could just apparently not be part of the proper curriculum instead who knows i wish my school taught how to self learn because i never figured out how to do it and now i dont want to do it because of how awful school was for me
IAmA,not_removed,theyre not mutually exclusive when you sound it out and you can reference known symbols to build new words but after doing all of that you saw the word hat as a new shape with a new sound creating a new word phonics and phonemic awareness are very different teaching mechanisms even though they may sound similar for instance using pa you probably wouldnt do the flashcard activity youre talking about as it further reinforces the shapes sounds words dynamic that leads to issues in the same way that the whole word method does phonemics deals with the smallest possible units of sound within a language within english there are phonemes phonemics is more focused on the ability to use and distinguish those units from one another through repeated listening and speaking than the ability to use and distinguish individual words or sounds through recognizing symbols and reading
IAmA,not_removed,im probably about years older than you i was placed in a second language immersion french program when i started school we were taught to read and write in french a p e trudeau experiment on children a few years ago i learned that i was never actually taught to read english about of the class was spontaneously able to read in their first language english
IAmA,not_removed,so did we take a giant step backwards in teaching reading in the years between when i grew up and today we just have way more peasants in the us today than we did when you were growing up
IAmA,not_removed,good point thanks for mentioning that we each have our strengths and weaknesses
IAmA,not_removed,i graduated hs with at least football players that couldnt read past a grade level and one that probably coudnt hit a grade level last i knew only the grade level guy didnt go to college
IAmA,not_removed,unless things have changed drastically from the mid when i worked in my colleges writing center most of the people who were put in remedial english before english comp were put there because of their writing skills mainly not knowing how to write a persuasive essay most would write like a chronological list of facts theyd rehash the plot of a book with zero analysis or theyd give you the history of euthanasia with no opinion but then again i didnt go to a community college maybe the kids who flat out cant read are all going the community route
IAmA,not_removed,true but what about those that are multilingual i have cousins that have one japanese and one chinese parent which are actively teaching them both languages both written and verbal lives in arizona so they are picking up quite a bit of spanish and by default knows english i think they broke the cap by now
IAmA,not_removed,i guess it was just the sheer amount of time theyd spent watching it an hour a week is different from every evening when i was living in france french tv defo helped me but i was probably watching a lot more than you my polish friend said he learned english from gaming their tv is dubbed but i dont think his accent is as good because he didnt hear the sounds as much
IAmA,not_removed,in spanish classes no nnnnnnn no thats not it its the emotional impact the popculture bit the growingup on it let me gather my thoughts imagine your favorite tv shows imagine all of them are from finland always have been nothing your own industry produces is watchable also all good games come from finland and the coolest western country is finland all western countries agree the most popular music is finnish all your tv stations have finnish movies and series in of their programming slots for decades kids tv is mostly from finland all the blockbuster stuff a high percentage of porn even cooking shows and all those imported series and movies come with subtitles in your language you basically grow up on finnish pop cultures youre favorite shirt says dont you think your finnish is more than okish by now
IAmA,not_removed,also matt damon is not the producer of the simpsons matt groening is his little brother forgot that too
IAmA,not_removed,sometimes you even accidentally the whole thing
IAmA,not_removed,perfectly cromulent meme
IAmA,not_removed,thanks i dont spend much time learning memes these days usually i am pushing hours debugging code so i miss some of the finer memes in life
IAmA,not_removed,this is correct which obviously means the end result is the bar getting so low people end up illiterate
IAmA,not_removed,as a failed teacher i can tell you the things they teach you in ed school are full of lies and pseudoscience and have very little connection to the real world your overall analysis sounds good but id be skeptical of what the educational research says about current techniques wait a month and a new fad will come along claiming the stuff youre saying is the best yet is terrible and theres some other magic bullet thatll bring test scores up
IAmA,not_removed,ha i feel sorry for you here you are asking a good and valid question over and over in what seems like a clear manner to me and yet people keep giving you the same response one that isnt quite answering what you are asking i think your bmi example is helpful thats objective or close to it but how can we objectively determine the reading level where a child should be certainly we have a literacy issue in this country people choose to read less complex texts state of the union addresses have steadily declined in complexity interesting infographic on that somewhere so yes many students are behind in some measurable sense but to draw a solid line of where they should be is at least slightly arbitrary i teach reading comprehension to graders i often wonder how much of their habits as readers or nonreaders are set by the time they reach me how much can i realistically hope to grow them in that sense even arbitrary standards can be helpful helpful in a limited way i can use the data to assess my teaching and improve it along with many other assessments of progess its when standards become a totalizing force in education that problems arise
IAmA,not_removed,games dont increase general intelligence but they do increase proficiency at the specific task the game is about a language game really should improve your language
IAmA,not_removed,well he said keep the mind fresh not that it makes your intelligence go up that basically means what you know stays fresh in your mind or you stay in practice its like a sport if you dont play for a while your skills get a little rusty
IAmA,not_removed,one of the biggest things for me was reading as a class reading as a class would make any reader hate reading for starters you have to read in front of everyone if you are bad at reading people are going to make fun of you for fucking up and youll never want to read out loud or probably at all if youre a good reader you could be done in two minutes what takes the class an hour to get through because of the slower readers and typical distractions if youre just shy you probably just wanna piss your pants no matter how good or bad a reader you are the poor kids have the system rigged against them and the people that are supposed to guide them buy into shit like this and we wonder why there is still a problem
IAmA,not_removed,sorry for my incorrect syntax and punctuation on that one was holding my month old and trying to type former english major here my year old is getting into reading and would love this thanks for clarification
IAmA,not_removed,i doubt this education is too high stakes these days to go all in on a new and mostly untest pedagogical strategy i am guessing they are using it during related arts or computer literacy time not that increased time on literacy is bad but just it might make up a large chunk of their gains
IAmA,not_removed,this is just gobbledygook what youre saying is that the kids that didnt use your methods actually moved down
IAmA,not_removed,thanks much more impressive to see the real numbers
IAmA,not_removed,there are a few controls i would be really interested in seeing phoneme farm of course textheavy popular games pokemon undertale classic dosnessnesgameboy games like chrono trigger and final fantasy essentially any game made at a time or with a technology that made developers use text rather than voice actors vocalheavy popular games modern games like halo or portal where voice actors are used instead of text games where theres less text like racing games could also fit into this category no video games poor kids its for science aperture science which you wont know about the point would be not only to see if phoneme farm is effective but if its more or less effective than textbased games that dont have a necessarily educational aim since noneducational textual games expect you to understand the words and phrases to express tasks and goals it would feel less like a chore it would also force kids to use contextual thinking when they come across a word or phrase they dont understand they know they want to evolve charmander they want to know how to save marles ancestor from the monsters in the chappel in the woods they want to be able to read sans terrible puns they will work hard at it and never realise that they are learning at all in my experience with educational games they are often too in your face to be truly effective i remember as a kid having two educational games httpwwwcdaccesscomgifssharedfrontlargegreatmagif and one made by jumpstart that has apparently been buried by thousands of new editions they all had the same problem they werent sneaky enough about what they were doing most of the time it simply felt like rainbow paint on the work i was already doing in class i just felt like i needed a calculator instead of solving puzzles that would drive me to the mindset and skill set to do the work funny enough building things in a primitive program made me do more math in my head quickly than any educational software did so phoneme farm would need to do better than pokemon or chrono trigger not only at raw education but at holding attention as well an educational game is at its heart a game first if kids dont want to play it they wont and wont absorb anything if forced all participants would have to have their eyes examined and corrective glasses issued possibly every months just to insure that variable is accounted for a kid that cant see cant read when my sister was learning to read i got really tired of trying to help her read a boring book with tiny words so i did what any lazy brother would do i popped banjokazooie into my and had her read all the text boxes at first she would ask what a word was at first i would tell her but after a few weeks i would ask her to try to pronounce the word and guess the meaning correcting her if she was wrong eventually she stopped asking and that christmas she got a game boy now well shes in college and writes in rwritingprompts so i would say she can read pretty well theres one technical nag that really concerns me the fact its only been released on ios i know a lot of families that ether cant afford an ipad or wouldnt trust their child with an expensive tablet android tablets come in many pricepoints and kidfriendly designs and should be powerful enough to run phoneme farm is designed for kids with thick rubber and preloaded with kids apps and made by a reputable company amazon by keeping your app on ios only you are inadvertently preventing kids from the poorer segments of the population from being able to use your app you stated that thats the last thing you want so please consider an android release someday
IAmA,not_removed,controls or gtfo
IAmA,not_removed,those numbers sound absurdly high i would love to see the data
IAmA,not_removed,my wife is a reading specialist and curriculum consultant in the midwest if youre interested im sure shed love to hear about what youre doingfinding any interest in trying something in mn
IAmA,not_removed,percentile of what were they being compared to the same standard as when they started or were they being compared to a standard that also went up as the control children got older
IAmA,not_removed,i did not realize the game was free i stand humbly corrected probably should have bothered to check on that first phonemes are part of phonics teaching methods if you dont think they are then you dont really understand phonics teaching methods or the distinction between the two in practice phonemes are a segment of phonics teaching methods phonemes are auditory phonics are visual phonemes are distinguishing sounds within words phonics are distinguishing and understanding how to represent those sounds in text you cant have a complete understanding of reading without both focusing on one without the other is just silly
IAmA,not_removed,that ditto better have at least perfect iv stats
IAmA,not_removed,strange that the app was released on the most expensive device that probably would not hit the major target market seems fishy scoob
IAmA,not_removed,if your goal is to impact as many children as possible make it platform agnostic convert it to the web and then any developer can make a wrapper app for any device from phones and tablets to computers it will also cost far less than creating apps for each platform
IAmA,not_removed,what is the current broad eta for completion is this a weeks thing months thing or years thing
IAmA,not_removed,nah all product placement is intentional they are getting paid to include them not that thats a bad thing
IAmA,not_removed,which one do you recommend
IAmA,not_removed,the c sharps
IAmA,not_removed,wait for the app ha whos the baked apple now oh its still me dang
IAmA,not_removed,i always hated stuff like this when i was a kid and the internet was still uncommon in the average home we started getting assignments like this i grew up in a rural area and lots of low income homes so it was unlikely many students would finish the work after a few assignments like this the teacher asked why no one did the work i answered that i didnt have a computer at home and was told that i shouldve went to the library well my mother never learned to drive and my father worked all day theres no public transport in my hometown so i had no idea how he expected me to do it
IAmA,not_removed,or books my parents taught for decades in inner city elementary schools and many of their students came from households which contained no books these kids often start school without being able to spell their own names if youre trying to start teaching kids to read at the beginning of kindergarten theyre already years behind
IAmA,not_removed,wealth isnt a causative factor educated people teaching their kids to read is correlation not causation
IAmA,not_removed,good point still a little confused about the relative numbers also worth pointing out in this discussion is the fact that people even kids take a lot longer to learn chinese and its at least partially because theres no sounding out option you just have to memorize or look up every word you want to use at least from my experience context can help if you know the vast majority of characters in a given piece of writing but only if you already know the word in spoken language
IAmA,not_removed,right i was taking the chinese character thing to its logical conclusionmaking a comparison back to english and suggesting that there may be some automaticintuitive recognition of individual letter sounds andor phonemes within the context of whole word memorization but not trying to paint myself as the authority here
IAmA,not_removed,welcome to riama
IAmA,not_removed,shit im and i dont even have kids should i should i read to other peoples children instead
IAmA,not_removed,ah the
IAmA,not_removed,even better get them used to it while youre still cradling them in your arm theres no reason not to start on day one the actual learning benefit is negligible but the habit and routine forming helps that whole sittingstill part later on
IAmA,not_removed,word been reading to mine since mos one of his first words was book
IAmA,not_removed,thats when he stopped sitting still in my lap all he wants to do is crawl and walk i try reading to him anyway but hes never interested
IAmA,not_removed,agreed been reading bedtimes stories to my daughter since the day we brought her home almost years ago
IAmA,not_removed,we read aloud to ours when they were still in the womb
IAmA,not_removed,i remember reading lotr to my daughter while she was still in the womb she would respond to the sound of my voice it was pretty awesome
IAmA,not_removed,this child could be the kwisatz haderach we have waited so long for hopefully she wont do anything foolish like fall in lovethat could be bad
IAmA,not_removed,my son took a long time to develop speech but his comprehension seemed pretty good i am certain that the first phrase he could understand and respond to was turn the next page which he would do the best he could with his clumsy baby fingers
IAmA,not_removed,the parents are probably uneducated is what im saying we cant solely assume the the parents are able themselves to teach the kids just because they have a family now i just wish that life didnt get in the way so that parents and children can both learn
IAmA,not_removed,exemplified
IAmA,not_removed,expected
IAmA,not_removed,thou tough trough though through thorough the root of each of these words and why they all have different vowel sounds
IAmA,not_removed,saying all the rules are random just kind of makes it seem like memorization is the only way which it really isnt except it is random particularly in which language something derives from either way it comes down to memorization youre either working with memorizing the word itself or where the word derives from
IAmA,not_removed,this is true but even with the phonemes there are over different graphemes and teaching spelling patterns within groups of words enables some pupils to move forwards and these are just phonetically correct words this also help with sight words i would consider nonphonetic words too for example should could would although a nice little mnemonic could be used here
IAmA,not_removed,oughmakes the ow sound tion shun
IAmA,not_removed,that sounds more like vocabulary like the definition of a word thats different from being able to read it
IAmA,not_removed,here is the reason for this homework is a bunch of bullshit i give my students vocabulary words and work to do at home to ensure that they are reading and doing some learning activities at home the majority of the word work or working on the words sounds small group learning focusing on what each child needs happens in the classroom if you are from a middle class suburban school district i would take a few minutes to discuss your concerns with the teacher and im sure hisher reasoning for the homework you think seems silly will be because kids need to do something at home usually mandated by the districtstate and spelling choice boards are some of the easiest to assign weekly if you are from a lowerincome district then i will pull down to sure also there is something to be said for the differentiation and choice provided in allowing students to practice their skills in various ways
IAmA,not_removed,exactly it was the same for us we went over every single letter how it sounds and for the vowels we would go over different examples of the different ways to pronounce them soft v hard my son tries to spell phonetically but doesnt really understand the way the letters work which causes him to spell things incorrectly just like your example of city sounding like sity he has a really hard time with it and gets very frustrated when trying to do his work its really difficult trying to explain all the different rules and weird little things that come with learning english when theyre doing the exact opposite in school especially when he gets so immediately frustrated
IAmA,not_removed,i thought everyone learned to sound it out
IAmA,not_removed,learned to read in the earlymid as well everything was sound it out i try to teach and impart this on my thirdgrader and he looks at me like im crazy when i tell him to do that in order to figure out words
IAmA,not_removed,clocking in to confirm also learned to read in the mid sounding out was the way we all learned
IAmA,not_removed,there may be some response bias in this post i feel that people with average or subaverage reading skills who got left behind by the system as a child probably dont spend much time on reddit furthermore they might not be very interested in this post i recall being taught wholeword memorization methods in public school while sound it out was what my mom always got me to do privately it helps a lot that my mom was very serious about family reading time several times a week also i became a voracious reader when i discovered scifi and fantasy in my opinion poor reading development strongly correlates with lack of parental involvement at home these are the kids whose parents rarely or never show up at parentteacher meetings the source of my anecdotal evidence so is a public school teacher
IAmA,not_removed,i went to school in the and and we were taught what sounds letters make but overall we were taught to recognize a word by what it looked like i have adhd and my parents picked up hookedonphonics for me and i am of the opinion it did wonders for me
IAmA,not_removed,im not fully sure i do either but it sound like they teach kids to recognize words rather than sound them out personally i feel like i sort of developed a sight reading after learning and reading words a lot but knowing how to sound them out is the step to learning them so for example a kid who learns sight reading wouldnt be able to sound out the word learning but would be able to read it if they had seen it before almost like using drawn out pictograms id say its similar to the kanji japanese uses but kanji have multiple readings making it far more complex and chinese has way more than everyday characters i have to wonder how kids in the us cant overall do sight reading but china and japan can teach far more complex systems without major issue
IAmA,not_removed,instead of doing this word sounds like absihdee the class does this word looks like abcde
IAmA,not_removed,good to know i remember we did our own spelling of words in kindergarten but as a yr old i hated it id ask how a word was spelled and the teacher would tell me to write it however i thought it should be didnt matter that we didnt know how to read and hadnt been taught in school i knew the alphabet at the time but not how words were written so it was pretty bad first grade they taught us reading and spelling though and things were much better
IAmA,not_removed,and that is why programs like common core are born not saying if common core is good or bad just saying it was intended to fix those kinds of problems
IAmA,not_removed,these wacky teaching methods were actually designed to work around the second language many children had to standard english that is ethnic dialects instead of imposing the stress of learning a new way to speak they thought it was desireable not to scare children off with that difficulty it didnt work at all
IAmA,not_removed,also called whole language trendy in the across the us
IAmA,not_removed,also va we learned to sound them out
IAmA,not_removed,va student here sounded out our words which part of the state were you in
IAmA,not_removed,sight reading is that phoneme farm like or whole word school
IAmA,not_removed,since we are sharing roanoke va here and even in the country we learned to sound it out i moved back here from los angeles because the schools are horrendous and i want my son to have a good education are schools teaching children to read this new way here
IAmA,not_removed,i work as a district curriculum and technology specialist in los angeles and know a few of the schools op has worked with to put in this app its commonly called pups quest around here afaik all those schools were not teaching sight reading before they were using reading programs from mcgraw hill open court and houghton mifflin harcourt reading first that taught a balanced approach to literacy phonemic awareness phonics fluency vocabulary and comprehension sight words are still taught in these schools as a support for reading fluency but not as a substitute for phonemic awareness dolch or fry sight words are the most common ones op needs to come up with some legit evidence that sight reading iswas being taught as a substitute for a balanced literacy approach
IAmA,not_removed,i learned to read in the in los angeles i have never heard of sight reading outside of music i can still hear my teachers telling us to sound it out
IAmA,not_removed,i am a product of la unified school district education in the my schools were in a fairly middle class and blue collar neighborhood reading was taught through sounding out the letters there was very little rote or sight reading that i remember
IAmA,not_removed,i was wondering about that reddit has a high volume of people who enjoy spending their time reading at least the bits i like to hang out in maybe sight readers are frustrated by a lifetime built on a poor foundation and dont grow up to spend their time reading i learned phonics in a little cow town in oregon between i spend a lot of time reading technical manuals and scifi there is no way i would be who i am today if i wasnt taught the love of reading
IAmA,not_removed,theyre probably less likely to be on reddit period
IAmA,not_removed,colvard i never learned that word this topic is over my head
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think learning to spell is the same as sight reading we learning phonics sound it out and spelling in tandem
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair though filmstrips slideshows overhead projectors and records now movies powerpoints digital projectors etc actually did change education fairly significantly
IAmA,not_removed,it was really amazing to read the same kind of jargon and claims about tossing off the old ways and engaging young people of today with interactive innovative tech buzzwords is as buzzwords does
IAmA,not_removed,well if youre part of a school system that focuses on broad achievement of minimum standards rather than narrow achievement of individual potential which is a great many of them that seems like a reasonably common and realistic problem to experience
IAmA,not_removed,i would think that parents who are actively seeking advice are probably more likely to have bright children than those who dont look for any parenting resources obviously some of their kids are probably perfectly average and just lazy but to dismiss the boredom issue out of hand seems silly to me when schools are most concerned with everyone passing standardized tests and have to spoonfeed the information to half the kids the other half are bound to be bored out of their minds
IAmA,not_removed,i mean that is a legitimate problem but id wager parents more often than not delude themselves into thinking little timmy is more intelligent than he really is
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think self learning can be taught it can be encouraged but you need to find something that interests you enough that learning more about it doesnt seem like a chore it took me until for this to work for me
IAmA,not_removed,mmm isnt kanji simplified chinese characters also english and spanish have a very similar alphabet with that said that is still languages so i guess it is over cap
IAmA,not_removed,reading specialist here more trigger time on ineffective programs isnt really that useful it doesnt address the underlying problem a cow doesnt get heavier by eating more inert filler i can go into more detail if you want but what is being described seems about right to me
IAmA,not_removed,its a good question to ask and one i wish op would answer since were just a bunch of speculating sallies at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,not to mention that in the title becomes in the intro which is actually if you click through to the link its still bad but this lack of care with numbers is telling
IAmA,not_removed,i think hes testing them as they coming in and describing their ascension percentile wise over time likea before and after thing
IAmA,not_removed,yeah im betting some self selection bias here among which students got selected and how testing was done
IAmA,not_removed,well maybe if most of the children using the app start below but near and end up above but near then that may not be a large improvement a change from to doesnt seem high to me
IAmA,not_removed,reading specialist using a similar approach thats not absurd from my perspective i can take kids one on one that are nonreaders and they can be reading harry potter in a year sounds to me like hes hammering phonics repetition which is exactly what struggling readers need
IAmA,not_removed,you should try and dm him
IAmA,not_removed,not to mention when talking about percentiles at that particular grade level you have to consider normal growth ill eat my hat if they got that kind of growth above expected growth
IAmA,not_removed,the most important question
IAmA,not_removed,what
IAmA,not_removed,i completely agree and that is our plan thanks for the tip
IAmA,not_removed,alternatively he could use httpswwwxamarincom to make it a native app on ios android wp windows and mac os all at once that would be huge since theres a lot more windows pcs in schools than iphones
IAmA,not_removed,yep ever notice how they tape logos on peoples hats and water bottles on tv shows no free advertising for anyone
IAmA,not_removed,maybe this comment was a product placement
IAmA,not_removed,i couldnt even tell you i was just looking for the cheapest steaming machine and i found the one i have i dont even know which model i have but ill check when i get home really though if you just looking for a googlesteaming machine it doesnt have to be that great id just look for the cheapest one then wait for a sale
IAmA,not_removed,yep when the teacher told me he just sends them to the library or mcds i point out that some of their students live in a distant community about miles out of town that barely has a bar and no internet i got it when the expensive prestigious prep school assigned homework on laptops but bfe shouldnt try to be like them then they cry when test scores drop and parents pull kids to send to the charter down the road
IAmA,not_removed,when my kids started school i lived in a very poor area most of the kids were esl students and i remember how happy my sons teacher was to have a child who came in actually knowing his letters numbers and how to write his own name much less read write add subtract i am still shocked that people can spend years with a child and not even pick up a book and read to them what do they do during that time i was a single mom with kids and a job and had plenty of time to spend with them even putting them in front of the tv to watch sesame street is trying
IAmA,not_removed,i think there is for many people which is why some people manage to learn to read well with wholeword methods but it would certainly be more efficient to teach them these breakdowns rather than just showing them a lot of words and expecting them to work it out without any prompting or help and a lot of kids never really get the hang of it without a lot of help
IAmA,not_removed,definitely i would recommend starting with the classics like fight club or lolita
IAmA,not_removed,you need to lock them in your basement first
IAmA,not_removed,hold my book im going in edit dude you cant just drop a switcharoo in there httpswwwredditcomrswitcharoonew
IAmA,not_removed,my mom read to me even before i was born i love reading and i credit it to her
IAmA,not_removed,ive been reading to my son since he was born hes now and top in his grade for reading were a bookish family and reading is in his blood
IAmA,not_removed,same i read to him all the time but it tends to be while hes pulling himself up on the coffee table and cruising hes listening and hearing so i think its good one day he will want to sit still and pour over the pictures with me i hope but for now being able to stand is far too cool for him also books are tasty
IAmA,not_removed,bedtime stories were my emotional bedrock
IAmA,not_removed,i think her biological sex precludes her from being a kwisatz haderach but since shes started toddling it does feel like she can be many places at once

IAmA,not_removed,as far as i understand it english as a written language almost vanished after the norman invasion of england in ive also read that the vast majority of english words disappeared as well suffice it to say the language is so weird because of a myriad of factors such as the major french influence people trying to make up the spelling again based on pronunciation and the invention of the printing press giving printers major control over the development of the written language basically everyone was just making it up as they went
IAmA,not_removed,they are vocab words as well but each week tries to build up to the next so the words from last week will be in the instructions for next weeks lessons
IAmA,not_removed,so did i i mean learning sightreading is just shy of learning to read hieroglyphs to me the symbol battery meaning that thing that keeps your phone from starving to death is not substantially different from that loopy cross means life i mean hell its never even occurred to me to treat a word as a single symbol rather than a collection of symbols
IAmA,not_removed,me too adding my own data point learned to read by using phonemes and sounds this was in canada in the i just assumed this was the norm everywhere
IAmA,not_removed,this has been drilled into me since birth my whole family and all of my teachers told me to sound it out
IAmA,not_removed,you waited a little bit long if hes in grade
IAmA,not_removed,i was sound it out from the for whatever reason i was reading at a grade level in first grade no preschool or learning to read outside of school and by grade i was highschool grad level which was high as the test went my only thought to this was that mom and grandma read to me while i looked at the pages about every night when i was a toddler
IAmA,not_removed,my kids were in school in the and they learned by sight reading horrible horrible way to teach reading
IAmA,not_removed,so op is a phonetic phoney or not all but some school systems teach this way
IAmA,not_removed,im not denying that home or parental involvement has quite a bit to do with eventual reading skill i just think it has more to do with getting kids reading in the first place than the technique of learning to read i mean if you try something enough times eventually youre going to figure out how to do it and it gets easier as time goes on but for those people who arent taught that letters correspond to sounds and that sounds correspond to words and that you can break a word into those sounds thats like trying to learn to read on hard mode yeah enough involvement will overcome that but it puts the people whose parents arent involved at even more of a disadvantage
IAmA,not_removed,so theyre being taught to recognize words instead of letters i might be a little too dense for this
IAmA,not_removed,with respect to chinese characters there are something like total but a dictionary will only give around an educated individual will learn about and you only need a couple thousand to read a newspaper that aside i would wager the difference between sight reading an actual logogram and words comprised of an alphabet are incomparable chinese characters are small consise and are comprised of a variety of strokes while some words are comprised of multiple characters a single character is easy to take in its complexity at a glance the distinguishing characteristics of the shapes that make up alphabet words aka letters are in no way designed to have meaning inferred from a glance
IAmA,not_removed,sounding out your words severely limits reading speed
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think we ever learned to read in my elementary school it was just learn the abcs learn how to spell these words reading will follow once you know the words by the time first grade rolled around none of the kids seemed to be unable to read so i guess it worked
IAmA,not_removed,fallschurch va we were learning how to sound the words out loud we also learned by sight later on
IAmA,not_removed,also va but late sixties we used the lippincott method which was phonics based described here
IAmA,not_removed,i bet it was northern va they got all the commie teaching theory
IAmA,not_removed,i believe its basically the same idea as whole word reading
IAmA,not_removed,the more you read of this ama the more it looks like this guy is just full of it his main fact isnt even valid a not proficient rating on the naep which he incorrectly calls the narp does not mean not at gradelevel
IAmA,not_removed,the difference may be in engagement but the op is not measuring the data this way and hes only using the sight method as a crutch for the argument making learning a game can greatly increase involvement with it and with involvement increases mastery of any subject
IAmA,not_removed,i also worked in those schools and my experience is the same as that in this excellent comment
IAmA,not_removed,on the surface but i would disagree there were any fundamental changes the concept of audiovisual aids is not new and can be traced back to seventeenth century when john amos comenius a bohemian educator introduced pictures as teaching aids in his book orbis sensualium pictus picture of the sensual world that was illustrated with drawings of everyday life similarly jean rousseau and jh pestalozzi advocated the use of visual and play materials in teaching
IAmA,not_removed,its never the parents or childs fault that the child cannot be persuaded to sit down and participate the teacher obviously hasnt made every minute of the day sufficiently enticing and entertaining of the class may be happily engaged but timmy doesnt wanna do that which is proof that teachers just dont understand children these days math games are stupid make me a better offer entertain me or i will have no choice but disrupt the class source volunteer supervisor of the math manipulatives table it was inevitable that the kids would all enjoy some games more than others but a few saw no reason to complete tasks they didnt prefer
IAmA,not_removed,well it depends on the test then a certain amount of growth is expected in fourth grade if he tests at the beginning of the year and then uses the same scale and metric at the end of the year progress is already expected without intervention the whole thing seems rather unsciencetheheckoutofity to me
IAmA,not_removed,he says in another comment overall of children were in the lower percentile upon entering the class after the completion of lessons only were left in the bottom percentile while were in the upper percentile additionally of readers entered the class at or above the percentile upon completion of the lessons that number grew to and anyone who reads that can tell that its flawed not only are the numbers not matching the title which doesnt match the intro paragraph which then ends up at which says there is something wrong with their numbers they arent examining the improvements between teaching methods of course there will be improvements if you consider the factor of time regardless anyways still interesting though they just need to setup some control groups and test this over a year with multiple schools participating then tune the tools and test it again a second time to see if they can make it more efficient or set it up so schools can tailor their reading tools to their own students
IAmA,not_removed,idk if he has the time for dd
IAmA,not_removed,nerdy pokemon breeding joke
IAmA,not_removed,i will back this up with some market support right now chromebooks make up implementing your game as a web app and hosting it on a website will make it accessible much more broadly to your target audience which appears to be prek through grade students then as upardonmemlady stated you can simply build a wrapper around the web app and bring it to android ipad steam etc love the idea keep up the good work
IAmA,not_removed,theres really not a huge benefit to making it native vs web not like its using loads of native phone functions webwrapper is much more cost effective imo
IAmA,not_removed,it is partly about free advertising but also about commercial exploitation of the companyowned art associated with the brand the company that owns the logo can theoretically claim that your forprofit tv show is benefitting from using their intellectual property and sue you for including artwork that hasnt been cleared by its owner
IAmA,not_removed,forty miles from town are these kids in the middle of montana
IAmA,not_removed,nah invisible monsters or rant an oral biography of buster casey would be better for kids than fight club
IAmA,not_removed,since youre back heres your book 📖
IAmA,not_removed,okay well thats different from learning how to read vocab quizzes will be prevalent until you graduate from high school
IAmA,not_removed,seems to defeat the purpose of an alphabet
IAmA,not_removed,i guess so but thats not helpful to reading in my opinion you have to know what sounds mean now language acquisition thats a completely different animal i would think youd want to learn sounds so you can match the sound the letters make with the word you have heard before my niece cant read yet but she knows what a battery is what she needs to know is what sounds letters make when she sees them if she puts them together and it sounds like battery then shell recognize that word
IAmA,not_removed,i think sight reading might be the basis of speed reading i tried to pick up speed reading tricks but it was just not happening
IAmA,not_removed,weve been dealing with this issue for years
IAmA,not_removed,its how youre naturally reading now have you seen that famous scrambled up text aoccdrnig to rscheearch at cmabrigde uinervtisy it deosnt mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae the rset can be a toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef but the wrod as a wlohe when youre reading youre not sounding out each letter in your brain you justread the problem is that you also have to know how to sound out in order to deal with words you didnt know before etc
IAmA,not_removed,i think so looking online the term sight reading deals more with music but it also talks about introductory reading for words that cant be sounded out like a and the but tbh i feel those words are easy to sound out or figure out with basic phonetics plus it doesnt sound like sight reading is for complex words and is meant for extremely common basic words which in some ways makes sense but teaching kids to sound out basic common words sounds like a better first step to reading from my perspective
IAmA,not_removed,if you teach them apple theyll recognize the word and know how to pronounce it not because a means the ah sound and p makes the puh sound but because they just associate the whole word with a particular pronounciation this leads to trouble because theyll come across other words like appliances and they wont know the pronounciation unless they learn to sound things out themselves
IAmA,not_removed,yes they learn to recognize the word cat instead of sounding out the letters i was pretty shocked when i started volunteering with some local kids and helping them with homework that they were never taught to sound out words
IAmA,not_removed,all the commie teaching theory that leads to the best schools in the country
IAmA,not_removed,i learned it by sound and was raised in nova
IAmA,not_removed,local rich man thinks he knows more about education than actual teachers and researchers news at
IAmA,not_removed,of course audiovisual aids arent new filmstrips slideshows and records were somewhat unique in that they could be massproduced by experts much like you know a textbook filmstrips and audio in particular could create a depth to the material that pictures or text might not be able to you want to show how bad wwii was show them a video dont just read off numbers project a slideshow of pictures onto the wall scratches on the wall of a gas chamber that picture of the guy kneeling before a ditch full of bodies with a gun to the back of his head listen to an audio recording of hitler speaking which will surely provide a better example of his eloquence and ability to control a crowd thus giving the kids a better impression of why he was able to sucker an entire country into such obviously evil acts audiovisual aids arent anything new sure but the new technology allowed a depth to the material that was previously unreachable and allowed massproduced aids that could be produced by worldclass experts who would ordinarily never pay attention to the class youre teaching whether you consider that a fundamental change is up to you
IAmA,not_removed,we have pretty systematically eliminated boredom at all costs in our lives sometimes weve replaced boredom with more subtle forms of allowed boredom but this does seem to cause issues for our children living in a developing country i can see how much the local kids are used to boredom they can sit for hours without getting wound up but the expat kids who are so used to being engaged with constant activity have such trouble sitting still playing quietly
IAmA,not_removed,and it still only talks about bottom and top which could mean changes from to or from to or whatever
IAmA,not_removed,exactly i sure there are tons of filmmakers who would live to give free advertising because its way easier and way more believable to leave the world the way it is rather than going around masking and taping all the logos up
IAmA,not_removed,no arizona they are in the far corner of the county not near any other town so they are bussed in there is a grade school midway to them and the high school miles away but the hs and jrhs require the long trek to the city not uncommon i grew up miles from my high school
IAmA,not_removed,are you serious haunted is much more important to read at a young age especially the first story
IAmA,not_removed,thank you signs book and hands it back to you
IAmA,not_removed,im basically the one teaching her how to read with repetition these quizzes from week to week dont make the words stick in her head long term she knows them for a few weeks and then if she doesnt see them for a while they are gone
IAmA,not_removed,some languages have multiple alphabets for this reason
IAmA,not_removed,it would help if our languages had better phonetic equivalence but yea reading battery is enough to recognize the word from the sound since usually kids learn to talk before they learn to read later on i think we instinctively make words into single symbols you dont need to parse the phonemes to extract the word after youre expetienced
IAmA,not_removed,but i feel like its how i read now because when i learned to read i did sounding it out learned pronunciations and now i sight read sight reading from the beginning seems very weird to me
IAmA,not_removed,actually its not perfect the second letter has to be close to the first letter ex ltteers wouthit and bcuseae are hard to read until your eyes flick over the entire word and see the second letter e i e also most of these words would not make sense outside of context thats not evidence that your brain sees the sentence as a whole it is hard to know what raed is but raed ervey lteter is easy for me to decode i think its just that our brain is pretty good at figuring out what the mistake is and sticking in the right word for the jumbled mess not that we read the word as a whole
IAmA,not_removed,what is really strange is that i had no problem reading through the messy paragraph but once you started spelling words correctly my brain slowed down to register them
IAmA,not_removed,the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae if you use shrot wrods and if the cnsoonnats rmeian in the smae oredr try tihs drootcs wnikrog at hitapsol solhud clusnot sevorisurps ayalws
IAmA,not_removed,the problem with learning sight reading is also presumably that it makes you more likely to mess up similar words just like this youd subconsciously read an unfamiliar word as the most similar word you already know and mispronounce them as a result youd also mix up words youve heard spoken aloud but never seen written down with similar sounding words youve been taught how to readspell its the difference between learning fundamental skills and memorisation eg recognising that is not the same as knowing how to do addition
IAmA,not_removed,well call them appleeyeantsays
IAmA,not_removed,that picture of the guy kneeling before a ditch full of bodies with a gun to the back of his head the picture is called because thats what was written on the back of it it was taken from an einsatzgruppen members personal album
IAmA,not_removed,guts is childs butt play literally now the chick realizing shes eating her own ass that is the best part of haunted
IAmA,not_removed,hold my hirigana im going in
IAmA,not_removed,i believe thats the point it sounds weird because its a terrible way to learn
IAmA,not_removed,you dont sight read from the beginning the path of teaching to read starts at phonemic awareness what is letter what is a sound aka the smallest units of sounds to phonics sounding out parts of words and putting them together from there kids learn to chunk ch unk chunk the final step is sight reading chunk the kid should theoretically not start sight reading their lists of sight words either they first need to make sure they can go down the list and sound each word out then they can move to chunking the words finally they should just know the words sight read them its a step by step process even in the minds of kids who are much quicker at it and also you still
IAmA,not_removed,its not done differently over the pond everywhere just some schools teachers and districts for whatever reason do things the odd and clearly less effective way
IAmA,not_removed,reminds me of goyas famous for its frank and brutal portrayal when the painting saw the light of day its impact on viewers and the art world was substantial
IAmA,not_removed,do you think we had enough and a good enough mix of the right information to let us make an informed decision about who would make the better president
IAmA,not_removed,im in the press team for a national sports federation among other things i also help manage our social media accounts i get the impression that youre thinking about starting a career in that field eh well ama ill answer your original questions later today when i have more time

IAmA,not_removed,whats your favorite anime please tell me you like anime
IAmA,not_removed,hello thank you for doing this ama to be honest im a little upset it hasnt gotten more views can you tell me a trend that is changing in the gaming world that you like and something that you dont like thank you
IAmA,not_removed,hi miz im really looking forward to the new mobile lumines and rez infinite will you ever consider revisiting child of eden has genki rockets been up to anything lately rez is a great game that definitely deserves a hd remaster but i personally liked child of eden better because of genki rockets
IAmA,not_removed,thanks everyone i have to run now to catch my flight to seattle i will be in gamesambas booth so stop by and say hi ill answer more of your questions later this weekend so keep asking
IAmA,not_removed,what inspires you when making games is there a game you are particularly proud of
IAmA,not_removed,for the vr games that your working on do you have any solutions or plans for immersive movement that seems to be the current problem with vr setups
IAmA,not_removed,hi miz where do you get your music inspiration from especially those that have influenced your selection for your games
IAmA,not_removed,hi mizuguchisan my question is about how meteos came about what is the story behind the decision to create meteos how did you first meet masahiro sakurai and what was the experience like working together since it was a game started by my two favorite designers i hope to see another meteos someday thank you for the ama
IAmA,not_removed,hello tetsuya what advice would you give to someone who wants to design games but isnt good with art whats something about the industry that people normally dont realize thanks for doing the ama d
IAmA,not_removed,hello mizuguchisan in your gdc rez postmortem you were talking about including all senses is very important for a game like rez and that this was a big reason to invent the synesthesia suit on the the player had the additional vibrating motor because the gamepads vibration is not sufficient do you have plans for enhanced vibration for rez infinite as well or will the player be limited to the gamepads vibration motors only
IAmA,not_removed,first of all youre amazing now a quick question regarding lumines do you have any plans on bringing it to xbo or pc thanks for all your great work
IAmA,not_removed,hi what mobile games do you play yourself how do they inspire or influence you
IAmA,not_removed,hello my question is a bit of a nerdy one what languages do enjoy coding in and which do you find yourself using most often when developing games im a programmer studying computer science in college and would love some insight thanks
IAmA,not_removed,hello mizuguchisan i loved playing lumines on my psp when i was a kid i put a ton of hours into it will the new lumines game be similar to the original game
IAmA,not_removed,very excited for a new rez game has the process of making a vr game presented any interesting new design challenges you havent encountered when making nonvr games
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for working on rez one of my favorite games what project game or non game have you worked on that youre most proud of
IAmA,not_removed,hello i am an aspiring video game writer and i suppose this is my question what is the best way to break into the industry and finding employment in the writing field has anyone ever told you how they managed to become employed in the industry
IAmA,not_removed,hi mizsan ive been a fan since when i was i even had dreams about rez which i still play looking forward to the version i recall that in an interview around that time you said that the meaning of rez was a secret would you care to tell us what that is
IAmA,not_removed,i always wanted to ask you these two questions though its okay if you answer only the first one i know that rez was developed back when you were at sega and under your uga development team considering that rez was created mainly for the dreamcast and had this arcadey feel to it which was further enhanced with the inclusion of score attack did it never occur to you and the rez team at the time to port it over to segas naomi hardwareboard for an arcade release whats your opinion if any on the numerous sega rally games released after your first one sega rally revo the americaneuropeanonly arcadeexclusive thanks
IAmA,not_removed,who had the idea for the usb rumble pocketpacksex toy that came with rez
IAmA,not_removed,hello again mizuguchisan i am living in fukushima and remember after the time after the disaster being quite stressful losing myself in a session of lumines or rez was a great way to recharge energy and forgot the worries for a while how do you look at games as a way to enrich a persons life or simply relief stress you joined the global game jam at the time do you have any plans for joining or maybe hosting another event like this it surely would be amazing being able to learn some things about developing such immersing gaming experiences as you do from yourself
IAmA,not_removed,hello miz thank you for doing this ama rez is in my opinion one of the best games released for the dreamcast and shows that game design truly is an art form my question is how difficult was it to make sure that the sounds triggered by the player in rez would match up with the backing track regardless of how i play and how fast my reflexes are ive noticed that the firing jingles always mesh perfectly with the bgm also would you ever think of designing another game centred around enhancing a players sense of synesthesia just as rez and child of eden were ive always thought that was a novel concept and would love to see it used in more video have
IAmA,not_removed,what is your estimated release window for rez infinite
IAmA,not_removed,what was the most hectic game youve ever worked on
IAmA,not_removed,rez and space channel are of my favorite games of all time is there any chance for another sequel
IAmA,not_removed,hello mizuguchi i absolutely adore the games and projects you work on and of course am insanely hyped for lumines mobile and rez infinite your creations inspire me and you mean so much to me thank you for your work i got two questions have youve ever been interested in developing a game for a nintendo system are you fond of any of nintendos gameshardware what kind of advice do you have for someone whos looking to develop video games as a future career thank you so so much for your time and doing this ama
IAmA,not_removed,do you have any other events planned to give people a change to try the synesthesia suit here in japan there was an opportunity earlier this year but i missed it even if it comes with a fee attached id be very interested in it maybe something like a tour kyoto tokyo sendai sapporo
IAmA,not_removed,is xbox one backward compatibility for rez hd possible are you working on it i cant wait to get my physical copy of rez infinite but rez hd on xbox one would be great too
IAmA,not_removed,what kinda flight u taking that takes years to arrive
IAmA,not_removed,hi and thanks for this ama you did amazing work im a coder in a different industry currently but i still would like to switch to game coding one day but ive heard unless you have alot of passion for it its not worth the pay and hours you get is that still the case or is the industry getting better especially the console industry because its still pretty exclusive anyone can make an android game these days i guess thanks for your time greetz wv
IAmA,not_removed,lumines was pretty much the only good games when i had my sony erickson phone way back in and the music was fantastic any thoughts of making an android game i love to play this game again
IAmA,not_removed,any chance of seeing more games released on steam i miss rezhd and every extend extra extreme so much since i dont have a anymore
IAmA,not_removed,hey miz is your intercontinental championship run really planned to be never ending
IAmA,not_removed,do you gunpla
IAmA,not_removed,so wut
IAmA,not_removed,has the work of httpsenwikipediaorgwikishigerumiyamoto influenced or inspired you and if the answer is yes do you have any concrete examples
IAmA,not_removed,how long does it take to make a game
IAmA,not_removed,do your prefer playstation or xbox also on that note which did you like more growing up sega or nintendo
IAmA,not_removed,hi tetsuya are you by any chance planning to enter the hentai dating sim market
IAmA,not_removed,any chance you could find a team to remake the warriors classic for current gen consoles
IAmA,not_removed,do you agree that deusexmankind divided shouldve came with mod support
IAmA,not_removed,why is no mans sky so bad
IAmA,not_removed,i like anime i like works by hayao miyazaki for example and like really old disney works too i also really like scifi
IAmA,not_removed,cory in the house
IAmA,not_removed,i dont feel anything i dont really like i think game developers are being challenged into a really creative position due to vr i think the recent rise of smartphone gaming was kind of driving the game dev scene into a very corefocused direction which is sort of being unleashed into a more creative direction due to vr gaming is by its nature very borderless and free its a unique art form i really cant stop being part of this and the arrival of new technology i find to be most exciting i think gaming is a union of technology and art and so i really like how people are being pushed towards a more creative atmosphere
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know yet but i might revisit child of eden in the future genki rockets is in the future now thank you
IAmA,not_removed,life and journey music food people technology art i am emotionally attached to all of them but rez is the first game that i tackled the concept of synesthesia so it holds a special place in my heart i had a lot of trouble with it had to do a lot of thinking and it definitely changed my life as a creator a new game titled rez infinite is coming out as a psvr launch title on october also playable on without psvr this should still be rez at the core but will also be a totally different experience
IAmA,not_removed,one thing that is really important is to prevent vr sickness it has to be a new and fun experience but that is something i really watch out for when making the game vr is a really new experience for everyone so there really isnt a frame of reference video has always had a rectangular frame but now that thats gone the concept of presentation is totally different not to mention the fact that everything is in everything is so new it is so exciting and i have a lot of fun making content in this realm i think this will catch on and people will start really making exciting things on the other hand like i mentioned above this vr sickness issue is also a new problem that we have to be aware of so im really watching out for that too
IAmA,not_removed,inspiration arrives from somewhere lol i actually have no idea i am surrounded by many musicians and sound designers and we often do brainstormingtype sessions where we just bounce ideas off of each other someone comes up with a demo at some point which then bounces off of others to get refined into something more concrete this drive the fun in my games as well i think the audio in a game carries a certain power that drives the fun in games and the brainstorming process is a big part of it we dont actually really sit down and say like hey lets make a song for our game its also very anytime anywhere like sometimes we would meet in a studio to jam or we would just throw ideas at each other over the internet
IAmA,not_removed,i was discussing with sakuraisan about how we can do something new with the two screens we were thinking about doing things in the bottom screen and launching or sending things into the top screen and how to make that feel good with the stylus and meteos was the result as you know sakuraisan is a genius game designer and working with him was super exciting
IAmA,not_removed,whats most important i think is to really love art games are a type of combined art form so theres no need to fixate on visuals or art instead you can focus on the experience so the fast track to getting into game design is to have lots of life experiences and art is only one facet one important aspect of game design is to discover something core like why is this fun why is this beautiful i think game design is about redesigning that experience as a game about the second question people sometimes think game development is very digital and cold but its actually very human emotional and based on instinct you really have to go face to face with the human side of things of course the digital stuff is important too but its a balance
IAmA,not_removed,the current plan is to work with the technology that is available to us please look forward to hearing from us soon about this i cannot stress enough that i have a strong desire to do something in the synesthesia suit realm however our plans for a suit is still in its investigation phase i do have the desire to one day create a suit and deliver it to people who want one how much would you pay for a new synesthesia suit
IAmA,not_removed,some day lumines will continue to evolve
IAmA,not_removed,in the past i spent an unhealthily long time at the arcades i played a lot of shooters like rtype and racing games one day i ran into a huge game called and i thought who came up with this monster it said sega so thats where i went more recently i spend a lot of time on the games i work on its really hard to come up with the time to really sit down and play other games which is very sad i also spend a lot of time thinking about future games like things that tie mobile gaming to vr that i mentioned in a previous question playing them in my head one thing to note is that i get a lot of inspiration for my games outside of gaming music traveling life in general
IAmA,not_removed,the hardware is different but the gameplay feel should be the same it might take a bit of time to get used to but once you get the hang of it you should be able to play it like the old days one of the bigger differences is the landscapeportrait change but its a part of the game that id love for you to enjoy
IAmA,not_removed,oh tons creating things for vr is almost totally new compared to nonvr for example in the past no matter how big your imagination was you had to confine your end result into a rectangular view frame of some sort now in vr you dont have that constraint at all which is huge i think that is an enormous challenge that many creators all over the world are tackling and i expect something really exciting to come out in a few years from now right now we are at the brink of a new discovery a new experience and i find these moments most exciting because of this i am in a chaotic state of fun and challenge and difficulty i personally think that my work in synesthesia will really take off and explode into something huge in vr not just rez but a lot of other things i think can be done
IAmA,not_removed,what most everyone does is to just dive in as an intern or whatever just really get started with it and start experiencing i know a lot of people for example who started as a game journalist and transitioned to a creative role inside game development so thats one good route i think
IAmA,not_removed,yeah miz tell us the meaning of rez secrets dont make friends
IAmA,not_removed,i think its a very important aspect we want to live a better life a happier life and we do lots of things to achieve that i think its natural that gaming is a choice that is available for that end and i am very glad that it is games i think is a kind of mirror that reflects a persons desire or dreams i always hope that i can add to that in some way make someones day a bit happier or something like that i think that positive influence feeds back into the rest of a persons life being able to bounce that back and forth would be great
IAmA,not_removed,technologically speaking it wasnt that difficult in my opinion it was getting to that idea though that took a lot of time for example i had the entire team join a drum workshop and talk about the mechanism behind how syncing up with others feels good we worked with like a musical callresponse paradigm and thought about how to apply that in gaming things we kind of take for granted in life if we wanted to apply that to games we really have to analyze it and turn it into a logical paradigm this is a process that i find to be really fun and exciting of course i am thinking about doing more synesthesia in games i dont think ive come up with a masterpiece at all yet so that will have to be created before i give up i think vr will definitely enhance synesthesia significantly if for example we were able to combine that with mobile we would be able to enjoy synesthesia freely in any environment which would unlock a whole new creative avenue thats the kind of dreaming i am doing now
IAmA,not_removed,october
IAmA,not_removed,rez and space channel
IAmA,not_removed,we are aware that the demand for this kind of thing is really high we dont have concrete plans yet and we designed the new mobile lumines around the concept of touch controls so we believe it is enjoyable without an external controller please give it a shot and let us know
IAmA,not_removed,i hope so
IAmA,not_removed,you didnt specify one anime that is your favorite
IAmA,not_removed,macross or gundam
IAmA,not_removed,if you havent seen it then please watch disneys black cauldron incredibly dark animated movie for disney
IAmA,not_removed,thanks not sure if this is allowed but here goes a followup question did you receive any formal music training growing up do you play any instruments
IAmA,not_removed,id probably pay up to for it i guess
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,i think he was basically just saying that he likes all anime and doesnt really have a favorite thats what i got from that anyway

IAmA,not_removed,i like your mugs how much do you care if i just take one with me when i leave
IAmA,not_removed,how often do people ask to talk to a manager also where do you guys get the crack that you put in your coffee
IAmA,not_removed,im from the uk and waffle house is one of my very favourite places in the us a couple of years ago i wanted to get a souvenir and asked if the coffee mugs were for sale our waitress said sure bucks and i gladly bought one ive always wondered if they really are for sale or if she was just feeling particularly entrepreneurial that evening not that im complaining we left on a check either way added question marks for auto moderator second edit it seems my phrasing about the tip was off the check was we left in cash on the table i gave the waitress in cash directly in exchange for the mug

IAmA,not_removed,do you like waffles can you pm me waffles
IAmA,not_removed,whats the largest tip you have ever gotten i say this because i got hammered out on town in kansas city and made my way back to a city in missouri called belton i ordered about dollars worth of food for myself and took two bites of food and then left dollars and walked out it hurt the next morning when i realized what i did but some sassy black lady got a nice tip

IAmA,not_removed,goddamn i love wh like ive dated two different girls who worked there in two different states almost entirely for the hook up but for real though do you guys have policy for dealing with drunk and disorderly customers i have noticed annoying drunk white girls get delt with pretty quick whereas big angry dudes are basically just allowed to do what the fuck ever i get it from a standpoint of personal safety but is there policy
IAmA,not_removed,my ten year old selfs old password was iwuvvleswaffles my ten year old self can go fuck themselves
IAmA,not_removed,i personally hate making salads because we have no fucking shredded cheese i mean what kind of fucking shit is that we have to cut cheese slices cheese slices for salads it actually tastes alright though lol
IAmA,not_removed,as a cook dont order a wrap when we are anything more than dead empty theyre a pain in the ass to make and they take up the entire grill
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely because my coworkers are angels that dont charge me even though theyre supposed to haha i always leave a fat tip though obviously edit i see this is looked down upon but honestly its not as if i order out of my means and i always leave enough for the price and then some if they dont choose to write me a ticket im not going to break their arm about it
IAmA,not_removed,liquor probably
IAmA,not_removed,butter
IAmA,not_removed,police have been called times in the time ive worked there only once were they useful so we dont bother most of the time
IAmA,not_removed,if waffle house realizes the stupidest thing theyve ever done is get rid of them maybe
IAmA,not_removed,id say once or twice a week courteous customers make it into the toilets or in the grass otherwise its all over the walls and shitter of the bathroom or in the parking lot for the cooks to clean up
IAmA,not_removed,allstar definitely because you get the most for your buck like in a earlier comment we have a price chart with stuff that isnt even on the menu but it isnt that much like chicken omelettes waffle sandwiches etc
IAmA,not_removed,we have a regular we actually do make pancakes for but honestly if we were caught doing it wed be in deep shit
IAmA,not_removed,thats sort of comforting people come and go but waffle house will live on
IAmA,not_removed,i really want to know what the question was for this reply
IAmA,not_removed,actually im more like thats it even though i do know how filling they are
IAmA,not_removed,id rather hear werk werk werk werk werk on replay for an hour than two minutes of raaasisins raaaasins in my toast
IAmA,not_removed,probably a double hashbrown double covered with cheese and ham yes scrambled eggs with cheese and ham and a piece of chicken no toast though already had his carbs for the day
IAmA,not_removed,no we dont get paid enough lol
IAmA,not_removed,plenty most sketchy and recent happened just a few days ago some dude stumbled in went to the mens room was in there an hour before a cook banged on the door telling him if he wasnt going to eat get the hell out of dodge after yelling five more minutes the dude left cook checked back in the restroom dirty needles and blood everywhere was not pretty from what ive heard
IAmA,not_removed,go to any waffle house past midnight its seriously the most interesting glimpse of humanity on earth like anthropologists should sit there and study the overweight prostitute yelling at the shirtless year old homeless man asking for money while the college kids argue about if aegislash belongs in ubers and the trucker hopped up on edit apparently coming down from amphetamines orders his waffle
IAmA,not_removed,probably the cheesesteak if i had to recommend anything best deal though is the allstar since you get a waffle for just ¢ more what a steal it was the crunch berry waffle blueberry and strawberry mixed together until those damn corporate bastards took them both away because of food cost which was probably the stupidest thing ever
IAmA,not_removed,ha nice man but yeah totally we got a system for how we call out orders and how shit goes out where the jelly is placed dictates how the eggs are cooked jelly type determines toast and a whole bunch of other complicated stuff lol
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,ok ill ask whats an old fashioned
IAmA,not_removed,its called the mark system but yeah the jelly packets placement tells you how the eggs are cooked the packet is placed right side up for white toast upside down for wheat toast substituted for apple butter for raisin toast then for hashbrowns you place a piece of whatever needs to go in them at the bottom of the plate with a single hashbrowns strand
IAmA,not_removed,what mug
IAmA,not_removed,we run a decent shift so it doesnt regularly happen hell id probably say times a month all in the bean baby
IAmA,not_removed,you can absolutely take a coffee cup that means i have one less cup to wash if you have a cool waitresswaiter and ask if you can buy one they may just tell you to stick it in your pocket otherwise just steal it we may just call you its that one guy that took the coffee cup lol i can most certainly say its probably because of the cooks it gets hot as shit up on that grill line especially when its busy and you got a lot of bodies behind the counter i even get super hot and sweaty running around making coffee setting people up while getting the high bar drinks then having to rush over to take my food out
IAmA,not_removed,probably entrepreneurial i had a lady ask if she could buy our shitty version of steak sauce i found an unopened one and told her bucks she gave me a fiver for it then left a dollar tip to be fair she was drunk off her ass but still god i wish shed come in more often like that
IAmA,not_removed,i think waffle house is one of the best representations of deep america the equality of everybody when sitting in front of hashbrowns the unity of people after goodbad booze the representation of sticktoyour ribs food and the fact that waffle house makes herculean efforts to be open in areas of natural disasters and help people out
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely ive found out bitches cant throw worth shit
IAmA,not_removed,nah i feel like we got the upper hand on pancake hut
IAmA,not_removed,ugh yes i dont like togo orders that often unless they come in and place it mostly because answering the phone and then being put on hold because they actually didnt know what they wanted before they called backs me up majorly even a bigger fuck you to me if theres multiple people in the background wanting something aint nobody got time for that
IAmA,not_removed,that is severely accurate haha we have one customer we call the pie guy and try to hide a piece of chocolate pie for him
IAmA,not_removed,frozen sadly they still taste good though to me im no food connoisseur however bonus probably everything tastes fresh when youre drunk
IAmA,not_removed,can confrim this is a real thing took a risk management class in college and we talked about it its called the waffle ouse index looks to see if the waffle houses in that area are serving a full menu limited menu or closed completely httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwafflehouseindex
IAmA,not_removed,do you know were probably even more stoned
IAmA,not_removed,well this really drunk lady and her surprisingly sober husband came in one night like shes wobbling in through the front door and were all like oh boy she sits in my section yay now im a pretty laid back person not aggressive at all and i take things lightly i get their drinks and she asks if she can hug me i say yeah of course she leans over the booth and hugs be its alright here but then heres how the rest goes does this make you uncomfortable eh not really ive had worse i respond loosening myself from the hug well i can make you really uncomfortable then proceeds to shove her whole tongue into my ear then after is all said and done and i had sanitized my ear and taken their order she starts asking the other waitresses if they want to get assaulted too
IAmA,not_removed,wait dont jews not eat bacon i imagine jewish people bacon would be turkey bacon or veggie bacon
IAmA,not_removed,redditor as of weeks ago man you made your account at the perfect time
IAmA,not_removed,fifty smackaoonies on christmas eve boy was i proud of that sucker still am i can only hope ill get a bigger one than that one day haha
IAmA,not_removed,strangely no ive asked my favorite coworkers to join me though
IAmA,not_removed,a priest comes in once a week and douses them with holy butter spray
IAmA,not_removed,you can get them smothered get them covered
IAmA,not_removed,you can get hash browns like that toothe secret is soaking them in water then drying them out again this removes the starches that prevent yours at home from becoming crispy this works with fries too
IAmA,not_removed,thats awful poor girl
IAmA,not_removed,my husband is a manager at wh and every employee has his phone number and they use it frequently but yes his office is locked when he isnt there
IAmA,not_removed,i was waiting for the part where you get take over the grill then the two of you are married now
IAmA,not_removed,yeah your food is almost done too
IAmA,not_removed,no i dont think anybody in my store has actually met him not even the managers ill have to ask the district if i ever get the chance to see him again
IAmA,not_removed,fucking dan
IAmA,not_removed,probably the mini cast iron skittle we have all it takes is your eggs two slices of american cheese and put it in after its melted and stir im stealing one once i quit
IAmA,not_removed,no ive gotten pretty much everyone ive asked though to see my tits since i got them pierced thats rewarding
IAmA,not_removed,i guess only in texas most people here have common courtesy not to smoke but if they ask if they can after that whole ordeal with that waitress getting shot in the head over telling some guy not to smoke we tell em we didnt see nothin
IAmA,not_removed,as a dallas native there is an unspoken rule they keep ashtrays behind the counter but if a cop decides to waltz in while you are killin a pack its your ass play the game pay the price
IAmA,not_removed,yeeeeeeeeeah probably not going to happen oh well at least ill sleep good tomorrow morning
IAmA,not_removed,i kept waiting for this to say treefiddy at the end lol and then it turned out to be an actual story good vibes to you man and i hope youre doing well life moves on and who knows what amazing things youll be doing with amazing people in twenty years
IAmA,not_removed,shit i cant believe this is coming so late i have a rather incredible story that will never again be so relevant but at least one guy will read it while working as a teacher i cooked the night shift at waffle house student loans be crazy night shift was slow so i slept from and did all my grading and lesson plans during the off hours worked out pretty great honestly anyway one morning while im prepping the grill for the next shift this guy comes in orders a coffee and looks like hes in shellshock the waitress i was with at the time might literally have been the worst person to ever exist so i put down what i was doing and asked him if he needed anythin just as a conversation starter i wanna be clear about one thing we had a lot of lonely old veterans slightly overweight in dirty clothes usually with scruff who came in looking shellshocked as well id talk to these guys as well but i understood why they looked that way as soon as i saw them life had just dealt them a shit card this guy was clean cut well dressed in a nice car he came in at am so it didnt add up at all i pride myself on being a man who people open up to about their life i love listening to people who are hurting and ignored working at waffle house provided lots of these opportunities so does being a teacher for that matter unfortunately when i sat down with this guy i could get nothing out of him and whats crazy was he wanted to talk to me so i told him to tell me what happened he was trying incredibly hard but nothing he said made a whole lotta sense and all mumbled things like i just cant believe it theres nothing i can do to protect her shes not going to be ok life is so unfair i think she was texting she got in a crash im going to see her i can only have coffee i have to go pick her up then we just sat there a minute while i said nothing waiting to see if hed say anything else nothing i say im sorry that happened and he says nothing then when i get up from the table he gets up pays for his coffee thanks me and leaves so im confused and of course assume she got injured in a car wreck but i specifically remember thinking how he wouldnt be going to pick her up if she were injured badly and the way he looked wouldnt make sense for a small injury so i to my parents house that day and my mother loves to share morbid news stories with me so when she sees me she immediately asks if i heard what happened yesterday i say no and she tells me this story there was a bus carrying a youth group to a water park when one of the tires blew out a man stopped to help them change the tire it was around a curve though and a freshman in college rounded it while texting going about and pinned the guy against the van he died within minutes the van being flung backwards also seriously injured one of the children i cant be sure but i would bet my life savings the guy i was talking to at the waffle house was her dad and he just couldnt bring himself to tell the story it was still not real it was an extremely surreal moment when my mom told me the news story one where the world felt way too small and all the narratives made too much sense i wish i could have done more to help that guy though life is crazy
IAmA,not_removed,thank you very much for this story im going through something similar myself does it get better and how are you doing now
IAmA,not_removed,me if youre lucky
IAmA,not_removed,haha we have other stuff too like hash browns and eggs but to go about moving your best bet would be atlanta i hear they got one on every corner
IAmA,not_removed,waffle house is where youll see the real america not at all fancy and everyone dem or republican goes there at least in the parts of the country where they have them it is a version of a diner which is kind of a specific kind of restaurant no alcohol most of the stuff can be cooked quickly usually on a flat top grill
IAmA,not_removed,policy is if you havent order anything to eat you only get two refills but if you do get something its unlimited assuming you did and it wasnt busy your server was lazy or i hate to say it shitty if it was busy they shouldve still made rounds to see if you needed one sorry man
IAmA,not_removed,yeah every time somebody asks for a budlight or rum n coke anything i just tell em were out i still enjoy the joke but i bet i wont the longer i work here haha
IAmA,not_removed,personally i like them well in the ring smothered and with worcestershire as for secret menu we actually have this pricing chart with a lot of stuff that isnt actually on the menu like chicken omelettes waffle sandwiches etc
IAmA,not_removed,we have one celebrity i guess youd call him that comes in every once in awhile his names dusty hes a rapper i think
IAmA,not_removed,finally an unacceptable amount of scrolling to get to that one
IAmA,not_removed,feels like i just came out of an intellectual closet yes i read feel much better now
IAmA,not_removed,its a temple where drunk americans go to atone for the sins of the night its basically a room x with an open grillkitchen area separated by a dining counter and a jukebox you go in sit down and ask for forgiveness from the lord and protection from the devil that is the hangover everybody is stoned drunk or hungover or a combination thereof a meal for four might cost maybe its cheap its good and its open hours and theyre bulletproof fuckers are open selling scrambled eggs as hurricanes are making landfall right on top of them the national guard stops in and asks for coffee when disasters are on its incredible
IAmA,not_removed,ihop for the food waffle house for the show
IAmA,not_removed,no idea but it was pretty much a one time thing so i dont mind ill just do back to lurking like usual
IAmA,not_removed,actually yes most people getting off work from warehouses or bartenders themselves we get occasional sober strippers too
IAmA,not_removed,id rather be cuntpounded by a steel beam than listen to it
IAmA,not_removed,they got in a fight with meth and lost

IAmA,not_removed,really damn clean actually new customers always come in from other waffle houses and compliment us all the time how its the cleanest one theyve ever been in
IAmA,not_removed,man i wanna be a cook where they are thats not true in my area at all its more than minimum wage though so thats good i guess
IAmA,not_removed,apparently long ago there was a customer that was really good at drawing horses and he jerked himself off under the table to his drawings
IAmA,not_removed,take money out of your check every day you work regardless if you eat or not
IAmA,not_removed,i went to waffle house after a party once im sitting there underage drunk as piss and i hear yelling from outside when i looked up i can see outside a man and a woman arguing the woman gets in her car and runs him down he just lays there in the parking lot and i shit you not she walks inside and get her waffle house to go order then just leaves like nothing happened come to think of it that might have been the craziest thing i have ever seen
IAmA,not_removed,finish everything huh one tbone two porkchops double toast hashbrowns eggs city ham sausage and a waffle i think that beats the guy with eggs haha
IAmA,not_removed,we didnt get rid of it you just have to ask for the full menu i know its bullshit but we have two different ones ones full of favorites with shit paired up together so its easier for people to choose the other one has everything we got on it
IAmA,not_removed,honestly on a good night i can do by myself in my tiny section and make back this is all dependent on whats going on in town seasons and how many waitresses there are
IAmA,not_removed,i mean i guess they love me on the inside because guess what ive been eating ha
IAmA,not_removed,no but i made a waffle dick put it in the fridge and forgot about it and my boss found it whoops
IAmA,not_removed,awhile ago we had a list of all the regulars we thought we cute and every time one of them would come in especially peanut butter guy wed start giggling and stupid girly shit i wanted a better view so i decided id start my sweeping side work early my coworker totally busted me out you never sweep this early whatre you looking at i had to go out for a smoke break and i dont even smoke i was laughing so hard i was hissing
IAmA,not_removed,i heard she quit smoking cigarettes and is now doing amas on her phone outback
IAmA,not_removed,sorry man to get to you so late technically we are all that older lady even the non smokers heeeeeeey
IAmA,not_removed,how the shit does every waffle house have this do they get shut down if they dont have an old lady out back smoking
IAmA,not_removed,i want my promotion by tomorrow then
IAmA,not_removed,dont make it too thick so it isnt like concrete after sitting for awhile biscuits dunno i personally like the weight on them so theyre brown and crunchy lol youre not supposed to do that
IAmA,not_removed,yeees we do we rarely unplug the jukebox but if we did moneys kind of gone and the customers not getting it back unfortunately
IAmA,not_removed,nope but i have seen a girl get proposed to in the parking lot because the waffle house i work at is where they supposedly met we made them a special waffle as congratulations
IAmA,not_removed,i laughed upvote my man
IAmA,not_removed,my boss is cheap sadly ive only gotten two shirts three name tags one apron one hat and three ties in the years ive been there whats worse is ive gotten more stuff than the girl thats been there years
IAmA,not_removed,yup just like we notice when you turn your brights on while getting a blow job from that prostitute you hired
IAmA,not_removed,zero but i do have a regular that flashes me pressing his boobs against the glass
IAmA,not_removed,well if its any consolation i wear chokers to work and people say i either look like wednesday adams or lydia from beetlejuice
IAmA,not_removed,honestly if she goes out of her way to talk to you ask how youre doing and whatnot she probably likes you as a customer and person we always ask our regulars if theyre feeling alright if theyre not as talkative or strangely quietly so thats a hint too im no psychologist though
IAmA,not_removed,i hope so thatd be stellar man
IAmA,not_removed,nope only time i got a raise is when i almost quit
IAmA,not_removed,im surprised they let him stay in there
IAmA,not_removed,if youre laughing having a good time hell even a little obnoxious we most of the time dont judge we only do that if you literally cannot walk like someone has to carry your ass or youre falling asleep at the table
IAmA,not_removed,be funny and leave a decent tip
IAmA,not_removed,not awkward but really off putting recently during trumps speech he made a few weeks ago i dont really follow that stuff even though i should a customer came in and motioned me over not even my table but the first thing he said to me is i have a weird request and youre going to do it what am i going to do well he wanted to pay for some tables meals which is nice of him because of this whole thing but was really condescending talking about politics and how hes glad were voting for trump and all got irritated when we werent smiling washing dishes then told a waitress she had an attitude because she wasnt paying attention to him
IAmA,not_removed,he was super nice but yknow still weird he paid another waitress to flush some pictures he had of his ex down the toilet because he had ptsd from a trash compactor and had a phobia of throwing stuff away he ended up giving her a twenty dollar tip essentially so good for her
IAmA,not_removed,not yet but a long time ago this guy who was obviously stoned out of his mind didnt have enough money for a tip he said be right back hes going to walmart he came back with some shit hed stolen most memorable some headphones a mini bluetooth speaker and some floss picks guess who got a mini speaker
IAmA,not_removed,some say he is still high to this very day
IAmA,not_removed,ive made queaso cheesesteak quesadilla and most recently ive learned how to make barbecue chicken out of all the stuff we have in the condiment baskets
IAmA,not_removed,honestly yes it was fucking hilarious i almost peed myself when someone who doesnt know pull drop mark its funny hearing how they think you call it out
IAmA,not_removed,definitely covered and chunked
IAmA,not_removed,if anyone wants to hear the story youll have to privately pm me forsecurity reasons haha
IAmA,not_removed,we seriously appreciate it but its not expected theres always a togo charge usually that goes on our check and taxed though
IAmA,not_removed,no stories but ive heard of that
IAmA,not_removed,honestly we usually run that sort of person off in our store i guess they cant handle our upbeat attitude and unwillingness to deal with their bitchattude but yeah this kind of place does somehow like a moth to a flame bring those types of people here
IAmA,not_removed,everything is a sexual innuendo everything
IAmA,not_removed,they aint got nothin better to do thats what i think anyway
IAmA,not_removed,okay going to be honest maybe just maybe but the cooks do all the smothered covered peppered all that shit and we have to do the gravy and chili ourselves when youre in a rush and dont look at your tickets you kind of forget about it most the time if i forget while im pricing your check ill mentally punch myself in the gut before taking it off and apologising
IAmA,not_removed,pm second shift is always worst
IAmA,not_removed,well thats rude we have a lady who gets an all the way hashbrown with chilly and an egg on top of the whole thing so that sounds pretty basic to me just more complicated for the cooks youre fine man or dudette which ever you prefer
IAmA,not_removed,ive never had a pick up line used on me but i use plenty of them
IAmA,not_removed,not sure off the type of my head but ill check tonight man
IAmA,not_removed,theres a key somewhere but god knows where my husband is a manager and doesnt have a key but theres a very pointless lock
IAmA,not_removed,i would imagine go to the waffle house website and keep sending in emails how you want one in your area thats all i can think of
IAmA,not_removed,it depends mine isnt that big so six servers is the maximum but with three good ones on a shift we can knock that shit out of the park depends on the servers but if theres three you get two booths and rotate the highbar or get the low bar to yourself average price id say about for your basic allstar and drink which i sadly remember nothing added to it though prefer not to say and going on three years
IAmA,not_removed,i personally like the waffle sandwich its basically a ham and cheese on wheat put in the waffle maker god its good at least if they do it right
IAmA,not_removed,havent heard it actually i know one of my bosses likes it though
IAmA,not_removed,nah theyd take that shit all to themselves or share with the coworkers first lol
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt do nothing to be angry and bitter all the time gotta have some laughs yo
IAmA,not_removed,any meat we got bacon sausage ham country ham chicken and i guess you could get a steak if you wanted
IAmA,not_removed,you gotta have nerves of steel man and the ability not to have a panic attack when you get busy normally id say it takes about a month for you to be able to hold your own and handle a minimal rush
IAmA,not_removed,i had a few most two most memorable one got chased off because hed stay for hours on end talking about computers and video games which i didnt mind but it gets old after awhile people actually thought he was my boyfriend because he was in so often one was really sweet at first and gave me gifts then got mad and called me a whore and asked for everything back okay buddy deuces lol
IAmA,not_removed,probably byproduct but honestly thats really gross my managers and all higher ups would have a fit if that happened im pretty sure most of us servers would kick the cook out if they did that too and just make our own shit thats our money man
IAmA,not_removed,the wraps theyre really good but a pain in the ass to make
IAmA,not_removed,it ranges really its pretty even on my shift right now three and this includes me and three
IAmA,not_removed,all you can do is believe
IAmA,not_removed,in case of emergency
IAmA,not_removed,often hell im not going to say anything to somebody with a loaded gun lol my jobs policy isnt worth my left eye socket
IAmA,not_removed,it can be extremely exhausting but if you have a good crew and yall can laugh and pick fun at each other the night goes by quick tips only get split if the customer says to im extremely amendment about giving money to the person im supposed to be sharing it with in front of the customer for honestys sake
IAmA,not_removed,none technically youre not even supposed to be on property on your days off
IAmA,not_removed,they are pretty good and it only takes probably three minutes to make them so easy stoner or drunk food for someone whose impatient
IAmA,not_removed,dandelion and ill say no more
IAmA,not_removed,which ever can comprehend the menu and order faster
IAmA,not_removed,its not a bad place to learn the ropes of waitressing but if you have some shady coworkers there dont get involved in anything they do it just causes trouble and thats with any place really
IAmA,not_removed,one time i got a five dollar bill folded into a mini polo shirt i really enjoyed that i kept fucking around with co workers pretending i was wearing it while singing fat guy in a littttle coat
IAmA,not_removed,no plan that i know of we just go with the flow and play on our phones if the power goes out haha
IAmA,not_removed,not till tonight at nine o clock
IAmA,not_removed,nah but i like to record them
IAmA,not_removed,uneasy lol
IAmA,not_removed,with the hashbrowns sizzling and bacon popping on the grill to the air vents over them somebody doing dishes and running the sanitizer behind them and a restaurant full of customers talking its seriously friggin hard to hear somebody talking normally
IAmA,not_removed,anybody whose rude and doesnt tip
IAmA,not_removed,ha sweet man in all my time ive worked here the only time we kicked somebody out is because they brought beer inside and were drinking it at the table
IAmA,not_removed,what kind of puss orders a salad at waffle house i am almost vegan and i still would not expect any kind of salad from waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,if thats not the damn truth those drunken waffle house meals are borderline orgasmic
IAmA,not_removed,please its margarine aint no buttah in the waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,but dude deets why did you have to call the police in the first place what went down
IAmA,not_removed,pls its my only reason for life
IAmA,not_removed,when they read this ama they will
IAmA,not_removed,do the cooks have to clean up vomit only or do they perform other janitorial duties
IAmA,not_removed,i have heard of a waffle sandwich but when i asked if it was a sandwich made with waffles i was laughed at so i still have no idea what it is care to inform me please
IAmA,not_removed,thatd be hilarious at your next job interview so why were you fired from waffle house oh i cooked a flat waffle because a customer really wanted a pancake
IAmA,not_removed,but why
IAmA,not_removed,we only make plaid pancakes in this establishment
IAmA,not_removed,house waffle we do not close
IAmA,not_removed,challenge accepted
IAmA,not_removed,what about plays of tom joness whats new pussycat
IAmA,not_removed,when i was around my best friend and i would put like in the juke box right before we were about to leave we would play a couple songs we wanted to hear then like waffle house songs for after we left im sorry
IAmA,not_removed,what about special lady at the waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,that sounds like s power lifter meal
IAmA,not_removed,just reading this makes me feel like i need to take a dump
IAmA,not_removed,ron swanson
IAmA,not_removed,how much would they have to pay you for you to dance whenever the song comes on
IAmA,not_removed,i worked there for a summer i was always needed in the kitchen when one of those songs came on at an hour people were lucky i didnt throw their food at them not a fucking chance i was going to dance
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i worked at a burger joint in portland oregon and in some of the more seedy areas we have a huge drug problem we had to install sharps boxes in all the bathrooms because our coworkers were picking up dozens actual dozones of needles on a daily basis i worked there for months and probably saw drug users kicked out and thats a very rough estimate i cant even count the amount of them we didnt kick out ugh i will not miss that on a few occasions my manager actually had to call the police to come collect bags of crystal
IAmA,not_removed,when you gotta go
IAmA,not_removed,visit any waffle house between say and youll see proof of the adage the freaks come out at night
IAmA,not_removed,this is a great description except for the fact that amphetamines suppress your appetite pretty effectively
IAmA,not_removed,aegislash needs to be brought down to ou with hoopa and deoxysd
IAmA,not_removed,nobody is eating a single waffle let alone while high on amphetamines thats when theyre driving truckers coming down from amphetamines might be ordering a coffee and pancakes after not eating for hours but no way waffles while theyre high
IAmA,not_removed,or if youre a regular and know how to eat cheaply get originals with no cheese burger and a water then tip your waitress meal and once you become a regular the waitresses will give you soda and put a w on the ticket and after a while the cook has those originals going before you even get in the door when you pull up i get mine with toasted buns easier for the cook and not greasy and burnt buns oh and do not fucking complain if your original is a bit too done your bun is stale etc stfu youre eating a dollar burger get over it edit thanks anonymous waffle house person now when i go to breakfast tomorrow and get my triple over medium sub grits for double toast dry light wheat i will open reddit on my phone and show my people there that i got gilded over a waffle house discussion
IAmA,not_removed,used to get a blueberry waffle almost daily my fav go to stoner food and local waffle house is a mile away from my house then one day they told me they dont have blueberry waffles anymore so i noped the fuck out
IAmA,not_removed,no joke being told the blueberry waffles were discontinued was one of the saddest days of my life im still not completely over it
IAmA,not_removed,this might explain why i randomly got a packet of mustard with my country ham dinner once
IAmA,not_removed,httpimgurcomtsllvox
IAmA,not_removed,thats fing amazing
IAmA,not_removed,what is this its like a secret language
IAmA,not_removed,not the right person but i just assumed it was a handy
IAmA,not_removed,its a cocktail where im from but then again ive never been to a waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,a good ol hand jibber
IAmA,not_removed,this might be the greatest ama ever
IAmA,not_removed,i knew those stuffed animals had secret value
IAmA,not_removed,thats makes sense about the cooks i appreciate the reply
IAmA,not_removed,every kitchen of every restaurant ive worked in has been hot as balls so this makes sense try asking for something on the fly in a kitchen where the air conditioner broke during a crazy brunch shift in the middle of ramadan with an all muslim cooking crew ive never come closer the death by chefs knife
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i used to work at one as a waitress theyre literally only bucks
IAmA,not_removed,used to work at a wh theyre literally bucks and you have to put it on a separate ticket and stuff it in the drop box
IAmA,not_removed,during the snowpocalypse on the east coast this january waffle house was the only thing i could find open in richmond va saved my life
IAmA,not_removed,i wanted to marry you since the third reply you made
IAmA,not_removed,and crepe teepee never stood a chance
IAmA,not_removed,the waffle house is closed i repeat the waffle house is closed
IAmA,not_removed,this is one of those things that sounded really fake and yet the link is real
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,this is why i love waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,its a lot like this onion article
IAmA,not_removed,and the worst
IAmA,not_removed,karma insider trading at its finest
IAmA,not_removed,aaaaannnd
IAmA,not_removed,i cant believe it
IAmA,not_removed,her manager had an oversight issue apparently i have become a manager in restaurants since this happened and it is definitely a situation i think about when training
IAmA,not_removed,i hear its the highest honor one can achieve in the waffle house ranks good luck to you and god speed
IAmA,not_removed,that was after waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,skittle taste the rainbow
IAmA,not_removed,upmmeyourtitsgirl would prolly like to see them
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwseattletimescomnationworldwaitressshottodeathafteraskingcustomertoputoutsmoke
IAmA,not_removed,do you want a good tip because thats how you get a good tip
IAmA,not_removed,i lived about minutes outside of atlanta in a pretty small town bars no starbucks but we did have waffle houses no joke
IAmA,not_removed,i think waffle house is still largest seller of tbone steaks in america dint forget the sandwich options burgers chicken texas bacon cheesesteak my personal favorite dont sell the waffle house short its way more than a breakfast joint
IAmA,not_removed,atlanta native here can confirm i have literally sat in one waffle house looked out the window and saw another one a mile down the road
IAmA,not_removed,from atlanta can confirm
IAmA,not_removed,live in georgia can confirm deliciousness everywhere
IAmA,not_removed,waffle sandwiches so could i get like a waffle hashbrown patty melt
IAmA,not_removed,dusty the rapper holy shit i have no idea who that is
IAmA,not_removed,wayell it looks like we got ourselves a reeduh
IAmA,not_removed,dear god that place sounds amazing one for the bucket list
IAmA,not_removed,i disagree i think the food at waffle house is so much better than ihop plus waffles pancakes
IAmA,not_removed,youre pretty funny and had interesting responses hell you should lurk less and post more judging by front page status im not the only one who shares this opinion
IAmA,not_removed,where i used to work in georgia it was the only thing open at you brought food to work or ate waffle house on the night shift
IAmA,not_removed,the biggest surprise here is learning that there is such a thing as a sober stripper
IAmA,not_removed,oddly specific but understandable
IAmA,not_removed,ama champion
IAmA,not_removed,you shouldve asked why he isnt working
IAmA,not_removed,shift fucks with your sleep schedule hard
IAmA,not_removed,you just started this year and are already a division trainer good for you
IAmA,not_removed,im just a customer at a waffle house wondering why i cant get any service
IAmA,not_removed,i hope this continues all the way to the ceo
IAmA,not_removed,man i really hope im not in trouble for this could i interested you in a coke cola my treat
IAmA,not_removed,uh oh looks like we found the big dick
IAmA,not_removed,i was courted at a job fair when i was in undergrad to start a career with waffle house i always wondered how my life wouldve gone had i just taken the offer any thoughts you could share also the job fair was hilarious i went mostly for free shit and the waffle house table was emptyno one behind it and just a stack of free waffle coupons as soon as i picked one up a guy standing near the table but in front of it steps and says now that youve taken a free waffle you have to hear me out fantastically cornered by social standards to hear him out so at least he had his shit together
IAmA,not_removed,salesperson employee card on a blank desk unit manager card on a desk full of reciepts district manager card on a fucking corinthian leather armchair nice
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,til everyone on reddit works for waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,oh shit we all got caught on reddit
IAmA,not_removed,its managers all the way down
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,well ok then
IAmA,not_removed,i no longer disapprove of you eating there for free on your days off
IAmA,not_removed,wtf thats bullshit and hardly seems legal
IAmA,not_removed,waffle house here i come thanx
IAmA,not_removed,id love to see this dick did you take a picture
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldve gotten away with it to if it wasnt for you middling redditors
IAmA,not_removed,the waffle house i frequent is just a little different when i pull in the cook gets out of the driver seat of the only other car in the lot and the waitress gets out of the passenger seat wipes her mouth and straightens her hair and shirt i feel bad for interrupting but im also usually really fucking hungry
IAmA,not_removed,okay it comes with an increase in responsibility but reduction in pay its a good opportunity for you
IAmA,not_removed,he just wants you to return the favor
IAmA,not_removed,if anyone wants to impress a waffle house waitress
IAmA,not_removed,rip your inbox
IAmA,not_removed,thing fnurr
IAmA,not_removed,hey baby i appreciate your value to society as a food service worker
IAmA,not_removed,no no no no i dont think you understand how many sides does one waffle have like physically not to eat
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely after being in that environment for years some of us are also a bit deaf
IAmA,not_removed,sober waffle house meals make you wonder what youve done with your life
IAmA,not_removed,its not margarine its lomelt aka grill shortening
IAmA,not_removed,two punk ass kids drove up next to this old man who collected cans on his bicycle and beat the shit out of him cook and the other waitress ran out and chased them off while i dialed
IAmA,not_removed,are you serious jake
IAmA,not_removed,god im scared the stories ive already told are way too specific
IAmA,not_removed,the cooks sweep and clean the parking lot around shift change so when they puke on the pavement thats their job if they puke in the resturant thats ours
IAmA,not_removed,regular ham and cheese sandwich only thing special is that its cooked in the waffle iron
IAmA,not_removed,a flat waffle lol
IAmA,not_removed,because its waffle house not ihop apparently edit i do not deserve this much karma christ
IAmA,not_removed,apart from day every leap year
IAmA,not_removed,allow me to introduce you to the wattafco waffle eggs your choice hashbrowns all the way topped with syrup and hot sauce all stacked waffle eggs browns
IAmA,not_removed,with one its not unusual inbetween
IAmA,not_removed,we used to do that in high school as well about a year ago i was a witness to what the staff does after they realize what you did they unplug the machine and it resets
IAmA,not_removed,why would you eat your grits any place else is definitely the top song
IAmA,not_removed,yup had friends who were power lifters and would regularly order scrambled eggs and a few grilled chicken breasts apparently its about the same price as buying and cooking them yourself
IAmA,not_removed,what youre on reddit and not already on the toilet
IAmA,not_removed,what you heard was give me alot of bacon and eggs what i said was give me all the bacon and eggs you have
IAmA,not_removed,honestly id take a to do the stupid penguinwaddle like dance i already do that my coworkers laugh at
IAmA,not_removed,i worked at a themed diner similar to johnny rockets whenever tequila came on we had to dance except i was a foutaineer the guy who made all the shakes and desserts up front i had nowhere to hide ever
IAmA,not_removed,is that what you should do i was constantly throwing away sketch bags and paraphernalia to the trash working a graveyard gas station shift last one was a guy coming back in frantically scanning the floors i asked if hed lost anything and if i could help he said i think i dropped some money i went ahead and started looking with him shortly after he said no worries it wasnt much and left about an hour later sweeping i found a wadded up plastic bag with tape all over it i started to unravel it thinking it might be something other than drugs but nope a lot of meth i chucked it into the coffee bar trash but later thought what if someone spotted it there i dont think it was the best idea but our dumpsters were for at least a time a goldmine for broke addicts
IAmA,not_removed,thats the reason odeon cinemas in the uk or at least the one i worked at many moons ago have blue lighting in the bathrooms harder to find a vein
IAmA,not_removed,sounds like they left a tip if you ask me
IAmA,not_removed,true story my futurewife and i met at a waffle house at am it was the only time in my life ive been to a waffle house let alone at am
IAmA,not_removed,yeah its more like the trucker who ran out of meth hours ago working on his coffee
IAmA,not_removed,this man gets it
IAmA,not_removed,this works almost anywhere i ate at burger king a lot in college at one point i was ordering the dollar fries dollar cheeseburger and a pc chicken nuggets just go home and drink water my roommate walked in with me once to a crazy line probably the longest i ever saw there like seconds later they call me over and hand me food despite the long line they said theyll ring me up next time my roommate is just like the fuck did you get they couldnt believe i got my order in like seconds in that rush got the order right and it was specific and yes i reminded them to ring me up twice the next day thats what you get for being a friendly regular imagine if youre a friendly regular who tips edit wrong your
IAmA,not_removed,yep mustard pack is used to mark country ham waffle house manager
IAmA,not_removed,working as a line cook i would like to disagree that is not amazing my head hurts just thinking about having to make food based on that system
IAmA,not_removed,correct assumption
IAmA,not_removed,and right you are
IAmA,not_removed,the vacuum repair guy was pretty great edit it was almost years ago
IAmA,not_removed,sup cousin
IAmA,not_removed,i guess ours are different we only sell mugs forreal where it goes to the company is around christmas time when they have the limited edition ones
IAmA,not_removed,apparently httpwwwpopscicomarticlesciencehowwafflehousebecamedisasterindicatorfema
IAmA,not_removed,yep they are a well run company that took the time to put together menus for disaster mode normal operations menu menu for no power menu for no water everything is fucked menu
IAmA,not_removed,i also want to marry op any interest in fighting this out at a local waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,for some reason i absolutely cannot read that without pronouncing it as creepy teepee even though i know perfectly well how crêpe is pronounced
IAmA,not_removed,god help us all
IAmA,not_removed,nations compare actual currency value on something called the big mac index
IAmA,not_removed,the best waffle houses are the ones where you pull up and the cook is smoking cigarettes out front
IAmA,not_removed,this had me giggling like a school girl
IAmA,not_removed,they laugh me off like usual hurts me to my very soul
IAmA,not_removed,alright dan

IAmA,not_removed,covington
IAmA,not_removed,can confirm you cant throw a stick in atlanta without it landing a mile from a waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget the hashbrowns
IAmA,not_removed,i think its because they are fucking tiny if one is packed go to the next one
IAmA,not_removed,you better fucking make sure its actually a melt you want
IAmA,not_removed,as long as you dont call it a grilled cheese
IAmA,not_removed,me neither and i wait on him
IAmA,not_removed,it is definitely amazing but go in with an open mind ive never been to a waffle house where i didnt feel the need to take a shower after visiting they are dirty grimy full of incredibly interesting people and absolutely delicious and cheap at least one employee is on probation drugs or stateaid its a place where everyone is served as equals its great and i highly recommend it
IAmA,not_removed,sober strippers are not uncommon bartenders routinely serve mocktails ie cocktails without alcohol to strippers when a customer buys them a drink source me i tended bar at a strip club for a while
IAmA,not_removed,because he is a unit manager
IAmA,not_removed,worst part is waking up to everyone eating dinner and you want breakfast then in the morning its the exact opposite fucks with your food timing hard also
IAmA,not_removed,why am i drinking beer at because fuck you thats why
IAmA,not_removed,agh i tried to hide it but the nametag date was off for whatever reason you dont have to believe me im just some internet asshole
IAmA,not_removed,i hope the ceo blacks out his name like its secret
IAmA,not_removed,that would complete me true story ive met waltceo several times down to earth guy
IAmA,not_removed,how about a slice of apple pie heated and treated
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about it to much waffle house got a shit ton of promotion out of this and you really didnt say anything damning about it from what i can tell and ive read almost every comment in here what a saturday the waffle house you work at sounds way better than a lot of the ones ive been to i wont be suprised at all when you make an update thread and find out you work for corporate in marketing or something
IAmA,not_removed,big fan of waffle house but why do you guys still not serve dr pepper
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,thats an awesome strategy im definitely using this at future career fairs in regards to the how my life would have turned out question thats a deep question but in short i can tell you its an outstanding company to work for through and through we work hard and we earn every dollar we get we work when others play and play when others work once you get past the oh man its waffle house part of it it really is a cool gig i always pictured myself as being the suit and tie kind of business man or owning my own business i never thought id make a career out of working at the waffle house just hit my year anniversary last week and i dont think ill ever change companies if you have any in depth questions about career opportunities id be happy to answer them just pm me
IAmA,not_removed,waffle house coupons are dangerous i was once mugged at gunpoint with my boyfriend we were stupid teenagers in the wrong place but obviously did not have much to mug upon finding our wallets empty they took his waffle house coupons he was pretty upset
IAmA,not_removed,thats quality
IAmA,not_removed,you aint the only one
IAmA,not_removed,dont get a server position at a waffle house go somewhere that sells alcohol and go somewhere busy
IAmA,not_removed,you just did a huge mistake
IAmA,not_removed,fuck oh damn baby youre getting extra cheese on your hashbrowns tonight

IAmA,not_removed,its gotta be the inside and the outside
IAmA,not_removed,fuck those kids

IAmA,not_removed,no hes
IAmA,not_removed,has a cook ever seen someone looking a little green and ran over and locked the door so they couldnt get out
IAmA,not_removed,im now disappointed i was imagining something like a mcgriddle mmm
IAmA,not_removed,europeans occasionally say textured pancake when ordering a waffle its pretty descriptive
IAmA,not_removed,im now imagining ihop sends spies to waffle house to make sure no ones cutting in their turf
IAmA,not_removed,yeah ill have the anal prolapse and a coffee black
IAmA,not_removed,whatd your toilet ever do to you
IAmA,not_removed,i used to work at waffle house and a regular would come in and order the following grilled cheesesteaks hold the texas toast triple hasbrowns all the way waffles he would use the waffles in place of the texas toast place the hasbrowns on top of the cheesesteak filling making one giant cheesesteak sandwich it was a wonderfully frightening display of ingenuity and gluttony
IAmA,not_removed,til one guy screams goddamnit pounds the table and leaves
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,hello from my toilet
IAmA,not_removed,sir thats a party platter meant to feed fifteen people i know what im about son
IAmA,not_removed,this is the best fucking ama
IAmA,not_removed,foutaineer is the most wonderfully terrible title i have ever heard
IAmA,not_removed,wow you actually read down into the comments of comments props to you for putting in the effort into this ama op very thorough
IAmA,not_removed,is this why i always get a packet of mayonnaise with my bacon egg and cheese texas toast sandwich it always seemed so out of place and of the hundreds of times ive never dared to try it figured i was doing breakfast wrong or something
IAmA,not_removed,tired as shit at making food for drunk people fuck is this the left side or right side of the plate technically fuck this shit they get whatever
IAmA,not_removed,huh where im from an oldfashioned is just a mixed drink
IAmA,not_removed,i thought that was a pretty fancy cocktail to mix in a wh parking lot but whatever
IAmA,not_removed,this could be a bestever followup ama
IAmA,not_removed,due to one lousy unfortunate incident in high school involving the girls locker room and some sweatpants ive been called creepy teepee on occasion
IAmA,not_removed,is that a thing every waffle house i went to had workers by the side of the building smoking
IAmA,not_removed,if there isnt at least cooks smoking cigs with visible tats when i pull up i just leave because i know its not the a squad
IAmA,not_removed,cigarettes
IAmA,not_removed,haha yes howd you know
IAmA,not_removed,why in the blue hell would anybody downvote this if you havent had waho hashbrowns all the way then you havent lived you havent lived edit we are all hashbrowns on this blessed day
IAmA,not_removed,oh hell yeah waffle then cheese then hamburger patty then cheese then hash browns then cheese then waffle all fried up like a patty melt should be that would be the ultimate waffle house thing
IAmA,not_removed,i was at a strip club about years ago and a dancer asked me to get her a drink she wanted a jack and coke and told me to tell the bartender it was for some type of spice or candy i was shy and didnt want the server to know that i was buying a drink for a dancer that was probably why when she took a sip she looked surprised
IAmA,not_removed,waffleshots fired
IAmA,not_removed,i grew up with a dad who worked nights thats just what i was used to didnt know anything was weird about it until i was asked to help with laying out the menus for a boy scout camping trip sure like they needed more reasons to think im weird incidentally this is one reason i like burger king over mcdonalds i dont care if you serve breakfast at night i want a burger in the morning
IAmA,not_removed,this is the most important part buying beer or doing anything at is down time someone calls you at fucking noon youd like to answer and say bitch what if i called you at midnight
IAmA,not_removed,ahhhh okay makes a little more sense but still good for you keep up the good work it probably says because when the manager orders the nametag it automatically puts the date as the year you were added to that particular units computer the manager has to manually change the date
IAmA,not_removed,i hope the ceo also wears a name tag
IAmA,not_removed,lmao
IAmA,not_removed,dude i hope you let walt know that this is the best ama ever and that im going to go to waffle house for breakfast tomorrow morning just because of this
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,agreed im reading this one the way home from a brazilian steakhouse dinner and even though im stuffed im already planning a visit to waffle house thanks to this ama
IAmA,not_removed,unotamanager just managed that like upvotes comments and a lot only read this without upvotingcommenting people are reading about waffle house i am from germany and i have no idea what waffle house even is i guess that is worth a promotion p
IAmA,not_removed,because of the exclusive deal with coke theyre both atlantabased companies and coke products are ubiquitous down here
IAmA,not_removed,ohmyjpg also why arent there any in california or nevada
IAmA,not_removed,this is the entire reason why its always rattled around my head the guy was so enthusiastic so happy for himself and others seemed genuinely interested in other people having a good life and such a strong advocate for waffle house he even went through the same motions of oh my god its waffle house everyone ive met who dedicated himselfherself to waffle house seems really happy with that decision in the long run
IAmA,not_removed,huh after college i went into software became a project manager traveled the country first then the world going to customer sites and doing deployments and consulting gigs for days at a time its exactly what i pictured when i was young being a cool business traveler i thought it would be neat to be able to say oh sorry i cant im in paris next week i was more miserable than i could have ever imagined now i do a much more blue collar job and im much happier and im thinking damn maybe i should go work for waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,i second this if i legally could sell alcohol i would i make pretty decent money for not being able to though so i cant complain
IAmA,not_removed,i have to be honest ive never been to a waffle house before i guess now i need to see if there are any in my area edit closest waffle house is miles away in another state rip extra cheese
IAmA,not_removed,i hope that old mans homies go and beat the shit out of those kids
IAmA,not_removed,but somehow textured pancake house doesnt have the same ring to it as waffle house
IAmA,not_removed,but ihop makes waffles so whos treading on whos turf
IAmA,not_removed,cant you see im talkin white
IAmA,not_removed,i also have seen that special can i be included
IAmA,not_removed,stop you had me at meat tornado
IAmA,not_removed,excuse me theres been some kind of mistake you gave me the food that my food eats
IAmA,not_removed,unotamanager for president
IAmA,not_removed,you should try it though mayo is amazing on breakfast sandwiches
IAmA,not_removed,i wondered why and how a waffle house was serving him a cocktail in their parking lot
IAmA,not_removed,creepy teepee is the funniest phrase ive heard all day
IAmA,not_removed,minutes outside of atlanta no starbucks you werent living on the north side bars you probably werent living on the douglasville west side im on reddit odds are youre white so you werent living on the south side that leaves east
IAmA,not_removed,that comes with a side of cardiologist
IAmA,not_removed,first responders report area as delicious
IAmA,not_removed,this is one reason i like burger king over mcdonalds another night shift veteran here arriving at a mcds after the end of my shift only to find theyre serving breakfast made me irrationally angry ive just finished work i want dinner
IAmA,not_removed,yeah that makes a lot of sense since my hr got it also i love your username
IAmA,not_removed,we need an ama from this guy hes got strategic insight and is clearly an ambassador
IAmA,not_removed,he does walt ehmer as does everyone at the company
IAmA,not_removed,sam waltons name tag gets escorted by security when they drag it out for meetings and shit
IAmA,not_removed,they do when in the field source used to be a division manager have met bert and joe rogers jr multiple times
IAmA,not_removed,i would if i was
IAmA,not_removed,😘
IAmA,not_removed,agreed this thread is without a doubt making me go to waffle house within the next days
IAmA,not_removed,for you and uzsnajorrah waffle house is a hour diner style restaurant that is primarily found in the southern us its honestly the best late night eatery you can hope for after a night of drinking or even on christmas morning if you have nowhere else to go
IAmA,not_removed,dutch guy here never heard of the chain either pretty good and funny ama though next time i visit the us ill be sure to look up a waffle house i will have to try that double chocolate chip waffle some day is there a waffle house in new york or in chicago
IAmA,not_removed,we are concentrated in the southeast region wh was founded in atl so thats where theyre concentrated most densely we are close to opening unit the company is growing exponentially and the sky is the limit really there will be over store in just a few short years and over not long after that i know we go out as far as arizona im sure there will be plenty more coming your way fun fact there are over waffle houses just inside the atlanta city limits alone fun fact they converted the original waffle house into a museum
IAmA,not_removed,you are throwing away money if you dont make the trip for the extra cheese
IAmA,not_removed,but i do like international house of nontextured waffles
IAmA,not_removed,after the recently built ihop was partially consumed by a sinkhole here my friends and i joked that the waffle mafia from the wh in town did them in
IAmA,not_removed,ahhhh that movie im watching that tonight
IAmA,not_removed,only if you put other random mulaney quotes here also excuse me im homeless im gay i have aids and im new in town
IAmA,not_removed,unotamanager for manager
IAmA,not_removed,youve never sat in your car making mixed drinks before going and getting a waffle you sir are clearly not from wisconsin
IAmA,not_removed,this is some sherlock level analysis
IAmA,not_removed,this ama is bringing out the best in reddit fucking amazing
IAmA,not_removed,im definitely considering it how does that work do i just drop in with a random ama im not a celebrity so i would think so
IAmA,not_removed,please tell me that youre so into waffle house that you knew his name off the top of your head without having to look it up
IAmA,not_removed,i could be wrong but i think everyone at wh has to work in a restaurant at least once a year or something
IAmA,not_removed,i love joe jr he visited my store while we were slammed and i was the only server there everyone left and shift hadnt shown yet he immediately stared bussing tables helping me with dishes and helped the cook he was just plain impressive with how kind he was he made my day
IAmA,not_removed,httpimgurcomtfshwbt
IAmA,not_removed,brit here taking a family of to the states next week we are going for some fucking waffles
IAmA,not_removed,these people are all haters waffle house franchises are found throughout the southeastern us it started in atlanta and youll find them from florida to texas to virginia and as far into the midwest as indiana though theyre not in new york or chicago its a dinerstyle restaurant open so very popular for drunken late night meals but is a solid breakfastbrunch option overall i recommend eggs bacon w hash browns scattered smothered covered and of course a classic waffle
IAmA,not_removed,please do an ama
IAmA,not_removed,what are other things about him
IAmA,not_removed,elementary my dear watson
IAmA,not_removed,the waffle house fan community is one of the more rabid fanbases on the internet over in rwafflehouse they do all sorts of weird shit like tracking delivery trucks overanalysis of released media to find any hint of future operations cfd simulations of syruppouring facility tour requests debates about the economics of jampacket reuse etc and at the heart of all of it is a cult of personality built around walt ehmer one of their mods allegedly gets faxes from walt about the goingson of waffle house but hell deny it if you ask
IAmA,not_removed,they do
IAmA,not_removed,imagine if someone got annoyed at him and asked to speak to his manager just whip out his name tag and watch their faces
IAmA,not_removed,you always have to respect a boss that can work
IAmA,not_removed,youre such a redditor
IAmA,not_removed,they go at least as far north as delaware
IAmA,not_removed,will do probably tomorrow
IAmA,not_removed,is this satire
IAmA,not_removed,i am actively choosing to believe this is all true
IAmA,not_removed,that would be hilarious ive actually seen it happen with a higher up hes called a coach but hes higher up than the division manager who is also a great guy they demanded to have the number for corporate and when they called he said hed have a long talk with him it was hilarious to watch in all honesty
IAmA,not_removed,most definitely ive only met him a couple times but i can say from my experiences he is most certainly a great guy and a hard worker and i am happy to work for him the same can be said about a lot of upper management theyll pop in randomly help us with dishes bussing and cooking the moment they come in they are ready to get to work a lot of companies when the higher ups come in employees get nervous at my waffle house we get excited to see them
IAmA,not_removed,arent we all
IAmA,not_removed,i hope not
IAmA,not_removed,how is your day going
IAmA,not_removed,how do we know you are who you say you are

IAmA,not_removed,strictly abiding by the rules nothing nsfw plz
IAmA,not_removed,hello there ive been diagnosed as atypical kleinelevin syndrome and have lived with this for years so ill do my best to answer your questions couldnt possible answer this as i dont really remember too much while in an episode other than being extremely tired and hungry i dont remember dreaming so i would have to say no i personally do not if my episode is really bad someone is usually around to help me such as my family they keep an eye on me and if they see ive been sleeping for hours they will usually force me to eat something there has been times when my family has not been around and instead friends had to look after me they obviously didnt know too much about kls but figured they would try to get me to eat and if they did not see me eat after a certain period of time weight loss and gains are a big issue my kls usually lasts daysweeks but seem to be more frequent compared to the usual month episodes you hear about everyone has it different it does feel extremely strange when someone says how are you doing its been a week since we last spoke and yet it only felt like yesterday to me but other than that not really i dont really have the time to catch up with the world im always lagging behind most other people i have spoken to with kls the sleep patterns usually return to normal after a day or for me personally the hypersomnia persists but at a lessened rate and my sleep patterns are very screwed when im not in an episode i do dream and have tried lucid dreaming successfully however considering youd have to remember dreaming or be in a dream to attempt this its kind of impossible since i dont usually remember anything while in an episode dreams included hope this is helpful

IAmA,not_removed,so now your saying that definitely social media manipulators and russia had to do with trumps win
IAmA,not_removed,russia had nothing to do with trump winning stop
IAmA,not_removed,ive definitely seen articles where theyve been interviewed before sometimes your conscience gets to you others have been interviewed anonymously i guess that doesnt work too well for an ama though
IAmA,not_removed,sees that you frequent td realizes that your comment makes that obvious leaves

IAmA,not_removed,putin and the russian federation over a dozen intelligence services have confirmed that the wikileaks cases have been illegally hacked from their targets by a russian hacking group sponsored by the kremlin putin himself has had multiple critical journalists and politicians either suffer a bad accident or outright murdered president putin has also cracked down on civil rights including freedom of speech and lgbtqi rights there has also been evidence that he has maintained a strong online presence and has spawned multiple farright parties to destablise geopolitical rivals he has also been involved in aiding the assad government in airstrikes in syria targeting civillians and choosing to use a doubletap method by bombing one location before waiting until organisations such as the white helmets come to rescue any survivors before launching a second strike in the same location to kill anyone else remaining this also goes on top of the actions of russianrussianbacked forces destabalizing the legitimate government of the ukraine through special forces militia support and military equipment this is also not mentioning his bold moves in regards to the baltics and other methods in testing the european powers so how would you face off the russian federation whether in support of our mutual european allies or without would you condemn the actions of the putin government in its human right record as well as the actions of russianaffiliated hackers dumping stolen and hacked documents on wikileaks the refugee crisis since the migrant crisis has become one of the biggest issues in mainland europe with germany alone taking care of million people france had recently begun in calais to remove its largest migrant camp this issue has threaten to strain relations with our european bretheren including the hungary bulgaria and other nations it has also created a multitude of antimigrant and particularly antimuslim organisations some far more violent than others as president what would you do to combat this issue africa east and central africa while having some of the richest collection of resources also happen to hold one of the worst standards for both education and infrastructutre anywhere in the world would you be looking forward to give humanitarian aid for nations to develop these sectors building their economy stabilizing their government and encourage them to become better economic partners with the northeastern part of nigeria constantly plagued with the terrorist faction boko haram which abducted more than schoolgirls with much of their whereabouts unknown how would you stablize the region support female education and contain the insurgent group west and central africa disease and aid recently with the nations such as mali and sierra leone suffering the recent ebola crisis and their lack of available infrastructure such as roads and medical facilities as well as a general lack of education meaning that people still hold superstitious belief in regards to lifesaving prevention and medical treatment and aid how would you as leader of the free world urge impoverished nations to deliver education and to build up their healthcare capabilities and infrastructure european union brexit since the june vote earlier this year the united kingdom has opted to start the paperwork for leaving the european union within months this financial issue has weakened the pound and has threatened the integrity and the survivability of this singlemarket trading bloc as a president of a nation closeley aligned with the european union what would you do to defuse the rise of the rightwing nationalists while maintaining a comprehensive national security policy the drug crisis with over people in the states dying of opiod overdose alone how would you raise awareness of drugs whether overthecounter prescription or illicit narcotics such as cocaine and methaphetamine firearms of historical or sentimental value what is the stein platform in regards to firearms particularly to historical and recreational firearms such as family heirlooms and those that have been involved in conflicts such as the garand the carbine the the and others which have a history of being in a nations or a historical figures service
IAmA,not_removed,entrepreneurship and startups as a child i believed that when i grow up i would become a armaments designer or a military engineering organisation in the vein of the springfield armory or reihnmetall lockheed martin and other companies of the type aiding the united states develop equipment so that its enemies back down whilst also dabbling in my hobby of engineering firearms and military equipmentvehicles do you have any words for anyone looking to start up a big business company or other major industrial bases after the shootings of both police officers and africanamerican citizens how would you make sure that african americans can be safe from extrajudical lawenforcement tactics systemic policies skewing heavily on them and a distrust in the wider community without negating the capabilities of the police and preventing them from harm both in terms of equipment and in the aims of combating organised crime how would a clinton government approach the united nations in regards to its position in the united nations security council in passing resolutions and programs such as the peacekeeperss the world health organisation among other organisations if you do obtain a position within the united states government will you be able to negotiate and work across the aisle in regards to resolving legislation this will include compromising over principles at times so that progress could be made note that if you win the presidency the republican party would bunker down into a stalemate for as long as it is possible
IAmA,not_removed,afghanistan will you be continuing the current administration in aiding afghan national army forces in training and peacekeeping roles in the hopes that it woukld produce a bettertrained afghan military aligned with the united states and a more stable country repairing its infrastructure and economy or will you take an alternate path iran this nation has reached a deal in that is will suspend any operations in regards to any offensive nuclear arms capability in exchange of lifting embargoes however iran has been accused of funding or sponsoring the acts of organisations such as hamas and hezbollah how would you ensure that the irans offensive nuclear proliferation remain stalled while denying them the ability to conduct acts through proxy groups the state of israel israel for as long as it has been established has been at tensions within the palestinian community this involves extremist palestinians committing suicide attacks on idf troopers and border guards as well as launching rockets and other acts of violence while the israeli government has kept silent on extrajudicial killings and expansion of territories without paying due compensation how can you reconcile these two ethnic and religious groups will you recognise palestine as a territory and what will you do in regards to israel as a whole in terms of national security as they have the formidable mossad and is a gateway to the middle east as well as sharing our values the yemenarabian conflict recently the shia houthi rebels had launched antiship missiles against united states naval vessels patrolling and performing maritime security alongside the major trade routes of the red sea however the wahhabi saudi government in which the united states has what is described as a special relationship with has had strained relationships due to its human rights record concerns of backing forces in syria more aligned in fighting assad then daesh and its position on israel this is offset by the fact that the nation has invested major assets towards american businesses boosting the economy its goal of containing iran as a destabilizing power in the middle east and its strategic location in the persian gulf and the red sea especially as that is where transport ships go theough the suez canal rather than going around africa how would you maintain order amongst the arabic peninsula whether by economic political or military force and how would you manage the security of the red sea the syrian civil war syria has been a major humanitarian catastrophe with people migrating towards europe and safer nations at a scale not seen since the end of the second world war on one side is the putinbacked assad government which has been making grounds in several fronts however they ave been accused of multiple war crimes including using barrelbombs chemical weapons such as chlorine and sarin and indiscriminatly targeting civilian populations more often then those of daesh this also include british humanitarian services churches hospitals and united nationsaffiliated buildings and organisations would you be aiding the forces in syria such as the secretarian syrian free army and bring a quick end to the war or would you rather not get involved and hope that these organisations militias and other groups would dismantle in time no matter how long it takes secondly you have mentioned that you would defeat daesh without a single bullet or loss of life you have said that by this you have meant a complete arms embargo from all nations supplying it and freezing all accounts tied to its financial support after this you have claimed that you would stop the iraqis from buying the refined oil that daesh has manufactured however even without new firearms or a consistant cashflow you are still talking about ideologically extreme people in one of the most dangerous combat zones in the world fanatically under one banner do you have any plans for their group to weaken their membership knowing that such organisations in the past such as the taliban and alqaeda have shown that even without rifles they would create bombs this is also coupled by the social media capabilities of daesh radicallizing people throughout the world would you attempt to eliminate their media presence

IAmA,not_removed,i really like it its also fastpaced but far more social than the us which i think sometimes puts too much pride into its differences than its similarities it reminds me of growing up in nj the to a great degree people are more social and accepting in many waysperhaps not as much as it was when i got here but theres a true liberal spirit that guides the country the memory of oppression in runs deep i also just saw a statistic that meaning from a different background than the netherlands when you add in the people living together which is an acceptable practice as out of families with children live together without being married the number rises to i think this adds into why the dutch are good at making sure we all feel part of the same whole its not simple you really need to be functional if not fluent in the language and its not ideal we foreigners are often told youll never be dutch or if youre not dutch youre not much nationalism exists everywhere and some traditions can cause rifts between races like httpsenwikipediaorgwikizwartepiet dont get me started on that but we do generally try to live together in peace as far as language goes i have albeit it poorly the dutch make it easy for me to be too damn lazy about speaking it instead of english its essential i believe to speak the language if even at a functional level im in it so its easy to navigate in english but when i have a plumber or heater repair person in for instance of the time its dutchonly so you have to try
IAmA,not_removed,thats an interesting statistic thanks for sharing that with me yeah heshe piet reminds me of jim crow but i guess every society has problems and no wheres perfect youre actually the second person i know of whos moved to the netherlands and is very happy i should visit the place some time to see for myself
IAmA,not_removed,like anyone moving to a new place there are multiple stages youll go through my god ive moved its all so new i miss my old ways lets give their way a try these stupid goddam people why do they do xyz this way meh there are lots of ways to do itnothings truly the right way so be prepared to give it years otherwise youll just be another expat who comes and goesand thats a big issue cool places like the netherlands see a lot of expats but very few stay of the dozens ive known over the past years a handful are still here normally its because they now have family and this is a really great place to raise children but that wanderlust also means theres no reason for dutch people to be your friend youll try but more often than not youll hear things like i have enough friends or my friends stay and youll be gone in yearswhich is generally true most dutch dont move far from their home and still know most of the people they went to high school or college with youre a blip in their timestream until youve been here a decade or more and then perhaps youll get grandparented in but youll never be dutch the word is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiallochtoon every country has rednecks
IAmA,not_removed,hi powdercum your post has been removed because we ask that when requesting public figures users include some public way of contacting the person requested if you want you can edit the post with this information and reply to this comment and i will reapprove your request please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,not_removed,is this better i dont know any other source than the one added
IAmA,not_removed,happy to provide any proof i can to the mod team
IAmA,not_removed,how does the model distinguish between comments that are toxic vs comments that might be sarcastic also moderating forums for toxicity might also trigger the debate of right to freedom of speech what is your take on that finally how does the model distinguish between trolls vs genuine toxic comments
IAmA,not_removed,is it being used on googles own properties like youtube comments
IAmA,not_removed,after the microsoft tay disaster how do you ensure your generated conversations are natural enough to not seem like a canned robot response yet smart enough to understand hitler did nothing wrong isnt appropriate are the comments manually reviewed somewhere or is it a learning algorithm that scores comments and mannerisms via watching users reactions after trying them if i recall thats how tay worked and decided to make it think being a racist asshole was optimal lastly how far off do you feel we are from a chatbot passing the turing test
IAmA,not_removed,interesting product thanks for the ama your tool seems to be focusing on the behavior of lone wolf trolls but in my experience contemporary trolling is characterized largely by brigading behaviors where an external special interest community will rally its supporters to infiltrate an opposing interest community either to suppress views they disagree with or to attempt to normalize views they support from how youve described your product it seems that you are planning to score comments based on their text alone do you have any plans to incorporate network attributes or attempt any kind of user profiling there are certain online spaces that are dominated by what you would likely characterize as toxic comments such as the comment threads attached to news articles on farright media outlets or the comments associated with basically any youtube video do you think theres any hope for a tool like this affecting the tone of the discussion when you could effectively just classify every comment in the space as toxic without even looking at the text
IAmA,not_removed,excuse my potential ignorance but this feels like part of this new theme of calling things machine learning without having much to do with machine learning you appear to describe some pretty standard statistical analysis of text with some weighting bias this has been done for decades at this point and the false positives are huge where is the machine learning in your approach and how is it actually helping
IAmA,not_removed,on a personal level what are a few of your favorite films
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think is the biggest weakness in your system when it comes to moderating online discussions
IAmA,not_removed,what was the original impetus behind this product and what is your vision for it also as a young engineer what types of things should i be doing to build a resume to work somewhere like jigsaw
IAmA,not_removed,whats the coolest part about working at jigsaw
IAmA,not_removed,how could machine learning take part and help in aerospace industry
IAmA,not_removed,if you could have your ai moderate conversations offline would you
IAmA,not_removed,hello as a software engineering student ive been quite interested in machine learning for a few years now under the hood does perspective use or a similar implementation of word vectorization also how are you approaching the problem of context and sarcasm are you feeding raw textual data into a manylayered neural net and getting a score out like deepmind has done with wavenet or are you doing some sort of preprocessing on the toxic nontoxic comments thanks
IAmA,not_removed,does one necessarily to be an engineer to work for jigsaw im very interested in the work that jigsaw does but im majoring in philosophy do you have any advice for me please
IAmA,not_removed,is it worth it to have a premium membership to brazzers
IAmA,not_removed,do you agree that it should be mandatory for platform owners to inform their users that censorship tools like perspective are being used
IAmA,not_removed,great question there definitely will be false positives as you pointed out and they exist because the patterns in these examples are similar to patterns found in toxic comments theres a couple of helpful clarifications to make here also one is that the rating is not how toxic something is but rather how similar this is to comments other people said were toxic so it is a binary classification giving a probability not a severity measure if the model has seen lots of examples of you are a stupid idiot and i want to kill you being marked as toxic then they could both get scores also sometimes what someone says can be offensive but we are explicitly trying to score how something is said not what is said
IAmA,not_removed,great question
IAmA,not_removed,does have meaning im not aware of
IAmA,not_removed,sarcasm is a fascinating and complex characteristic of language that is difficult for machines to detect and often people too we train our models by having human raters review comments if the raters can identify sarcasm and would score the comment differently then the machine will identify patterns of language associated with the sarcasm id actually really like to train models on sarcasm but to do that we need a much larger dataset of sarcastic comments and probably the context in which they occur even for toxicity we have much less training data that wed like this means the machine learning algorithm get things wrong much more often than wed like because of this we dont think perspective should not yet be used for fully automatic moderation of comments it is not clear if it will ever be possible to get the error rate down to make automatic moderation of comments a good idea what we think is really exciting is the ability to make new kinds of user experiences that help people have better conversations online eg for writing and sorting comments more generally we are building perspective to help allow people to discuss difficult topics without accidentally or intentionally shouting each other out of the conversation at the moment its really difficult to have a productive conversation and keep people in the conversation this means that platforms and publishers are turning off comments altogether if we can help people keep the comments on and help people have better discussions about their disagreements i think that will help free speech
IAmA,not_removed,by releasing perspective as a developer api people can use it where they want to if they think that it would help their community and it is totally up to them how it would be applied some ways we are thinking it might be useful are to give readers a new way of sorting through what they want to read or to give people a bit of feedback as they type or make mods jobs easier by giving them a shorter list of things they have to review if a community doesnt care about toxicity but cares about other attributes like how ontopic something is we hope to have models for that in the coming months too
IAmA,not_removed,youtube has their own team working on making comments better and they recently released a new set of commenting features to put control in the hands of creators to set the tone on their channels we think it makes a lot of sense to put power in the hands of creators and the people who are hosting conversations and are trying to make that type of capability available to people on other platforms too
IAmA,not_removed,tay was actually a very different kind of system we are doing something much simpler just text classification having said that how ml models are gamed is very much part of our research and we dont blindly trust ratings people send us instead we have additional people rate corrections that are provided longer term the more people try to game the our system the more robust we can make these kinds of models so were pretty happy to have the challenge
IAmA,not_removed,la la landoh nowaitmoonlight
IAmA,not_removed,limited training data means the machine learning algorithm will get things wrong limited data also means the algorithms learns shallow associations because of this perspective should not be used for fully automatic moderation of comments the api and demo do provide a way to send us feedback so we hope use of that will enable our machine learning to make significant improvements
IAmA,not_removed,the challenge of wanting better ways to have good discussion on complex issues with a wide variety of people is what motivates me i love understanding new arguments and ideas i wish we could do that more in online conversations we started by meeting with people who were targeted by online harassment and realizing that they were currently facing a choice of either going offline or reading every awful thing hurled their way as we worked on the issue more we realized that the dynamic of toxic discussions also meant that people were increasingly ending up only talking to people they already agreed with the hope is that this will let folks stay online when they are facing abuse and help everyone venture into debates with people they disagree with without having to get digitally punched in the face to build up a resume i suggest playing with tensorflow do some of the tutorials play with apis and make fun prototypes work with friends and come up with ideas that will both push your technical skills as well as help showcase your ideas
IAmA,not_removed,it sounds corny but id have to say the people both folks on the team and the target users of our products who often are often attacked for their beliefs or their views but believe in their cause so much that they risk their wellbeing or safety to be heard people who have been through these experiences have brilliant insights and we get to spend the day talking to them and building tools to help make sure they arent silenced by ddos attacks or harassment campaigns or the fear that their accounts will be hacked or whatever else is being thrown their way
IAmA,not_removed,no idea i dont know anything about aerospace most of our work is in another type of cloud but if you throw out a couple of big challenges wed be happy to take a guess
IAmA,not_removed,when im feeling frustrated or overly enthusiastic in a discussion i would love to have something that could give me a hint about how im coming across offline and online warn me that im about to say something ill regret and remind me to consider if thats really what i want to say it would be even cooler if it could give me some suggested options about different ways to phrase things too
IAmA,not_removed,yes we use wordvectors fed into a deep cnn for some of our models we do some standard preprocessing too if you want to build your own theres a great tutorial on that here and weve released public data sets you can use also here we largely ignore sarcasm we send our comments to people to rate and let them make the interpretation with regard to context initially we thought this would be a huge problem but it turns out that for characteristics of language like toxicity although its easy to construct examples that depend on context it is not actually important for the vast majority of cases an important exception is when you move to different attributes of language for example to make a decision about how ontopic a comment is you clearly need to know the topic in question our api has a field for context and were working on models for things like offtopic that would make better use of it wed love to hear from people working on this see our research page httpsconversationaigithubio
IAmA,not_removed,major in what drives your curiosity i majored in philosophy too
IAmA,not_removed,id challenge the premise here if you check out our github page we make it clear that this should not be used to automatically remove comments from a discussion as it currently makes too many mistakes many of the applications we suggest like letting readers sort comments and giving feedback to authors automatically inform users by virtue of the interaction if a publisher chooses to also use this to help flag comments for human review which wouldnt be immediately obvious to a user then i think it would be ideal to share this process with users but it is really up to the website owner and the community
IAmA,not_removed,so given that youre using a heuristic that is effectively the same as spam flagging feedback spam filter engines work by flagging mail similar to what the users have flagged as spam previously — what differentiates your product from someone simply retraining a spam filter engine to call a comment toxic rather than spam please feel free to be as technical as youd like
IAmA,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifourteenwords
IAmA,not_removed,i lold
IAmA,not_removed,can we turn machine learning into jarvis like it can help finding a root of complicate problem from data given and can help us organized a lot of data we produce everyday
IAmA,not_removed,that seems a resonable answer if you dont mind i have another question would this technolagy be something the usure could turn on and of as preference or be mandatory
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,we make it clear that this should not be used to automatically remove comments from a discussion follow up question dont you think that ultimately the tool will be used for exactly that to delete hide or downgrade comments that are considered toxic why use human moderators if you can replace them with a software
IAmA,not_removed,you are quite right that spam detection can also be treated as a machine learning classification problem and one of the signals used for spamdetection is the textual content of the message so that part is similar but there are a couple of notable differences also spam filtering also uses a bunch of nontextual signals such as whether the email has a spoofed from address we want to help provide perspectives on how people are writing not on who they are for that we end up with a quite different annotation and labelling challenges we are trying to understand the emotional impact of language and help machines help us understand it we are also interested in what part of the text is a perspective relevant to eg which part is toxic which part is obscene this enables new kinds of ux to be developed being able to provide feedback to people related to parts of the text is something quite different to an overall classification so at this point the problems look quite different finally we are not interested in automated filtering which is what spam typically does instead were interested in helping developers publishers and researchers figure out new ways to have online conversations so if theres some new kind of machine learning to support a different way to show a perspective on a conversation well dive into that ideas are welcome
IAmA,not_removed,holy shit
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your response
IAmA,not_removed,maybe you should post this on rcasualiama
IAmA,not_removed,wow this is really interesting im going to bombard you with questions i hope theyre not too much how did you become involved in what you do how long did it take to become certified in everything what type of person excels in this line of work what are the most boring parts of your job the most exciting what are some things youre still learning or would like to learn thanks for your time
IAmA,not_removed,what the most gruesome or gutwrenching thing youve had to clean up please be as detailed as possible for the weak of stomach here
IAmA,not_removed,have any criminals ever asked you to dispose of anything for them
IAmA,not_removed,two part question do you still get grossed out by things or are you totally immune to all forms of nastiness something in our apartment stinks smells like unwashed dog but we dont have pets best guess
IAmA,not_removed,have you cleaned up any famous scenes anything celebrity related have any coworkers quit on the spot once they saw something they couldnt handle
IAmA,not_removed,have you watched spotless on netflix it seems similar to what you do
IAmA,not_removed,did you ever have to clean up any industrial chemical spillscontaminations what about crime scenes
IAmA,not_removed,three part i guess sorry what is the freshest body that you have dealt with how long since their death what is the greatest number of individuals at one crime scene you have come across lastly how long does an average job take im sure theres a whole range of times depending on the situation so i guess just whatever kind of scenario
IAmA,not_removed,interesting topic thank you i have a couple of questions for you have you ever found evidence the cops missed what do you do in that situation whats the strangest weirdest job youve had to deal with doesnt have to be a body anything that springs to mind any eerie or frightening experiences while on the job have you ever considered starting your own abracertified company specialising in body recoveries just so you can call it abracadaver
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever worked forwith the government on cleanup projects basically have you seen the aliens i should be sleeping
IAmA,not_removed,whats your educational background like
IAmA,not_removed,a portable toilet gets laid over due to the wind theres human feces and soiled paper wrapped up in rebar sitting on forms where they need to pour concrete what do
IAmA,not_removed,is this a field youve always found interesting what were you doing before this do you own youre own company work alone or work for someone what is the pay like thank you for your time
IAmA,not_removed,i recently had a water remediation in a small apartment building i own my insurance covered everything but lead pain and asbestos removal the remediation crew did things the right way but to the tune of over k now the building was built in at that time lead paint and asbestos were common place materials in your experience with buildings of that age have you ever known an insurance company to deny that part of the remediation coverage
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for taking the time to respond to everyone i have a two part question about fire clean up is trying to prevent mold part of a fire clean up from water used to put the fire out what products are the best for getting rid of odor specifically smoke
IAmA,not_removed,what is the weirdest thing you have had to clean up
IAmA,not_removed,a few questions here have you ever cleaned up after flooding or fire and whats the oldest cadaver you have ever dealt with
IAmA,not_removed,whats the oldest body youve had to deal with like how long was it there
IAmA,not_removed,what does an average work day look like for you
IAmA,not_removed,has there ever been a job so biohazardous that you had to turn it down hows your dating life and how do they react when you tell them what you do for a living
IAmA,not_removed,how did you get into this line of work
IAmA,not_removed,a lot of jobs you perform will naturally deal with insurance claims and an adjuster is there usually a lot of disagreement and negotiations with adjusters on the price of using the remediation equipment i ask because i work in property management and have had need of your industrys services multiple times for water damage and mold remediation a lot of times but the cost didnt meet the deductible for insurance or it wasnt worth filing a claim so i have to review the costs for and approve the remediation im usually surprised by the cost of drying and water extraction specifically with regard to the cost to rent the machines
IAmA,not_removed,how does someone enter this type of career
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever felt ill or had strange symptoms after encountering molds i once lived in a house with a terrible mold problem and had peripheral neuropathy for a month possibly completely unrelated of course still im curious to hear more about just how creepy mold is after black mold whats the next mosttoxic common mold
IAmA,not_removed,i know this is really late but ive read most of your responses and am intrigued i work in the bio world too in a lab most i ever see are miscarriages or aborted fetuses but my job is centered around finding out what went wrong either through blood stool or urine just curious if your job were to disappear a year from now what would you try to do to carry over your experiencecerts to another career path csi waste disposal i see you mostly work indoor jobs have you ever worked vehicle collisions if so how different is that cleanup job compared to indoor jobs im thinking about changing career paths and going back to college for forensics ever work with a forensics team if so how was it thanks for posting this most interesting ama in weeks
IAmA,not_removed,wow just found this so interesting so a very late question can you describe to me in detail the single grossest job youve been on also how often are maggots and insects present have you encountered many hoarders thanks for your time
IAmA,not_removed,do you think biofuels are worth investing in
IAmA,not_removed,i became involved after seeing a friend of mines paycheck from working here took years before i came onboard myself but its hard to find an opening here we are more career oriented than job oriented all the certifications i have now have taken years theres only so many opportunities to get a new certification and we need to spread the knowledge out amongst all the employees i would say people that are motivated and dedicated are minimum traits you need to be able to handle every type of person in every type of potential scenario not only do we do remediation we are also psychiatrists and social workers to some degree you see a wide range of emotions in this line of work if you cant handle someone at their very worst then you wont make it here remember we deal with people who just potentially had the most traumatic or devastating event happen to them ever in their lives and you need to be ready for that most boring filling out paperwork and theres lots of it most exciting going into a new house to see a new experience and meet another person that hopefully we can make feel happier and confident things are going to be ok ill never stop learning theres over certifications available to me most need one certain cert to go onto the next so theres a nice progression i still would like to learn how to run the business fully they might never teach me that though in fear of me becoming competition just kidding our owner likes competition how else do we better ourselves if theres no one to push us there
IAmA,not_removed,i feel like gruesome and gutwrenching are two different aspects of the job gutwrenching is a single father who did everything he could to support his daughter on her own only for her to feel unable to speak to him because he wasnt her mother and according to her note a father couldnt understand what she was going through simply because he was a man so she took her own life with her fathers gun or the two veterans i had to clean up this recent veterans day who only had neighbors that checked on them no friends no family just neighbors willing to die for our country but had nothing to live for outside of that thats gutwrenching to me gruesome though thats a different story i personally think shotgun to the head is about the most gruesome it gets these situations are difficult because a shotgun at point blank throws skull skin blood hair and brain pieces all over the place you clean everything up and think youre good to go when you decide to check behind the television and in the slots behind it theres quarter sized skull fragments lodged in there there is no math or logic to shotguns to the head basically you have to go up down in and out to find every piece of brain and skull i think thats worse than a semi healthy but loner middle aged person that slipped and fell in the shower and had been dead for two weeks before anyone noticed by that point depending on surrounding conditions the body is badly decomposed way past rigor mortis but yet somehow has slimy skin that seems like it had just melted off the body onto the floor in a pile of what looks like jello made of body
IAmA,not_removed,no not yet i did have a guy who insisted on showing us the gun his wife used to kill herself then took us down to his gun safe which was the size of two walkin closets he asked me and my helper if we wanted to walk in and check out the guns we fearfully declined
IAmA,not_removed,part my first blood and guts cleanup was rough not necessarily because it was a bad job it just was different from what i was used too i had just been certified and hadnt had a real job like that yet but after the first one you need to train yourself to keep your composure with biorecovery you tend to deal with families that are at a total loss in compete shock and are saddened the last thing you need is the technicians you hired to be needing to run outside to vomit part without being there i wont know exactly a couple things to look for one check your vents vacuum out as far as you can inside each one or better yet if you have access to a borescope use that and look inside them also check the hvac coils just in case two if theres any drywall thats been compromised where mice and other critters can get themselves trapped into your walls
IAmA,not_removed,unwashed dog sounds like fungal or possibly bacterial in nature based on my medical knowledge
IAmA,not_removed,question no no celebrities or famous scenes not on a large scale anyway ive seen my work uncredited in the paper though question i give all my employees a full run down of the wrost case scenarios and question them relentlessly to be sure they can handle it mentally the closest ever ive had to an employee quitting was a shotgun to the head job and he walked in without any gear on causing him to get a huge whiff of what a dead body smelt like and he just walked out down the street made a phone call got picked up and went back to the shop he didnt do another bio job again hes no longer employed but thats not the reason why
IAmA,not_removed,no but i will sunshine cleaning is the closest movie ive seen so far to what i do
IAmA,not_removed,what is spotless
IAmA,not_removed,a few chemical spills lots of crime scenes
IAmA,not_removed,question hours maybe most cases police or ambulance need to get involved so theres always going to be time before i arrive question only ever had one body at once no double homicides or anything like that yet question average job is about two hours
IAmA,not_removed,yes i have i had a job that i felt very certain that the way the exit hole was in relation to how tall the deceased was didnt add up the deceased was a very short woman who used a rifle and the exit hole in the drywall behind where she had done it was about feet high i didnt see how a woman couldve used a rifle to shoot herself straight on in the face i called up a friend of mine who was working towards being a detective and told him what was going on they stopped work while they did another investigation turns out she didnt do it her husband did and my friend got a promotion i thought this was big news but yet it never reached the papers or anything except that he was being charged for her murder turns out he was schizophrenic and felt that the mafia was after his wife so he shot her to protect her from them edit my cop friend got a promotion because of this i did a house once that a womens son had died and she kept his body there for as long as she could until her family came over and smelt it immediately and called us the mother was in complete shock for weeks didnt want anything touched or moved so we had to be sneaky about it for her safety we had to get everything out of there i did a water loss at an old hotel thats now been long abandoned theres only one person that lives there and he owns and maintains the entire place the place is huge well it was getting really late in the evening and started to snow so it was a perfect night for crazy things i saw someone in one of the rooms on the opposite side of the hallway they were leaning out of one of the room doors so i said excuse me and got no answer i went down to the door i saw the person leaning out of and nothing this was a dead end hallway and i checked every single room and checked them thoroughly nothing because of the snow my helper and i decided to get out of there before we got stuck there when i was taking my helper home he confessed to seeing the same thing on the same floor in the same area as me he also investigated and came up with nothing this blew our minds because the only guy that was there had long left for the night because he didnt want to be disturbed by our work im positive it was a ghost ill let you have that one
IAmA,not_removed,i wish
IAmA,not_removed,high school and some college
IAmA,not_removed,hose it down soil acts like a filter and sewage on the ground is normal
IAmA,not_removed,never thought of this field ever until the opportunity came i was building homes for years before doing this i work directly below the owner and have guys below me i make
IAmA,not_removed,i cant decipher your policy but no ive never seen them decline lead and asbestos remediation im also certified in both those so i will just do those things the right way and charge insurance for that remediation as a separate line item if it needs to be done as part of the remediation to get your home back to preloss or better condition it shouldve been covered most policies cover to the point of preloss or better for structurematerials but wont cover addons upgrades and the source of loss repair
IAmA,not_removed,if its a fire where the fire department came out and hosed it down then yes theres a mold concern the way we handle it is immediately treat it like a water loss once the structure is stabilized where mold cannot grow then work on the fire part fire losses should be thoroughly cleaned to ensure the odor goes away but some things cant be cleaned like that think insulation in an unfinished area and those areas need either an ozone which completely changing the molecules of the air by eliminating the odor causing molecule or by a thermal fogging which more so masks the smell
IAmA,not_removed,theres nothing thats really weird per se that i would clean up but i get a lot of customers claiming they dont know why their house stinks and why theres wet spots all over the house because their pets usually multiple cats have never had any accidents so they are certain thats not the source its the source
IAmA,not_removed,hair depends on decomposition if the bodies been there long enough that the skin starts to disconnect itself from your insides the hair typically slide off with it suicides in a tub full of water is when youll see large chunks of hair in there tub suicides are the wrost especially if they used hot water
IAmA,not_removed,ive done thousands of water and fire losses oldest corpse i believe months was my oldest that was a situation where a women lived alone and the mailman had found her
IAmA,not_removed,months mailman found her
IAmA,not_removed,average day get up take excedrin because this job tears your body apart get ready for work go into work early so that i can plan everyones day figure out where im going and what is prioritized assume what i need for those jobs and hope im right so when i get to the jobs i have everything i need go job to job either doing a loss or checking in on a loss my days are planned out ahead of leaving the shop for the day but you never know what youre walking into for each loss so dealing with customers that refuse to understand that is part of the job as well and this job is so you got to mentally prepare to be gone all day
IAmA,not_removed,we will never turn a job down sometimes though i wish we did some people are impossible to please and you usually know who they are the moment you speak to them im married and my wife understands what i do and that i could have to leave at any moment to work i got lucky shes amazing and supports my work habits and knows what i do helps people she doesnt like hearing the stories though because a lot of times its more sad than anything
IAmA,not_removed,a friend of mine showed me his paycheck and i immediately became interested it took years before a position finally opened up funny enough it was my friends job i took because he got fired but i got a call from the owner who ive never met at the time and he said hes heard a lot of good things about me and was wondering if i was interested in trying it out best call i ever got
IAmA,not_removed,usually for homeowners its worth the claim because yes we are very expensive a lot of businesses though have very high deductibles so they tend to pay out of pocket our company uses a computer program for our estimates that computer program is specific to our county as it is to every county in the country so price discrepancies arent common on a large scale they might say that we didnt need to set up a certain thing or use an antimicrobial but usually am explanation will take care of that
IAmA,not_removed,apply at a remediation company and be willing to work as many hours as possible and be proactive about them paying for classes make them want to want to to be certified
IAmA,not_removed,there are so many types of mold its impossible to tell which one is the next worse to black mold we treat all microbial growth as if its deadly we also wear proper ppe on every mold job so ive never had adverse affects while on a job i did stay in a rental home for vacation once and because im very familiar with the smell of mold noticed it right away and was sick all week we politely told the property manager who claimed it gets inspected between renters so they are certain there wasnt any
IAmA,not_removed,ill continue to answer every question that comes in i honestly do not know what i would move to with my certs and still use them id be interested in the other side of crime scene investigation but i believe i would need a lot more training before that would be an option in situations where theres a fatality in a vehicle theres likely no salvaging the vehicle and at least in my area we dont get brought out for that our county has its own cleanup for situations like that ive tried to promote our business to them since ive seen them doing cleanup and they dont protect themselves properly so far nothing has come of it for us in my line of work there is never a need to deal with the forensics team if you live in or near a large city with high homicide rates id say go for it its definitely an interesting field my sister started her post college career doing that but my area doesnt have a high demand for that
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,holy shit that sounds nasty
IAmA,not_removed,what
IAmA,not_removed,what did she use firearm wise
IAmA,not_removed,can you tell about them what was the most dangerous spill or the worst andor strangest crime scene
IAmA,not_removed,thats really fast
IAmA,not_removed,that gunshot catch sounds like a reallife episode of csi good on you although what a sad motive and had that been me in the hotel id still be running thanks for answering
IAmA,not_removed,i have actually had to tell people that they cannot return books that reek of cat pee your cat pees on it its yours forever or trash
IAmA,not_removed,how does water temp affect it i would think by the time anything major decomposition wise starts to go down that any water would be be room temp
IAmA,not_removed,sounds like you are a pm or om at servpro
IAmA,not_removed,so describe that paycheck roughly not to be rude but a ballpark or range would be interesting
IAmA,not_removed,thats very usefulinteresting to know thank you
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know much about guns but it was a rifle that had to have been longer than her arms
IAmA,not_removed,ive never done an outside chemical spill so like your famous bp oil and things like that isnt quite my alley but the worst chemical spill was a small local doctor had a new employee flip the switch that kept all their refrigerated liquids in on a friday it was like a third story water loss except with chemicals three stories of everything it touched torn out it was a fun explaining to every affected office that they cant be open nor be onsite
IAmA,not_removed,well some take ten minutes while others have taken me hours which ill do straight through so customers dont have to live with the loss without me being there helping them
IAmA,not_removed,my experience is that people who own cats and dont take care of them the way they should have no idea how badly their house and belongings smell one of my multiple cat owner customers had white paint on their walls and the bottom two feet of the drywall was stained brown from cat urine either wicking up so badly or the cat spraying directly on the walls it was every wall in the house the smell was putrid and she claimed her house didnt smell like urine or cats because she cleaned daily house clearly hadnt been cleaned in years
IAmA,not_removed,hot water makes blood escape the body quicker accelerating decomposition i should make an edit here because this was the teachers answer when it was asked in class ive personally never experienced a difference because i dont know if the water was hot or cold when it happened
IAmA,not_removed,a good week will bring me in an average week about
IAmA,not_removed,ever find any evdince
IAmA,not_removed,work in cat rescue can confirm crazy cat people get used to the smell and really dont think theres anything wrong cats on the other hand are pretty clean things and if the house smells bad and theres an open window you bet theyll be outside all day
IAmA,not_removed,what impact do you think the brexit referendum will have on the long term viability of the european experiment
IAmA,not_removed,have you been in a situation where the husband immediately starts regretting the whole thingyou boning his wife
IAmA,not_removed,what ethnicity are you the tweet shows black are they just rich white people wanting to get fucked by a black dude
IAmA,not_removed,what advice would you give to a virgin so that he doesnt actually perform like a virgin during his first time with a girl
IAmA,not_removed,holy shit what did you do to get in this position and does it feel mentally great like haha i bang your wife better
IAmA,not_removed,do you have any respect for these women
IAmA,not_removed,what kind of doctor also you kind of missed out not calling yourself dr feelgood
IAmA,not_removed,do you wear condoms because those things suck
IAmA,not_removed,any pregnancies also can you expand the six or seven wives in a single night thing just a tad do you have minute appointments or is it like a meetup thing
IAmA,not_removed,how did you become such a popular swinger especially one that gets called out to be part of cuckolding how do couples find you
IAmA,not_removed,do you have an objective way to compare yourself to other swingers in the community or is the bestgreatestmost popular moniker a guess
IAmA,not_removed,only time will tell i do know however that nigel farage is an asshole
IAmA,not_removed,dont ask irrelevant questions its not funny and contributes nothing
IAmA,not_removed,oh absolutely one time in particular a couple i had met for the first time spent almost half an hour telling me how solid their relationship was they kept fawning over one another and talking about how ready they were to do this once we got back to a resort room and the wife began undressing me i could see the husband was shifting around becoming quite uncomfortable she had seemingly lost sight he was in the room within minutes he started putting on his shoes and getting angry i asked what was wrong they began arguing she began crying i could see his anger was starting to grow so i started putting my clothes on i ran to the car leaving my socks and got the hell out of there
IAmA,not_removed,im a black man and no just rich white people wanting to get fucked by a black dude isnt something i will participate in whenever someone says thats the only thing they want my standard response is no thank you i am not a performing circus monkey however im sure you will have no problem finding someone looking to fill that role good luck
IAmA,not_removed,sorry but youre not going to be amazing your first time be honest with her and let her know youre a virgin a lot of women would find that endearing just relax and let her take control everyone has to have a first time at least once
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely even if some of the sex acts seem disrespectful its all about respect ive never been able to get aroused around someone i didnt have respect for im very conscious that participating in this on both ends involves quite a bit of trust and openness its absolutely something that i must respect
IAmA,not_removed,critical care physician dr feelgood would be funny but the title of gqs article was flattering enough
IAmA,not_removed,you dont know that he doesnt
IAmA,not_removed,porn actresses yes the one that im comfortable saying is chessie moore shes older now but was one of my very first experiences in all this there have been a few others but im not going to disclose them now
IAmA,not_removed,no pregnancies i always wear condoms with random people if its someone ive hooked up with before were both comfortable enough with each other to know a were both disease free and b what precautions her and her husband are taking or women refers to a small house party they wrote about in the story there were several couples there and i was the only single male all the wives took their turns getting to me i forget what order they came in no pun intended but it was a very exhausting evening
IAmA,not_removed,how did i become so popular believe it or not word of mouth once people see me and people see im a respectful guy who doesnt want to just jack rabbit their wife its just sort of a domino effect in terms of how couples find me i did my own research and start scoping out forums and online swinger communities once couples expressed their dessert i found a way of expressing im open to that once people see how comfortable i am and how open i am they start to open up
IAmA,not_removed,its called ask me anything
IAmA,not_removed,couples fly him in from all over the world the brexit situation could certainly have an impact on some of his travels swingers are people too sexy sex having people
IAmA,not_removed,lmao oh wow thats greathorrible lol thanks for the reply
IAmA,not_removed,its not that some sex acts seem disrespectful its that a lot of sex acts are based on the degradation of women
IAmA,not_removed,yeah to be fair not many men are going to complain about that title
IAmA,not_removed,he calls himself dave
IAmA,not_removed,so do you only swing with couples do you have a partner
IAmA,not_removed,hahahahahahahahahaa
IAmA,not_removed,but to his patients
IAmA,not_removed,no dave is his alias
IAmA,not_removed,instead of saying action before video takes do you say okgo
IAmA,not_removed,hello ok go in the one moment video im curious to know how exactly you got the flip books timed so well – how did tim flip and how did andy turn the crank at the precise speed needed to play damians singing in sync also how did tim and andy lip sync in the seconds they did from your bts videos i gathered that you were simply singing really fast but i cant wrap my brain around how fast you must have had to mouth the lyrics in order for your movements to line up as perfectly as they did the whole thing was captivating and im floored by the degree of precision involved in making this video really truly amazing thank you
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys ive been a huge fan since i was young and its been great seeing you do well over the years im studying math at university right now and im always inspired by your ability to use engineering to enhance your art most notably in the recent video i mostly want to thank you guys for being a source of inspiration in that sense since i have to ask a question though what are the backgrounds of the team that you work with to create videos i assume many of them are engineers but i imagine that it takes a special kind of person to be able to consider things from both an aesthetic and scientific point of view id love to hear a little bit about who the behindthescenes people are and how you find them
IAmA,not_removed,hi ok go have you ever considered that youre tellitubbies for grown ups four basic colors four musicians eye catching visuals exactly like tellitubbies or the wiggles also what or who would you say is your greatest inspiration both in your music and your videos

IAmA,not_removed,hey im a huge fan thank you guys for doing this ama when do you guys plan on putting out another albumgoing on tour again in what direction do you plan on taking your music since of the blue colour of the sky was released in your music has become increasingly electronic do you plan on continuing this trend or do you plan on going in a different direction
IAmA,not_removed,damian your wikipedia page describes your formal education as having a specialty in art semiotics ive long been fascinated with that description and really curious what it meant in terms of practical study what did you read what projects did you work on now as a professional rock star do you find that experience was formative or challenged the work you really wanted to be doing

IAmA,not_removed,hey okgo i have a question for andy i noticed at the very end of the upside down inside out music video you had to run back to your seat and i saw you just barely make it when you actually had to throw a luggage bag out of your chair to sit down before gravity doubled again did something like that happen in any of the other takes i just thought it was really funny seeing how you had to frantically throw that bag away and sit down with a i freaking made it face xd

IAmA,not_removed,hello ok go let me start by thanking you for everything you create and being such an inspirational artist im a little behind in your current work bit i did see your latest video another feat thats fun to watch anyway heres my question how did you guys go from this thing has started released in your months of ok go album to here it goes again imo your flagship song and music video i can feel that the final product feels better than this thing has started it just flows better but how did you get to that point exactly likewise with earlier songs like bye bye baby and hello my treacherous friends had different sounds that i actually prefered on the pink and brown eps
IAmA,not_removed,me and my friends went to a planet fitness once and tried to reenact your treadmill video as we were moving one of the treadmills into place the lunk alarm sounded and we were asked to stop we did it again and then we were kicked out our memberships revoked my question is do you guys ever feel like your videos might be slightly irresponsible in that it could inspire people to do things like what we did thanks guys big fan and thanks for doing this ama
IAmA,not_removed,how do you guys take your coffee
IAmA,not_removed,how the absolute heck did you manage the lip sync sections of the one moment
IAmA,not_removed,some questions about the new vid the first set of orbs are pumpkins but what are the second set of orbs that fall onto the columns the flip book looked heavy and i noticed it was strapped to tim how many pictures were in it and what were they printed on how did you get the glass aquarium to break so beautifully was it prescored what is being shot through the white pumpkins in the new vid dan is a beast on that cymbaladorned power tool do you use power tools regularly dan

IAmA,not_removed,why did you guys choose notre dames band and shooting the video in south bend for this too shall pass
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever have fragments of ideas for videos before you have a song written or does a song always inspire the ideas for the video
IAmA,not_removed,hey ok go how many shots did it take you to get the video to upside down inside out done and how many for the the one moment one and who cleans up afterwards
IAmA,not_removed,hey ok go i guess i have more of a request than a question my kids ages and absolutely love your videos my older one requests needinggetting almost nightly and it easily overtook life is a highway as favorite song and going on strong for a good year now that being said any chance of getting more toddlerextra small shirts in the store by christmas hed flip im sure because he definitely recognizes the band name i saw a few on etsy but im sure that revenue doesnt go to you guys and id rather support the band thanks in advance
IAmA,not_removed,do you guys still know the treadmill routine by heart
IAmA,not_removed,everytime i watch your videos i think to myself this is the pinnacle for them there is no way they will be able to beat this but somehow you prove me wrong over and over again so thank you for that do you guys come up with all the concepts for your videos on your own or do you take outside suggestions where do these beautifully complex concepts come from
IAmA,not_removed,i am certainly a fan of your music but is it frustrating that many people identify your band more with the creative music videos than with the actual music
IAmA,not_removed,do you feel you are better musicians now
IAmA,not_removed,hey ok go long time fan of your music two short questions why didnt back from kathmandu get the proper ok go video treatment its such a wonderful song is there footage of the whole events of the one moment in real time
IAmA,not_removed,where would you guys like to see the band in years

IAmA,not_removed,hi i just discovered your music and i really love it wondered if youd considered touring the uk anytime id love to see you live x

IAmA,not_removed,hey love you guys fun music and the videos are always crazy and technically impressive and youre very smart to do different interesting stuff with videos to help drive interest in your music how did you guys come to decide to do something challenging interesting with each video did it all start with the treadmill video and kind of get crazy from there on out
IAmA,not_removed,what inspires your beautifully kick ass awesome music videos you create nina from sri lanka

IAmA,not_removed,will you be selling the paint splattered canvases from the one moment if so i want one for christmas
IAmA,not_removed,hi ok go of the blue colour of the sky is one of my favourite albums but theres something weird i always think about when i listen to it theres exactly one swear word on the whole album its a fuck and it comes in literally the first line of the record as a person who swears quite a bit im australian this seemed kind of odd to me do you try to make a conscious effort to make radiofriendly lyrics and in this case you felt like it was necessary or do you not really think about it at all
IAmA,not_removed,hi ok go i really appreciate all the fan interaction lately thanks i also have many questions and here is one of them do you brainstorm with trish sie frequently or does she get pulled into your ok go project ideas later in the process
IAmA,not_removed,hey ive been wondering since the release of the video for upside down and inside out why you guys have been uploading your videos to facebook first instead of straight to youtube it seemed that your music videos did extroardinarily well when they went straight to youtube so the change just confused me a bit so is this change due to an agreement or is it just trying to expand to new platforms thanks and keep up the awesome work
IAmA,not_removed,how is your underwater music video concept more expensive if executed than the micro gravity music video
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever had any especially crazy ideas for music videos that havent ended up working out
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys i absolutely love hungry ghosts do you have a favorite video are you working on new music now or will there be a break finally what are your favorite foods edit thought of one more do your favorite colors match the colors you wear in the videos
IAmA,not_removed,i love you guys i have all your albums and they always bring happiness to any bad day my question where do you draw inspiration not only for your music but for your videos mad props for the involvement with walkherwalk what an awesome campaign
IAmA,not_removed,hi boys this questions coming to you from brown universitys careerlab more specifically from me elle the comms director here and lifetime fan everywhere else as creative job titles become seemingly more vague im one to talk having held many of them myself im just wondering what youd consider yourself as and what that is does it matter how do you articulate the service on an invoice for clients like morton salt and chevy professional awesomedoing because it is thanks elle
IAmA,not_removed,how much did they might be giants influence you when you toured with them in the early and who are some of your other musical influences my eight year old son loves your videos he would like to know how you made all the gold balloons pop in rapid succession in your latest video the one moment
IAmA,not_removed,ive got some pretty good ideas for videos for you guys you want to hear em
IAmA,not_removed,are there any songs from your catalogue that you would like to hear as performed by a full orchestra if so which songs also would you want to make the arrangements yourself or would you trust someone else to do it
IAmA,not_removed,is everyone in the band great at math and music
IAmA,not_removed,in the rehearsal footage from the stephen colbert show you used a camera it was really cool btw was the actual performance also recorded in if so whenhow will it be available to view
IAmA,not_removed,ive seen you guys multiple times on tour with many great bands who has been your favorite band to tour with
IAmA,not_removed,saludos desde españa país que desea una gira vuestra por aquí ¿os habéis propuesto el reto de realizar alguna canción en uno o varios idiomas distintos muchas gracias y hasta pronto sois geniales greetings from spain country that wants a tour of yours here have you proposed the challenge of performing a song in one or several different languages thank you so much and see you soon you are great
IAmA,not_removed,if you couldnt be in ok go what would you do instead
IAmA,not_removed,firstly i love tims choice to wear white gloves he is always so stylish how big was the crew for the one moment video are you going to tour in canada again i will hand cut all of your confetti if thats what it takes lol how do you choose what band is your opener when you go on tour does damian purposefully put his mic low so that he is constantly in a power stance if so he should do a ted talk about it lol how did you know that the instrement you play was the right choice for you i am currently teaching myself different ones because i cant decide which i like more
IAmA,not_removed,damian what languages do you speak
IAmA,not_removed,are you guys ever going to release the fake it till you make it song it was a sick song during the montage of your music videos and i think us fans would like to hear the full version
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys any chance of an okgoblack keys collab love both of your bands and i think your electric feel would make some amazing things combined with their bluesy grit
IAmA,not_removed,andy i know that you made an app for needinggetting to tell damian how fast to drive and also one for your live performance of needinggetting on the handbells for this american life any other ways youve used cs with ok go
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys just curious how many takes did the this too shall passrube goldberg take before you guys were satisfied and how many weeks did you spend designing and building that whole setup
IAmA,not_removed,howdy ok go loving the new video obviously you get a massive amount of attention for your great music videos but inevitably there will always be some miseryguts wholl accuse it all of being a novelty were you ever concerned that the videos might grab all of the attention from your albums or have the videos always been part of your art in equal measure to your music and if so when did you change your mind and just go with it
IAmA,not_removed,hi ok go ive been a fan ever since my friends and i reenacted the million ways dance video in we entered the youtube dance contest and did not win also dan one time i helped you pick out a picture frame at aaron brothers in studio city it was the highlight of my otherwise uneventful stint working there random q how did you decide to incorporate handbells into your live performances and who did the arrangements my fellow dancevideo friends and i were all auxiliary percussionists in high school and we loved the fact that a rock band would take the time to learn proper handbell technique
IAmA,not_removed,what do you really want to do for your next few music videos i love how crazy yours get
IAmA,not_removed,when did you decide on the viral video angle are you occasionally worried that it overshadows your music or do you feel like they work together
IAmA,not_removed,where do you guys get the inspiration for your videos how do you feel about what seems like a large part of your fan base liking your videos but not necessarily your music
IAmA,not_removed,had any ideas for videos that you were unable to do for technicalcost reasons
IAmA,not_removed,which of your videos took the most time to shoot which is your favorite which one of you would win in a fight
IAmA,not_removed,how long did it take to preppractice getting ready for this video where did the idea come from
IAmA,not_removed,hey damian as far as i can tell the one moment is the first video you solo directed how did that change your experience with the project
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys big fan how long does it take to make your crazy awesome videos were some easier than others
IAmA,not_removed,in your askokgo youtube videos its been implied several times that youre working on a new album anything you want to dramatically reveal in this ama
IAmA,not_removed,love your videos but ive been wondering do you ever think you might be hampering your own creativity by being so committed to onetake type videos do you ever just want to make something thats cut and edited all to hell and see if you can do something great
IAmA,not_removed,hey okgo so loved the one moment video a question about the balloon throwing in the video if they were threw by people like we see in the behind the scenes how did you time that or did that become a robot throwing them love what you guys are doing so much thanks team
IAmA,not_removed,the first moment i realized i was in love was at one of your shows that relationship is over now but i feel like it was a really important moment to who i am now needless to say this video and the way you guys described the inspiration for the song and the video were really important to me can some of you guys talk about important moments in your lives loverelated or otherwise and how the moments informed your music thanks love you guys and the video
IAmA,not_removed,hey ok go your band has remained one of my alltime favorite because of your neverending creativity and work ethic to pull off your vision you are able to make some of the most incredible videos because of partnering with certain companies rather than working under a label ive always wondered what is the process of choosing a company to work with like do they reach out to you the other way around or is it a mix really happy about your working with morton on the latest they seem like a great company thanks for everything ok go
IAmA,not_removed,are you coming back to calgary any time soon i think i finally got rid of all the confetti in my shoes from last time so id say youre about due ps thanks for making such badass music videos youre artists on so many levels
IAmA,not_removed,what was it like shooting a sketch with stephen colbert
IAmA,not_removed,would you collaborate with another band like you did with bonerama this mix made for a few too few great live shows and wonderful reimaginings of ok go songs it would be interesting to hear something like this again who would you like to collaborate with if you had the chance
IAmA,not_removed,heya when you guys are writing new songs are you ever thinking about video ideas during the process or do you wait until an album is completely finished to come up with video ideas that fit the songs
IAmA,not_removed,hey there im a huge fan of you guys sadly i have only been a fan since the video for upside down and inside out which pisses me off because my family has known about you guys for a long time my question for you is what are your favorite songs your own as well as others trying to sound sophisticated falling miserably
IAmA,not_removed,is there any artistband you would like to collab with
IAmA,not_removed,hello huge fan which of your one take videos had the most takes in any cases of those super complex ones were there any of them that you really thought you couldnt pull off after a bunch of times cant wait for your new content
IAmA,not_removed,have you guys ever had an idea for a music video that ended up looking not very exciting when it was tested or an idea that ended up being too dangerous
IAmA,not_removed,huge fan of you guys music and beautifully made music videos ive noticed all your videos have a certain theme to them and i was wondering if there was any consideration to make a video for the great fire if so would there be a theme of fire once again love your guys work and all of the beautiful creativity you bring to this world
IAmA,not_removed,exactly how many snipers did you have hiding in the grassy knoll to shoot all those buckets of paint so efficiently

IAmA,not_removed,i just wanted you guys to know what a huge fan my husband is hes a bassist here in portland and he has been to many of your shows around the country when i was months pregnant i was on bedrest and found out you were playing at portland state university on october he helped me into the show and i sat on a chair against the back wall he stayed with me most of the time what a small venue to put on such a fantastic show i gave birth the following week and weve of course seen you in portland since any shows coming this way soon we want to take this little one to her first postbirth show

IAmA,not_removed,you guys have been one of my favorite bands of all time i have two questions i wanted to know what is the significance of the volvo car on your first album and whose idea was it to sample its a disaster in the end of needinggetting thanks
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys i have been a fan of yours since or so when i kept seeing your first album at my local record store and decided to buy it on impulse i really love the volvo god knows why one thing that i think is amazing about you as a band is that you do really truly creative things to make money and sustain yourselves i think a lot of artists resent the idea of sponsorships like youve done with many of your videos like with morton or i think range rover but you still have very creative and unique marketing without seeming like youre shills how did you get into doing business this way do you see it as a viable way for artists to make a living beyond the music industry and how have you been able to keep your integrity while doing these things
IAmA,not_removed,hello ok go you guys are fantastic your music is my favorite and your music videos are second to none thanks for all of the awesome work that you do i especially love the use of colors in your videos how bright and frankly beautiful they can be is there any inspiration behind the colors you use in a video do you associate your songs with colors do you all have favorite colors you like to use thanks again

IAmA,not_removed,hey ok go long time fan you have such a wide array of different styles of music from get over it to skyscrapers to i dont understand you yet critics of you seem to suggest that you only have one song or your music is one dimensional what do you say to those critics also as a band are you looking to go back to your more rocky roots from your self titled album in the future
IAmA,not_removed,might any of you write a memoir of your crazy experiences or maybe one on behalf of the band

IAmA,not_removed,for otbcots you were thinking of making a video for each song are you going to try to accomplish that with hungry ghosts or is a video for every song too lofty an idea

IAmA,not_removed,i know it is too soon to ask this but will the next hg video be obsession or turn up the radio

IAmA,not_removed,hey guys do you ever listen to older songs that youve written and think it sounds like an entirely different band or have the older songs taken on new meanings im always curious to know when a band has been around as long as you guys have if the older songs youve written become unrelatable to you or just feel like an entirely different lifetime also come back to ottawa please
IAmA,not_removed,do you guys come up with your own ideas for videos or do you have a super creative team that helps come up with them im always curious about how the process comes about for a video in general for bands overall not just you guys im intrigued by how an idea comes along is it generally born from a bandmembers head something cooked up by a label somewhere on a related and then separate note what about tours creatively who comes up with some of the ideas and execution of tours or set design for a tour
IAmA,not_removed,oh god i just woke up and saw this was happening anyway im more than sure you get asked this all the time but what are the chances of you guys coming to australia soon im still yet to see you live and recordings of shows on youtube just isnt the same oh man honestly though your music and your videos are just amazing im blown away every time
IAmA,not_removed,a great fan since here it goes again video how many shoot you need to get the one for the one moment does rube goldberg machine video has any time edition or multiple scenes
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys so back in middle school i was watching your videos and it inspired me to become an engineer which i am currently in college for what would you guys say is your favorite way of bringing the engineering process for you music together with the creative process
IAmA,not_removed,for each member what is your favorite song to play
IAmA,not_removed,through your adventures to fame did you plan on ever making such intricate and popular music videos
IAmA,not_removed,i think yall are very well known for your music videos but i saw you in salt lake city a year or two ago and you guys put on the coolest show ive ever seen at a concert so i know that you guys put a lot of work into your shows whats your budget like for each individual show you guys have what obstacles do you face logistically how many people does it take to put on a show like that is there a specific time when you knew you played the best show you ever had tell us about it
IAmA,not_removed,where did you guys get the amazing idea for that beautiful moment in your new video
IAmA,not_removed,what is your process like to come up with music video ideas
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for doing the ama what would you say is the biggest timefrustration saving tip for shooting rube goldberg style videos
IAmA,not_removed,hi big fun my favorite is needinggetting how ability do you guys want to get for new video
IAmA,not_removed,im probably too late but does the sound of the song decide the music video when you plan them also what are some scrapped ideas for music videos
IAmA,not_removed,damian about a year ago you guys came to lincoln nebraska for two days i was wondering if you remembered walking into the audience and my buddy saying hi im aaron before a song side question you have done needinggetting many different times and in different ways do you have a favorite
IAmA,not_removed,where in chicago exactly are you from and have you had tbk
IAmA,not_removed,my wife wonders if the song the one moment is meant as a proposal to someone after watching the video she felt like the lyrics mixed with the look in your eye at the end of the video was directed at a single person can you tell us whether this is the case or not what was the inspiration for the song
IAmA,not_removed,love your music and videos been listening to them a lot recently how long on average does it take one of your videos to get created thank you for the ama
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever feel like the only reason people pay attention to your music is because of your videos
IAmA,not_removed,i cant keep up with these new acronyms what does ok mean
IAmA,not_removed,which music video was the most challenging and which music video would you do again
IAmA,not_removed,is it a goal to be the guys who make the most impressive music videos or is that something that just happened and now you feel like you have to continue to top your last effort every time
IAmA,not_removed,hello ok go whom thinks of the ideas for the music videos and how do they originate
IAmA,not_removed,what your favourite video that you made i really like the one in antigrav cant remember the damn name
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys got a chance to see you last year in toronto and it was a great show never seen so much confetti in my life i was wondering two things whats the best and the worst experience youve had playing live and what happens to all that confetti haha
IAmA,not_removed,how do you do that
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to be known as the band that has really cool music videos but generic and forgettable music
IAmA,not_removed,llamas or alpacas
IAmA,not_removed,anything you hate about making the videos other than the time it takes
IAmA,not_removed,how do you come up with ideas for your videos
IAmA,not_removed,how on earth did you guys perfectly time your second video
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys when i was little a friend showed me this too shall pass after it recently came out and i thought it was awesome years later this past summer i chanced upon i wont let you down and suddenly realised that i recognised you guys then decided to check out your music and fell in love seriously of the blue colour in the sky contains by far some of the best music my ears have been lucky to receive and for that i thank and applaud you all so much my question is this out of them all what was your favourite video to make
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys i love your work seeing as youre very well known for your creative music videos what other artists or even music video directors do you all personally think have really cool music videos
IAmA,not_removed,as a graphic designer you guys are actually one of my biggest inspirations because even though you are musicians youre work and videos end up being a designers wet dream the use of colors and shapes are phenomenal where does that come from do any of you have a background in graphic design
IAmA,not_removed,what is favourite band for each of you guys
IAmA,not_removed,where does damian come up with all of his unique ideas for the videos how long do they usually take to plan also any austin tx concerts upcoming i won some tickets to your show via twitter a few years ago and wasnt able to attend i want to make things right
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys could you tell us about your new album have you started making songs
IAmA,not_removed,hello and hope you all lovely people are enjoying your tuesday afternoon thank you for doing this ama i love how upbeat your songs are and how creative and intricate your videos are what do you all do when youre in a creative rut an aspiring artist currently in a rut haha
IAmA,not_removed,were the treadmills bought or rented
IAmA,not_removed,meat or fish
IAmA,not_removed,damian why do you stretch your legs so widely when you sing
IAmA,not_removed,i wont gush but just know that i love your work when deciding to make a music video does the track hold more importance than the concept for the video or do you have an execution in mind that you just put on the back burner until the right single comes along also have you considered collaborating with any other musicians for future albums last one is there a song from your past discography that doesnt have a video that any of you would want to revisit i saw someone else mention back from kathmandu that would be tight
IAmA,not_removed,good day i was wondering what is the song at the end of needinggetting where it sounds like its in a diner melissa
IAmA,not_removed,i cant believe the things you guys do in your videos do you dabble in the black arts
IAmA,not_removed,damian would you merry me
IAmA,not_removed,at the end of the writings on the wall video damien shouts cut and everyone in the crew walks up to him and the rest of the band kind of loiter about is damien the boss of the band haha
IAmA,not_removed,hello im a big fan what are your thoughts on youre a fucking nerd and nobody likes you thank you
IAmA,not_removed,hi guys im so excited you guys have put out another music video ive been a big fan of you guys for almost a decade now and your music has really impacted my life in a lot of ways ive seen you guys live at least five times and ive gotta say im always super impressed by the amount of energy you guys have when you put on a show i have so many questions that i really dont know where to start how do you guys manage to be so constantly energetic when youre touring how does it feel knowing so many of your music videos end up being show in classrooms all the time do you get sick of hearing how are you going to top x video and lastly i just want to thank you for your music i deal with a bit of anxiety issues and this too shall pass is incredibly calming for me when i start having panic attacks youre music is incredibly relatable and i can listen to of the blue color of the sky constantly its very soothing and uplifting in its own way anyhow thanks for reading i really appreciate the things you guys do
IAmA,not_removed,do you plan to do any other collabs or maybe even tours with perfume
IAmA,not_removed,are you coming back to oregon anytime soon i went to your show on the oregon state campus in or for my first ever concert ive been desperate to see you guys live again since that night as of now which of your music videos was your favorite to complete and which is your favorite of the final products im still most blown away by the needinggetting music video you guys released a few years ago
IAmA,not_removed,when how did you guys decided your videos had to be mindblowing nerdiness
IAmA,not_removed,honestly i love your videos but you music is mediocre do you think youd be as well known as you are if you didnt have such wonderful videos
IAmA,not_removed,do you guys just walk into a random gym and dance on treadmills alsois mayonnaise an instrument
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever feel like your videos overshadow your music or generally decreases the quality of your music due to the focus on the next hot viral video
IAmA,not_removed,are you corny people irl or is it just your music
IAmA,not_removed,what will you do next to top the treadmills do you get tired of being known for the treadmills
IAmA,not_removed,what if thats the actual reason they named the band that way
IAmA,not_removed,at some of their concerts back in they would hold a little qa between songs this question was actually asked and damian and tim said that they met in an art camp they had this stoner camp counselor who would always just seem distant during their activities one day they had to do this time trial painting activity and he counted it off like ok ok ok go then it just stuck with them
IAmA,not_removed,wait are you the real davenn
IAmA,not_removed,tim and andy both lip synced at triple speed and we timed those sections out as if we were shooting at fps with a base rate of for the whole video we were actually shooting much faster frame rates than that and then we sped that footage up afterwards syncing the flip book and the kinetoscope the thing andy is driving tim had to practice a lot getting the flip book to flip at an even speed and then once he got that right he had to begin his move within about one tenth of a second of the right moment that sounds very fast but think of it as if he were playing bass if his notes were off by a full tenth of a second youd be like what is the matter with that bassist is he drunk once hes within a tenth of a second of the target moment we could varispeed the playback to make sure he was right on notice that there are no synced events happening behind him to give away any time nudging we had to do andys kinetoscope had a governor on it so it would run the right speed no matter what and we sent it a digital start command to start spinning at the right time basically all andy had to do was crank it to provide the extra force to get those flaps moving at the insane speed we needed damian
IAmA,not_removed,usually we find people who are great at something and we ask them to look at it from a slightly different angle than normal for the rgm for this too shall pass for instance it took a lot of back and forth to get everyone on the same page about what makes a rube goldberg machine feel like a rube goldberg machine engineers normally prioritize making things that always work and dont fail but things that cant fail and look like they cant fail arent all that interesting to watch at least if youre thinking in the rgm mode the engine in your car is more complicated than any given part of our rgm but you probably dont pop the hood just to gaze in wonder very often the spirit of an rgm is in part precariousness so we were asking the engineers to come at their normal process from the side design for aesthetics in that case precariousness rather than what theyd normally do consistency basically its usually our job to do the aesthetic thinking and we try to find talented people whose specialized knowledge we can apply that aesthetic thinking to it helps that were kind of generalists ourselves like for my fluency with math and physics is enough that i could plan out what we wanted to have happen it took a little trigonometry a little algebra and remembering a few things from high school physics like the fact that the period of a pendulum a function of the length of the string and has almost nothing to do with the mass of the pendulum but beyond that i was relying on specialized knowledge that lives in bigger brains than my own i knew enough to figure out that if we wanted the water balloons to pop on notes they had to be exactly milliseconds apart but arnie who built the solidstate timer that actually triggered them is dealing with vastly more complicated math computer science and electrical engineering than i could even begin to describe a shorter answer to your question our projects usually attract the weirdest and most adventurous people within whatever field we are dabbling in and if they dont come to us we go looking for them damian
IAmA,not_removed,ooh yes please answer this one
IAmA,not_removed,after this past thanksgiving i certainly feel like a grown up tellitubby andy
IAmA,not_removed,dan here we kinda go through every feeling out there at some point nearly every video shoot we all get a feeling of oh shoot we arent gonna pull this off are we but then we do
IAmA,not_removed,hi there thanks for your question weve just started writing more songs and to be honest we never really know what direction were gonna go when we sit down initially if i were to guess i think maybe we might explore a slightly more organic route pick up guitars again maybe program a little less but really well go where ever each day takes us its hard to know what mood well be in untill were just sitting and writing tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here were not too sure yet its usually a surprise when we get into the studio my hopes are high for a tour in and some studio time as well
IAmA,not_removed,i read a lot of post structuralists and i remember very little of what they actually said there was a lot of foucault derrida and barthes what i learned was mostly just a more suspicious way of thinking i was going to say critical but it wasnt exactly that the curriculum of critical theory sunk in it was more that i started questioning more of what id always thought was obvious and self evident we live in very temporary and arbitrary circumstances and very little of the world and culture around us is the way it is because of some innate natural laws so that was the academic part about half and the other half was making art i didnt love the visual arts department at my school so i spent more of my time in the campus music studio and i started turning in recordings to visual arts professors which they loved usually reinterpetting the fundamental rules of the assignment was a good thing my final thesis for my ba in visual art was an album of elvis covers they still come up on ebay every once in a while d
IAmA,not_removed,the largest budgets weve had for our videos have been for the ones with brands involved and were never allowed to disclose the costs but suffice it to say there isnt a chance in hell we could have made the more elaborate ones without the collaboration of a courageous brand and i say courageous because its always amusing to note the small fraction of viewers who complain that theyve been tricked into watching a commercial when they realize that a brand has supported the project very few brands will take the risk of supporting art with their promo budgets its safer for them to make the annoying or ads that you have to suffer through to watch anything these days so were always extremely grateful when a brand offers us the chance to make the art we want to make theres no way the one moment could exist without their investment you can get a recording of our more mellow acoustic version of white knuckles from our day trotter sessions damian
IAmA,not_removed,was it ssx
IAmA,not_removed,i would say im having as much as fun as everybody else which is to say at certain points were having a lot of fun and certain points were not i found the zero gravity video to be particularly challenging by the end of the shoot i was starting to get tunnel vision and dizziness during the parabolas and really wanted it to be finished andy
IAmA,not_removed,theres a screen shot of the first of it here we have to keep some things mysterious damian
IAmA,not_removed,i think we can make this happen stay tuned andy
IAmA,not_removed,the pixies surfer rosa tim
IAmA,not_removed,led zeppelin ii andy
IAmA,not_removed,purple rain damian
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i remember the moment i realized tim was famous we were at an airport and all these girls came running up to him and asked for his autograph i walked right by unnoticed ahhh i remember that lovely day
IAmA,not_removed,my favorite was sequel the reddishbrown and white border collie and yes we have a flourishing penpal relationship his handwriting is terrible andy
IAmA,not_removed,bunny the small brown dog on the table is my dog doras dog both dogs live in my house but dora is my dog and bunny is doras dog dora is good bunny is bad but bunny cares about food so much that shell do anything if food is involved to make her and spike look back and forth like that there was spray cheese on a tennis ball being waved back and forth anyway im still in touch with her she got skunked the night before last damian
IAmA,not_removed,dan here prince i was showing my year old all of his music around that time it hit home hard total genius
IAmA,not_removed,dan here the most fun for me was the weightless vid i mean it was horrifying too but once we got the jist of it it was really a blast not sure which was the longest
IAmA,not_removed,as i recall it was for jane magazine they did a sort of jokey piece on how reading is sexy so they got a bunch of people to pose naked but not actually revealing anything with books exept who knows where the book is it also provides a nice platform for people to make fun of me damian
IAmA,not_removed,getting straight to the important stuff
IAmA,not_removed,jesus christ
IAmA,not_removed,sexuality in its rawest form and im a straight male
IAmA,not_removed,oh my
IAmA,not_removed,yeah what is the story with that
IAmA,not_removed,they got asked this on the last ama too no answer was given
IAmA,not_removed,we were just trying to create as much chaos at the end so it wasnt always guaranteed that i could make back to my seat you can actually watch all the takes of the end here i actually think it was a pretty great save since that was definitely the best take of the end andy
IAmA,not_removed,poor andy he looked ill at the end ha
IAmA,not_removed,we shot the end by attaching the camera to rope that went though a pulley attached to a crane and was literally tied around a burly dude who walked away from us when we needed the camera to go up after about four consecutive takes where the camera swung wildly out of control on the ascent i asked our director brian perkins what planb was his response there is no planb luckily the wind cooperated for a few takes andy
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i really want all the stuff my kid wants if he gets the cool stuff thats out there i know ill have a blast with them too ill make sure santa knows its two for one on xmas am
IAmA,not_removed,we once were given busts of our heads made out of candy that was impressive and delicious tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here die hard is the best xmas movie shoot the glass
IAmA,not_removed,dan here no joke its the one moment
IAmA,not_removed,theres a version of white knuckles available on youtube though the video wasnt really designed for it so its not a tremendously intense effect
IAmA,not_removed,hi i think you gotta do you thebookcottage if youre feeling the tattoo thats whats most important im glad we could create something that inspires you creatively we once tried to think of the worst tattoo in the world while up late on tour with our good friend brian l perkins we came up with a back tattoo of jar jar bincs slam dunking a basketball while eating a slice of pizza with the words party time written in old english underneath him i suppose if you got that that would be the weirdest tattoo tribute you could do for us tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here nah i think its cool you have an okgotattoo glad its helped you on the dating scene the weirdest hmm i think a get over it tramp stamp would be awful and awesome any okgo thing as a tramp stamp would awesomely awful good idea at the time
IAmA,not_removed,what does your tattoo say
IAmA,not_removed,usually its take on me by aha total eclipse of the heart performed by bonnie tyler or this charming man by the smiths tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here mine is we can work it out the beatles
IAmA,not_removed,oh darling the beatles damian
IAmA,not_removed,dan here im and happy to make art for a living and bring cool stuff into the world cant please everybody all the time
IAmA,not_removed,a couple answers to similar qs from earlier amas one thing that always seems too obvious to even point out when we get asked this a band trying to make music that everyone in the world likes is a shitty band the closest thing i can think to universally loved music is the beatles and even they were told the hype was overshadowing their music were extremely grateful and extremely lucky that so many millions of people share our videos but we dont expect everyone who sees them to be instant fans of our music damian when plays on the radio i dont usually like it but millions of other people do think of our videos as our own private radio station that tens of millions of people tune into for a few minutes every few months lots of people love the song and lots dont
IAmA,not_removed,dan here itd be so wonderful to shoot a video in hawaii
IAmA,not_removed,dan here the weigtless video was the most fun for me i mean we could bounce around the plane like spiderman if you ever get a chance to take one of those flights you really must so fun
IAmA,not_removed,we recorded the demo this thing has started in la but recorded the final version which turned into here it goes again in malmo sweden with our producer tore johannson i remember tore wasnt crazy about the demo thought it sounded too cheesy with its organ and kind of pop feel but recognized that there was something catchy about it he said that he might like it better if it sounded like the clash or the jam were playing it so we stripped the whole song down and started over again kept the beat minimal the guitars angular and the arrangement to the point i think in the end we got something we all liked and agreed i prefer the earlier versions of bye bye baby and hello my treacherous friends tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i actually prefer
IAmA,not_removed,i dont drink coffee only tea egyptian liquorice tim
IAmA,not_removed,for me i recorded video of me singing the song in real time and then sped it up from there i watched the shape of my mouth and tried to figure out sounds that made those shapes the sounds were something like obileegabalee obileegabalee for the line open your arms to me open your arms to me besides that we played a click track for me to count when the lip synching moments happened it was all very quick and i also had to keep in mind choreography of when to start and end the flip book tim
IAmA,not_removed,about to sign off sorry not enough time for all the first set of orbs were watermelons not pumpkins the second set were glass lamp shades like for sconces spray painted blue and filled with plastic gems from the dollar store damian
IAmA,not_removed,this is a great set of qs
IAmA,not_removed,yes i was standing behind bulletproof glass i am delicate flower and dont need any shards of glass in my eyeholes ive always said id be happy if the cubs won the world series andy
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i was kind of hoping we wouldve been able to display super human strength like lifting a piano with one hand or playing catch with volkswagon bug
IAmA,not_removed,dan here gosh darn i hope so those girls are amazing so sweet
IAmA,not_removed,dan here id like to see a pool filled with skateboarders up to the brim with rad skaters and their boards sleeping
IAmA,not_removed,dan here hot for teacher van halen
IAmA,not_removed,one saturday afternoon while recording our album of the blue colour of the sky we saw the notre dame marching band perform our song here it goes again for their halftime show we didnt know theyd be doing that and it got us really excited so we reached out to their band leader at the time and told them wed love to collaborate with them on something they were really excited to link up and we enlisted our friend brian perkins to come in and help direct the marching band version of this too shall pass they were awesome to work with tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here its pretty much the latter
IAmA,not_removed,dan here not really i mean if they like anything of ours its cool i dont like the mcrib but i love the quarter pounder mcds probably doesnt mind
IAmA,not_removed,yes i think were probably better musicians then we were twenty years ago when we first started during the recording of our first record i took bass lessons with wrecking crew bassist carol kaye for about eight months and she really helped open my mind up to groove theory and melody which not only helped my playing but my writing as well weve also played hundreds if not thousands of shows together over the years and so weve become much more in tune with each others feels tim
IAmA,not_removed,thats a good question in some ways yes im much better playing with a group and in the studio and definitely a better vocalist and keyboard player but one of the side effects of touring is that you dont feel like practicing when youre home so i almost never do as a pure guitarist im definitely worse than i was years but probably a better overall musician andy
IAmA,not_removed,dan here it did and yes at the top of the the one moment video you see it it lasts seconds thank you for being a fan
IAmA,not_removed,like dans answer above in hawaii andy
IAmA,not_removed,its true theyre clever lads
IAmA,not_removed,check out damians previous response to this type of question
IAmA,not_removed,dan here id still really love to do something with the flaming lips we love those guys we share the same producer for our albums too
IAmA,not_removed,dan here nah i did think about putting some hydrolics on my old car
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i have a year old boy hes amazing he loves transformers and minions and video games i get to watch him get into things thats a real joy he knows im in these videos and i think he thinks theyre super silly dad why are you always the one getting paint splatted on you
IAmA,not_removed,check out days of ok go on youtube they have some covers and fun stuff there
IAmA,not_removed,i think it should be obsession
IAmA,not_removed,if you havent seen them already check out their background notes very cool insight into the video
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i do i also love love love van halen
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i believe they were bought we were charged a restocking fee when we brought them back
IAmA,not_removed,the treadmills were bought and returned for a restocking fee it was impossible to find a place that would rent eight treadmills at the time we werent working with a production team or anything like that it was just the four of us and trish sie before returning them we used erasers to wipe away the scoff marks we had made with our shoes tim
IAmA,not_removed,dan here meat
IAmA,not_removed,dan here he does that because of the thrust from his breath it lowers his center of gravity
IAmA,not_removed,dan here its pretty subjective i think i think if you were there while we were making the songs you may feel a little differently about the tunes too the music is made before the videos theyre separate things i love both things we do
IAmA,not_removed,harsh
IAmA,not_removed,well thats fucking rude
IAmA,not_removed,dan here i think our music is awesome but hey i love these dudes and love making art with thm i dont think wed be as popular wo the videos oh well youre still on here peace
IAmA,not_removed,dan here no and no
IAmA,not_removed,dan here nope and nope
IAmA,not_removed,dan here we arent too corny in real life the music can do lots of things sorry if we let you down dude
IAmA,not_removed,dan here weve topped that one a while back that was a looong time ago were known for a lot of the other videos you are aware of those no
IAmA,not_removed,iirc they named the band ok go because a music professor or something would say that to kick things off not sure though
IAmA,not_removed,this is actually somewhat close
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,ill be honest i was really yankin that crank shaft andy
IAmA,not_removed,tim and andy both lip synced at triple speed and we timed those sections out as if we were shooting at fps that is incredible
IAmA,not_removed,so the lip syncingflip book wasnt a green screen effect added in after the fact that makes me so happy my husband was certain it was but i had faith because you guys think these things out so throughly awesome awesome video
IAmA,not_removed,awesome tim and andy really nailed the art of flipping and cranking thanks for answering the entire process of making this video sounds absolutely fascinating
IAmA,not_removed,i bet this was damian answering this one the long answers are always him
IAmA,not_removed,thats awesome that you guys can bounce back like that and always pull it off in the end much love
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for answering yall are like my favorite band so that really means a lot follow up question have you considered putting out an acoustic album i know you have a few acoustic songs out there and they sound great and id love to hear more
IAmA,not_removed,thats awesome if you do end up touring would you consider making dallas a stop on your route
IAmA,not_removed,hey if you guys could stop by the diamond ballroom again or any oklahoma city venue thatd be awesome
IAmA,not_removed,that sounds excellent thanks very much for the reply
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for the answer you are one of my very favorite bands and i appreciate the response
IAmA,not_removed,no it was thrilville off the rails

IAmA,not_removed,thanks damian

IAmA,not_removed,this reminds me of the time i was waiting outside of a venue for your concert in toronto i saw dan leave the tour bus and walk right past the whole crowd in line and nobody noticed or said anything i really badly wanted to say hi but i also didnt want to bring attention to him because i figured he wanted some time for himself before the show
IAmA,not_removed,hey its me
IAmA,not_removed,why hasnt dora taught bunny to stay way from skunks yet
IAmA,not_removed,im surprised you did it tbh

IAmA,not_removed,this is going to sound really strange but the head coach of my rowing team is named brian l perkins when i read that i was extremely confused
IAmA,not_removed,lol since i am a girl i might have to do this one thanks dan
IAmA,not_removed,and i thought i couldnt love tim more than i already do swoon

IAmA,not_removed,that would be nice i love that album
IAmA,not_removed,fair enough thanks for the reply
IAmA,not_removed,i totally forgot to check back on this and i realized my question came off kind of dickish im actually a fan of the band i guess my follow up would be if the concept for videos comes following the song or vice versa chicken egg theory thanks keep up the good work guys
IAmA,not_removed,dan im loving all your honest and heartfelt responses to the wet blankets that are showing up you guys rock and theres plenty of us out here that love your music just as much as everything else you do thank you for all of the art you guys make
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for responding dan i feel honored now no sarcasm i guess i really havent but i now i feel i should are there lots of rube goldberg machines
IAmA,not_removed,rnocontext
IAmA,not_removed,yes we have talked about doing a record thats more on the mellow acoustic side of things we have so many acoustic songs that have never seen the light of day so perhaps in the future well put that all together tim
IAmA,not_removed,i knew it i was about to ask but i saw this comment this game so many memories and the park radio in general was so good and i still go back and listen to some of the songs the best in my opinion being the ok go and the jon reuben songs
IAmA,not_removed,wow i got into ok go through that game as well
IAmA,not_removed,ha im making sure those windchimes are getting played andy
IAmA,not_removed,i hope at least one girl that has worked at a starbucks and has thought someone looks like damian from ok go reads this and thinks omg i met damian from okgo but didnt actually meet damian from ok go because the world is amazing and this has happened more than once
IAmA,not_removed,thats ok wed recognize all of you
IAmA,not_removed,he can type pretty well for having paws
IAmA,not_removed,if its anything like my twitter account just dont use it for a month then youll get an email from twitter saying a chinese hacker has taken your account from you theyll give you a temporary password that wont work and boom the account is gone
IAmA,not_removed,ok gay
IAmA,not_removed,please make that come true
IAmA,not_removed,nah nah my bad i put this in my coffee
IAmA,not_removed,a little bit yeah she would often times use songs she had recorded on to give examples of something she was teaching me i remember her once using the bass line from good vibrations to show me something and saying something like brian liked it when i played it like this because and my brain just kind of melted tim
IAmA,not_removed,i cant tell if your comments are serious or not you should really look them up on youtube if you actually havent seen any of their other videos
IAmA,not_removed,oh shit please do that itd be incredible
IAmA,not_removed,i love your more mellow work skyscrapers is one of my favorite songs by you guys
IAmA,not_removed,hfe masn abhofve ijs an impolsdtgre
IAmA,not_removed,i was serious though after i looked up some videos on youtube i vaguely remembered actually having seen some of the other videos like the one with the rube goldberg machine
IAmA,not_removed,who comes up with the scenarios why would there even be a need for a picture like that
IAmA,not_removed,i am not a model but i do use stock images often for my business and have close contacts with photogs as well typically the stock image is an image from a shoot that the subjects and photographer have released the rights to so sometimes there isnt just a specific photo shoot for stock photos sometimes there are and they are just random images with release id love to hear the story behind this one i look forward to reading the other answers
IAmA,not_removed,this looks very interesting
IAmA,not_removed,this has to happen
IAmA,not_removed,its simple the photog wants to make some gaytheme pics because the subject is hot right now so he gets a couple of models dresses them up as fruitloops and adds a banana for some of the pictures what part of this is so deep its beyond your comprehension
IAmA,not_removed,banana fetish in a gay relationship thats the only way
IAmA,not_removed,i know im late from this but hopefully you see it anyhow im not sure if this is even really the kind of thing thats in your wheelhouse but its a questions ive been struggling with for awhile my wife has always been a big girl she was big when i met her and ive never had a problem with this i love her and she is beautiful and sexy to me shes also pretty sensitive about her weight i think it was a pain point as a child with teasing and what not when she had our first child she gained a lot of weight well beyond normal pregnancy gains after she gave birth she didnt really lose any of it and over the next several years put on some more weight when she was pregnant with our second child she was so already so big that you couldnt even tell by looking at her that she was carrying im not sure how big shes actually gotten to over the years but im sure well north of if not closing in on after the second birth she seemed to get a fire under her to lose the weight she began eating better taking walks got prescribed some appetite suppressants from her doctor she even joined weight watchers during this period she lost a ton of weight and it affected not just her looks but her confidence she wore nicer clothes she smiled more and was just generally brighter i was super proud of her achievements this was like years ago im not sure what happened but at some point she seemed to have given up she stopped the ww program became even more sedentary and began eating for convenience more than health a lot of takeout delivery fast food etc over the years ive watched her undo all of her previous hard work shes easily over again her general demeanor has gone from bubbly to almost resigned she often makes selfdeprecating jokes about her looks her confidence is gone and that breaks my heart ive always told her that shes beautiful and that id love her no matter how much she weighs and thats true she means everything to me but at this point in our lives late i worry about her health it scares me because her parents are both big and her father has had multiple heart surgeries already i want her with me for the long haul my question is how do i light that fire again im afraid that if i say things even with sincerity like hey have you thought about trying ww again or maybe dont buy junk food at the store or something that shell take offense and feel like im commenting on her looks killing her confidence even more how do i broach the subject of weight loss with a spouse who is sensitive about their weight without hurting them or making it seem like i just think theyre too fat i just love her too much to keep watching her stay on this path but i dont want to hurt her in my attempts to direct her on to a better one every time i consider saying something in my head i sound like a dick or like im judging but i dont care what she looks like i just want her with me healthy and happy thank you for any advice at all
IAmA,not_removed,what is the most widely believed misconception about obesity
IAmA,not_removed,whats your take on healthy fat ie someone who is obese but has good overall health stats bp blood sugar cholesterol etc does your work touch much on this also curious what kinds of negative outcomes you have seen for obese patients due to weight stigma from healthcare providers but i imagine those stories get depressing has anything in particular stuck with you
IAmA,not_removed,whats your views on the bmi scale do you feel its an adequate scale to measure if someone is overweight or obese etc when everybodys body type and frame is completely different
IAmA,not_removed,hi dr gudzune thanks for doing this ama im sorry i missed it but hope you come back to answer this what do you think of the new fda approval of the stomach pump device ive struggled with obesity my entire adult life but this feels like statesanctioned bulimia to me i have bingeeating disorder and i know a bunch of people who would very likely abuse this how would you be able to prevent that and as a second question what do you think is the best approach to weight loss you mentioned you work a lot with stigma so do you recommend seeing a therapist along with diet and exercise thanks
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think is the most prominent difference between care for an overweight patient and one that is not
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the ama has there been a turning point in obesity research and medicine in the last couple of years if so what was it what are the weights you would give to the environment around us and genetics the greatest potential reasons that lead to obesity eg
IAmA,not_removed,hi dr gudzune thank you for doing this ama my boyfriend used to be heavily obese but lost a good chunk of weight thanks to the ketogenic diet right now his bmi is within the overweight range the keto diet initially worked wonders for weight loss but right now his weight loss seems to have stalled do you have any advice for furthering weight loss at this stalling point additionally i was wondering if you have any insights on whether there are any downsides to the keto diet thank you
IAmA,not_removed,given your acknowledgement of the stigma of obesity in the eyes of some healthcare providers is there any advice you have for patients who are obese and in search of a new pcp to help them address their weighthealth thank you for this ama
IAmA,not_removed,where were you born and can you tell me more about your education did you go to med school
IAmA,not_removed,im curious do certain racesethnicities tend to carry their weight differently im hispanic and as of late ive noticed lots of latin women tend to develop a more apple shaped or top heavymid section heavy figure compared to black and white women what is the cause of this shape and is there a way to change it
IAmA,not_removed,i missed the timing but maybe itll get seen later anyhow how much may gut bacteria have to do with this kind of problem i heard there was some research and are there any probiotics that could possibly help with this
IAmA,not_removed,when zombies eat where does the food godo they poop
IAmA,not_removed,hey i just saw this ama and that the dr didnt appear to catch your question in time im not an md by any means but i am in school to become a physician assistant and have worked for almost a decade in both pharmacy and parttime as a personal trainer i wanted to share with you the bit of advice i have since you didnt get any responses you sound like a very loving supportive husband and thats definitely the kind of environment which fosters success and self esteem furthermore your concern for her comes from a genuine care about her health and longevity of life rather than from something like embarrassment of her appearance and that surely shows in how you speak to her about the topic and obviously the amount of care you take in finding out more infowriting this question to the doc those are huge positive elements in the dynamic between spousessos when something like weight loss is the topic at hand and youre doing right by your wife in those aspects you know that any marriage is essentially a team and that when part of your team is weakened you work even harder to provide that extra boost we dont know why your wife has seemingly begun to feel defeated but to give her that spark back try taking the team approach to weight loss and fitness make it not about her health and wellness but your own go to her with concerns about your own fitness and dietary wellness make the need for change your own rather than hers describe the things you think you need to work on meal planninghealthy eating going to the gym regularly or just taking a walk around the neighborhood each evening as a form of exerciselight cardio and explain why youre concerned eg i read this article about how men my age are at greater risk of heart disease and diabetes now than ever before and how its causing them to lose years off their lives and ive been doing a lot of the things they talked about and genuinely ask her to help you with it she may go to selfdeprecation at first but remind her of how awesome she was with this kind of thing back when she lost all that weight etc the idea being that since marriage is teamwork she may be likely put in more effort toward helping you reach your goals begin eating healthier meals together go on those walks with you each night than she has in reaching her own goals i saw this a lot when i trained couples together in duosessions each spouse would devote more effort to scheduling and actually attending training sessions as well as put in greater effortwork on each task during the session than either one had previously when they attempted it solo most did eventually after weeks or so begin to show the same genuine effort during their gym regimen when i would see them working out solo on the days between sessions having an accountability partner is kind of the idea here just instead of suggesting it to her you are asking her to be yours well thats my best advice from what experience ive gained through the years im sorry im not the dr or able to give the same level of info she could but i wish you and your wife health happiness and longevity
IAmA,not_removed,the love and concern that you have for your wife is clear and i acknowledge your desire to have her with you for the long run i want that for you both too that said if you can work on this as a couple that might be the best strategy forward approaching her with the idea that youd like her help on being healthier together its important to not come across as judging her or targeting her as an individual down the road it will also be important to understand why things changed years ago and what triggered her to give up however this is something that is likely a sensitive issue ultimately involving a counselor or therapist oneonone and has a couple may help support you both in the longrun
IAmA,not_removed,i would suggest telling her what you just told us offering to help but refusing to nag ie if she wants help shopping for or choosing healthy food then give it but if she makes clear shes fine with being fat then you have to choose to accept her unconditionally or dump her source someone who was not a good fit with my previous so who neither loved me as i was nor was willing to man up and leave constant nagging eg maybe you should just have a salad to someone who clearly is happily fat devalues ones selfworth more in the long run than being dumped
IAmA,not_removed,given that much of my research centers around weight stigma i would say the idea that the individual who struggles with weight is solely to blame its usually much more complicated than that and causing people to feel really guilty rather than supporting them leads us nowhere
IAmA,not_removed,we know that on an individual level that not everyone responds to excess weight in the same way there is a lot of variety in what different bodies can handle weightwise however given that epidemiological studies studies who follow a large number of people over time show a link between obesity and diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease over the longterm even if a person is healthy obese now i do still worry about their risks in the long run particularly if there is a strong family history of diabetes or heart disease regarding your second question i have found that patients who experience stigma in healthcare tend to doctor shop more this leads to poor continuity of care providers tend to engage less in forming an emotional connection with their overweight and obese patients in addition individuals working on weight loss tend not to lose as much weight when they feel judged by their healthcare provider
IAmA,not_removed,bmi is a good indicator of the degree of adiposity the amount the of fat tissue for most people bmi can be enhanced by adding on assessment of waist circumference which when elevated has been linked to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease
IAmA,not_removed,the new device that the fda approved showed weight loss benefits although i think that clinicians will have to consider carefully which patients would benefit from this treatment strategy as a physician i always want to make sure that my treatment plan balances the benefits risks and harms for each individual regarding your second question i think that a multidisciplinary approach is usually best finding the right combination of nutrition exercise therapy and medical management for each individual is key for many the addition of a therapist is essential to address the behavioral and psychological realms
IAmA,not_removed,patients with overweight and obesity often experience negative attitudes and stigma from healthcare providers and staff while lots of people dont really like going to the doctor the experience can be even worse if you walk away feeling judged or mistreated
IAmA,not_removed,there has been growing recognition of obesity as a problem in the us and abroad which has stimulated more research interest in this area over the last to years while obesity has always been recognized as an issue it was really in the late that we began to appreciate the complexity of factors that contribute to body weight in particular the physical and social environments while genetics will always be a factor i see the world around us as a bigger influence and the only one that is modifiable in order to make a difference
IAmA,not_removed,during the weight loss journey everyone experiences a plateau where they just dont seem to lose much weight anymore there are a lot of ideas about why this happens your body may become more efficient so its harder to get the calorie imbalance to lose weight your body has a set point that it wants to stay at etc when you reach the plateau it can sometimes helps by mixing things up a bit such as adding on different types of exercise and increasing their intensity other times trying a different dietary approach for a while can get things going its important to keep a close eye on things by selfmonitoring your weight when you make these changes ketogenic diet can be a good solution and it sounds like it has worked well for your boyfriend the hardest part is sticking with in the long run as we often have to keep up the good habits that we started during our weight loss journey in order to keep it off and sometimes even do a little more in regards to exercise
IAmA,not_removed,rfitness would be a better resource bear in mind dr gudzune basically thinks the individual cannot do what your bf just did
IAmA,not_removed,i think its key to find a pcp with whom you have a good rapport and who you feel understands and supports you i would suggest getting recommendations from family and friends to narrow down the pool of pcps that you might consider then set up an initial appointment with your top choice during this appointment i would be up front about what you are looking for in a pcp and ask whether this provider feels that you could work together to meet these goals if you dont get a response that you feel comfortable with then i would move down your list
IAmA,not_removed,i was born in the us i went to medical school at tulane
IAmA,not_removed,there is good scientific evidence that shows that rates of obesity differ by race and ethnicity although there is likely multiple factors that lead to these differences where you carry your weight can alter your risk for other health conditions linked with obesity in particular if you carry more weight around your midsection or belly this suggests that you have greater adipose tissue in your organs visceral adiposity which is linked with higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease we assess this in the clinic with waist circumference an elevated waist circumference for a woman is cm
IAmA,not_removed,the link between gut bacteria and obesity is a very active area of research right now although we still have a lot to learn before we can start using the information in clinical practice like whether probiotics can be helpful hopefully we will have some more definitive answers in the coming years
IAmA,not_removed,a theoretically fascinating question maybe the creators of the walking dead might be able to give you an answer
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for this i am also overweight but not dramatically so even so i think i can use this as a tactic to help her self motivate through helping me i appreciate your insight thank you for taking the time
IAmA,not_removed,so youre saying that fat shaming is useless
IAmA,not_removed,this is so interesting thanks so much im psyched to look yalls work up
IAmA,not_removed,is there being anything done to stop that sort of behavior
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your reply i saw something on the internet and was hoping you could confirm whether or not it is correct because you cant believe everything you find on google search right does the keto diet lead to or increase the risk of development of kidney stones
IAmA,not_removed,thank you very much for taking the time to reply i appreciate your insight
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,its an area that many researchers are working on not only to define the magnitude of the problem but also working on ways to address the issue through additional education and training for health professionals of all levels
IAmA,not_removed,it can in people who have a predisposition to kidney stones or are taking medications that put them at risk for kidney stones if kidney stones runs in the family then a keto diet might not be the best longterm option
IAmA,not_removed,then what does work fat shaming is bad diet and exercise doesnt work genetics cant explain the sudden change since the
IAmA,not_removed,thats fantastic while i am not overweight its really nice to see that someone is really trying to make sure that people are being treated fairly thanks
IAmA,not_removed,that makes sense thank you so much
IAmA,not_removed,oh so you want someone who experienced all
IAmA,not_removed,or someone who has been with ops mom
IAmA,not_removed,i would prefer all six but since tsunamis are really rare and unpredictable id settle for the first five
IAmA,not_removed,well ive been in a hurricane tornado and in several earthquakes so if you want to ask me anything about those feel free to ask
IAmA,not_removed,how often do i need to change my blinker fluid is it every blinks or every months i had a shop tell me they had to replace the whole headlight housing to change it and that didnt sound right
IAmA,not_removed,whats with you bastards and the coolant flush
IAmA,not_removed,have you been scammed by unscrupulous pretenders here ventury we do what we say we are gonna do it is a shame that there are predators at every facet of society dont be a victim we believe in the universal rule do unto others
IAmA,not_removed,has youre ride been over heating
IAmA,not_removed,please search first to ensure the individual or individuals you are requesting have not already been requested within the last weeks and that they have not already done an iama recently each duplicate request within a period will be removed please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,not_removed,did you cry for evita
IAmA,not_removed,although most people associate him with cuba how is che guevara thought of in your country
IAmA,not_removed,i could no avoid it
IAmA,not_removed,guevara like you say is more related to cuba than argentina in the least time his figure and his ideas have been abandoned probably because a misinterpretation of his political thinking resulted in the formation of guerrillas specially during the however he is always present in the argentinas society specially in youth
IAmA,not_removed,is that girl in the pic single
IAmA,not_removed,as two freshmen did you find the business side of things to be difficult at first did you need any special permits what gave you the idea to start this business
IAmA,not_removed,id say the best part was the experience ive learned so much more than i would have if i only had the classes creating the relationships with other business owners is something a class couldnt teach me the business landed me with an internship at a small business development center where i learned so much valuable information about the starting up of so many different ventures i had that opportunity because of my business that is the best part what blossoms out of your creation my university had me on multiple occasions give speeches around campus about being a student and starting your own business i also have had probably different students contact me and ask tons of questions because they themselves were giving speeches about what i had created i also loved how my customers interacted with the company i became a face everyone at my college knew or had heard of i could go to any bar in town any day of the week and skip the lines get free drinks get into any concert free of charge that just being some of the few perks that came along with it
IAmA,not_removed,i understand
IAmA,not_removed,love it
IAmA,not_removed,mtv still exists
IAmA,not_removed,in reference to id like to think the video was a cynical grab at clicks and publicity of course it seems unbelievable that even an organization as dumb as mtv would be stupid enough not to anticipate the shitstorm something like that might cause especially in the current cultural climate in a normal world the answer to that would be of course we did thats why we did it but who knows
IAmA,not_removed,id love to hear from them but because of the massive public outrage anything said that isnt a pure groveling apology will just be used to manufacture more outrage by drama mills blood is in the water after all and theres money to be made
IAmA,not_removed,what is mtv some alien channel
IAmA,not_removed,sadly i was thinking that too that they never intended on leaving it up just a publicity stunt
IAmA,not_removed,the teen pregnancy channel
IAmA,not_removed,i have a few inquiries ive always wondered if you wake up feeling very refreshed does someone come in to groom facial hair does anyone brush your teeth how do they keep you nourished
IAmA,not_removed,why isnt this post more popular
IAmA,not_removed,in i was in a very bad car accident i had a tbi with multiple brain bleeds i was in a coma for about a week i dont remember waking up or remember anything for the next month it took a lot of recovery for me to gain my cognition back i dont remember dreaming or feeling refreshed i woke up with the mind of a year old
IAmA,not_removed,i was in a coma for six and a half weeks after an auto accident that very nearly killed me i dont remember anything its basically like those six weeks just dont exist for me when i woke up i thought it was the morning after the accident learning that six weeks had gone by was not an easy thing to accept and understand i was the passenger in the car when the car spun seven times apparently my head smashed into the side window every time the right side of my skull had lines of fractures pretty much everywhere on the xray my brain swelled from the trauma i was awake after the car came to a stop but i dont remember much they had to put me to sleep to operate and i simply didnt wake up six weeks days thats a long time when you have a two month old at home i missed over a month of her development i simply didnt know maybe while i was awake directly after the accident but i dont remember it i was just in a car going to pick up my kids one minute waking up in a hospital room the next i remember nurses rushes into the room about two minutes after i woke up then a dr it was the same as going to sleep one minute youre in your bed awake the next youre waking up to your alarm or the sun you dont necessarily remember any of the things that went on you dont have any real sense of time passing unless the sun is up or you look at the clock i dont remember any dreams if i did i can always be pmd on this account eta it took me more than two years to recover even still im not the same person i was before the tbi i forgot a bunch of words talked funny am missing large chunks of memory had to relearn how to use silverware and a bunch of small seemingly insignificant yet pretty big things im still not at more than years later i now have a seizure disorder that gets worse as i age and have a higher likelihood of having early onset alzeimers sp or parkinsons
IAmA,not_removed,my only question was what kinds of things did you experience while in a coma or was it just kind of like perpetual nothingness followed by you coming to
IAmA,not_removed,yeah id be really interested to know if anyone that was previously in a coma experienced anything while under like a dream
IAmA,not_removed,i remember the first half of the day days before i was put into the coma emergency open heart surgery i had a very low change of survival and inducing a coma increased it by a few percent i ended up having a little around chance of surviving with the coma a little over a month i didnt even know how close i was to death the surgery itself was close to taking my life and i was on life support for the first few weeks in the coma i was dreaming the entire time it was very vivid my guess is due to the neardeath experience caused a dmt dump and that mixed with the morphine i was given for pain caused some fucked up dreamshallucinations i was convinced i had been kidnapped up until my tracheotomy scar almost fully closed and i was able to speak a little bit again i made a really crappy youtube video in early about it quality is poor but has photos and clips of me practising walking again and some hospital photos
IAmA,not_removed,i was in a coma at birth so i cant really answer any questions
IAmA,not_removed,my mom was wen she woke up she docckd likeh thith
IAmA,not_removed,i woke up in a lot of pain a few broken bones a fractured spine and so on not very refreshed at all i was however afraid of going to back to sleep for a while im female so i dont know about facial hair but they sure as hell dint shave my armpits or legs lol didnt brush my hair either i was given sponge baths though nope no brushing my teeth i had the worst cotton mouth ever and my breath was atrocious i was given a feeding tube not fun to wake up connected to one of those ill be honest i didnt even want to ask about what happened when i went to the bathroom it was one of the first things i wondered but i was so completely fine not knowing
IAmA,not_removed,wow never thought about that
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for posting this glad that you came out okay
IAmA,not_removed,it was just nothing no time had passed for me for the almost seven weeks i was out life existed for everyone else but not for me that whole period of time just never happened for me
IAmA,not_removed,i had several dreamlike hallucinationsi later figured out which ended when they tried to wake me upin my head they lasted weeks months or even years
IAmA,not_removed,thats a good question i would assume its like dreaming you either remember your dreams or you dont also would depend if it was drug induced coma then i think they would be out cold no dreams like being under anaesthetic
IAmA,not_removed,i had several dreamlike hallucinationsi later figured out which ended when they tried to wake me upin my head they lasted weeks months or even years
IAmA,not_removed,no problem glad i could provide an answer ive been asked by many people in the last years similar questions to what you posted my answers seem to surprise people i think many people thinks it is incredibly similar to sleeping while in some ways it is its also very different i can remember dreams when i wake up from a night of sleep this experience was justnothing it really is like losing time there is a similar thing that happens during grand mal seizures where i can lose time in a way time doesnt exist for me the way it does for normal people it sent me into a bit of an existential crisis for a while after recovering to know that life went on for everyone for so long and simply didnt exist at all for me its hard to explain
IAmA,not_removed,wow thats incredible
IAmA,not_removed,would you mind sharing those dreamlike hallucinations if you remember
IAmA,not_removed,sureso the main one i remember is for some reason i was travelling the world with dwayne the rock johnsonthere was several others which included me getting married and a weird one where i was young dumbledore from harry potter
IAmA,not_removed,what do you youtube about what would you recommend to another person starting out is it your only source of income
IAmA,not_removed,have you played warhawk has it inspired you why is this tps masterpiece so underrated
IAmA,not_removed,what are you doing to make your game stand out from the crowd
IAmA,not_removed,got any screenshots of your game
IAmA,not_removed,is it going to be good what will make your game stand out
IAmA,not_removed,what is your favourite shooter besides a game that you yourself have developed
IAmA,not_removed,what is it like developing a game
IAmA,not_removed,why did you decide to make games
IAmA,not_removed,how much money do you have to spend on indie games development
IAmA,not_removed,i have several experience modding games and doing levels in gtk radiant and unreal engine but there is a question that has been annoying me for a while do i really need to go to a artvideogame design school and graduate to be able to work on a team doing videogames on the area of level design if so i need to pay around per semester and if no i believe i can learn on my own since i had been around for many years without academic education but i want to go pro and i believe education is the right way but i may be wrong from your perspective knowledge and experience from first and second hand do i really need to go through school or what would be your best advise to someone that really wants to be a level designer in a project currently studying graphic design to solidify my knowledge on many adobe software and art foundation skills i had worked so far with adobe illustrator indesign photoshop studio max udk unreal engine and gtk radiant also i can draw not like a pro but i can sketch and plan for my levels thank you so much best regards jam
IAmA,not_removed,why
IAmA,not_removed,why are you using unreal instead of another engine are there specific advantages to using unreal
IAmA,not_removed,why did you limit it to a third person perspective it would really stand out as a fourthpersonshooter
IAmA,not_removed,do you personally feel there are any problematic elements with shooter games at a human level that is thanks
IAmA,not_removed,never played it
IAmA,not_removed,whats your academic background graduation how did you get in touch with unreal a friend recommended it to me and congratulations thanks
IAmA,not_removed,atom does not need you to kill you can complete missions without any sort of fight its your choice you could do it the stealth way if you want without any sort of fight
IAmA,not_removed,yep my team doesnt want to share it o
IAmA,not_removed,just seen someone else said that so is there anything else particularly exciting about your game
IAmA,not_removed,max payne
IAmA,not_removed,its great not quite as good if you work for an aaa studio though
IAmA,not_removed,because its fun
IAmA,not_removed,depends
IAmA,not_removed,it doesnt matter if youre good people will hire you if you think youre good on your own no need to go to a school good luck mate
IAmA,not_removed,hmm
IAmA,not_removed,so basically a watered down splinter cell
IAmA,not_removed,ah damn well best of luck with your game
IAmA,not_removed,its got great story
IAmA,not_removed,have you personally worked for a aaa studio
IAmA,not_removed,shit answer no thank you
IAmA,not_removed,thanks a lot for the reply but i have three last questions where you actually go to apply for a job on videogame development as a level designer from your contacts and people that you had been working with the paper you get from graduation solidifies your future better over people that does not have it i mean they have better opportunities or its just a paper thanks again i wish you good too i appreciate your reply
IAmA,not_removed,lmao
IAmA,not_removed,thank you
IAmA,not_removed,ive friends who do
IAmA,not_removed,if i were you id have applied at the studios which are in your city well having it is good yeah but what matters the most is a portfolio if you have a good portfolio youve got good chances cheers
IAmA,not_removed,thanks a lot there has been more than one person that has been telling me about good portfolios i think thats what i need to focus right now i believe thats the answer to all my problems right now thanks a lot aquilon wish you good with you carrier jam
IAmA,not_removed,thank you feel free to ask more questions
IAmA,not_removed,i think i just have two questions left to wrap things up when you make a portfolio copyrighted mods and other non original material is allowed things that i did but have link with something else that is not my property for example i did a map with a star wars theme but it is still star wars and it uses star wars textures i do have credits to the original textures for example but those are not my property is that legit or should i avoid all that kind of things and put my unique and best things on my portfolio only thanks again aquilon i appreciate a lot the opportunity you give me to ask you that two questions i believe that is pretty much everything i had to ask after that two questions i feel better
IAmA,not_removed,you could put anything youve made it could be a mod i used to do modding too for gta iv you aww thanks glad i was able to help you
IAmA,not_removed,superb if mods are allowed i think i have a ton of content to add to my portfolio by now i was worried that mods didnt counted as content for portfolios also yeah i did some gta iv rigging i never released my rigged characters but those were good for practice on studio thanks again aquilon your answers gave me a clear picture of where i need to go from this point i just can say that i can leave happy my mind is clear now thanks a lot and wish you good with your future best regards jam
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,bro wtf
IAmA,not_removed,where is the closest sonics restaurant near here
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think of ksi or pewdiepie i fell that they show off and annoying cringeworthy
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about anita sarkeesian
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever cut yourself on all of your edges
IAmA,not_removed,why should we care
IAmA,not_removed,i like you people already
IAmA,not_removed,httplmgtfycom
IAmA,not_removed,now those i know and cant stand especially pewds considering all he does is shout like a moron at everything and overexaggerate scared reactions
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know who that is
IAmA,not_removed,but you have to admire the amount of money they earn by just shouting at the camera
IAmA,not_removed,ah sorry shes a feminist gamer who did several videos on women in video games tropes heres one
IAmA,not_removed,oh i do i wish i got paid for being a moron i just cant stand to watch them
IAmA,not_removed,knawledge
IAmA,not_removed,he wouldnt the reddit would pull him apart
IAmA,not_removed,i think you forgot the
IAmA,not_removed,do you fold or scrunch？
IAmA,not_removed,has anyone ever died on your watch
IAmA,not_removed,lifeguard and wsi instructor here too whats your craziest rescue ive speared a kid back into the pool because he fell off the spring board it was almost like slow motion
IAmA,not_removed,do you have to wear a speedo
IAmA,not_removed,how do you determine if a person is really drowning or just splashing around
IAmA,not_removed,how far have you ever run backwards
IAmA,not_removed,what kind of pool do you work for
IAmA,not_removed,how long can you continually swim tallsenpai
IAmA,not_removed,are you surprised how little anyone cared about this ama
IAmA,not_removed,thankfully no haha i dont think where i work at has had any deaths as far as i know
IAmA,not_removed,hmm the craziest rescue i had to do was we had a new swim instructor bring his kids into the pool and he wasnt paying attention and somehow the kid took off his life jacket and swam out to the middle so i had to dive in and grab him doesnt seem as crazy as yours though
IAmA,not_removed,yeah or no mouth to mouth if thats what you were really wondering lmao
IAmA,not_removed,nope some of my coworkers wear one under their swim trunks just in case a kid kicks down the swim trunks while theyre teaching swim lessons though lol
IAmA,not_removed,actually when you actually see it you can immediately know the difference the person drowning would have their chin tilted towards the ceiling while the person splashing would most likely be smiling and putting their face under water instead of trying to keep it out like someone drowning
IAmA,not_removed,never really measured lol
IAmA,not_removed,i work at an indoor pool for a school they have swim class during school hours and after well come in and do our lessons and have rec swim
IAmA,not_removed,the most ive done is about an hour at a relatively slow pace but i may have been able to do more this was a while ago
IAmA,not_removed,wheres your ama im an internet troll feasting on cheezies and pizza in my parents basementama lol
IAmA,not_removed,we have kids we call the brave theyre the ones that cant swim and try to swim out to our dive well we end up being able to get them before they get out there but its still a crazy feeling how big is yalls pool
IAmA,not_removed,suppose a lifeguard at a beach spots a person drowning far off the beach is there a chance that by the time the lifeguard actually reaches the person its too late
IAmA,not_removed,swim like no ones looking senpai
IAmA,not_removed,i couldnt agree more lmao ufluffymagpie
IAmA,not_removed,haha following me around now this is brilliant
IAmA,not_removed,haha yeah we have that issue too we usually ask them if they are going to swimdive in the dive tank before they come in so we can give them a swim test we have one pool that is a regular foot meter lane swim team pool that we teach lessons in and where the swim teams obviously practicerace but we also have the dive tank which is about feet surprisingly we have to do more saves in the shallow pool because the kids swim out to the deepest part thinking they can touch the ground lol
IAmA,not_removed,surprisingly that has never happened to me
IAmA,not_removed,there is definitely a chance of that happening sometimes it could be currents that push the victim down or away also a lot of the times the lifeguard wont even see the person for a little depending on how the crowded the beach is which could definitely make it hard for a guard to reach them in time
IAmA,not_removed,thought you might like it
IAmA,not_removed,what if a person actually drowns how is the incident taken up with the life guard on watch
IAmA,not_removed,it depends on if the guard was being negligent or not if they werent paying attention acted slowly etc you could potentially get sued for a lot of money also the guard would usually have a criminal investigation along with the poolbeachetc to see if it could have been prevented
IAmA,not_removed,i went to prison in alabama heres my experience with those things yes inmate on inmate and guard on inmate consensual sex is extremely common among inmates rape happens but not that often it happened twice in the year i was there guard on inmate sex happened way more often than i thought i even knew a couple of women that got pregnant from a guard worst experience was watching the warden take a girls bible away from her an say im paraphrasing that she didnt need her bible because god couldnt help her in prison he literally said in here you pray to me i was in for burglary i was a terrible junkie back then and did anything i could to get money sex offenders definitely get talked about everyone knows who the really bad ones are but most of them just end up becoming another face in the crowd most of them are in for life and cycle through girlfriends to support themselves or make friends with the guards let me just say that i learned a lot from being there but it was extremely rough fortunately i have gotten clean since i got out and have managed to stay out of trouble
IAmA,not_removed,change your name legally before you collect it and dont tell anyone you personally know that you changed your name tell noone enjoy your money yourself
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt but these would be my answers € million big party they werent there dead by overdose or because i flew a small plane drunk i regret nothing
IAmA,not_removed,trump would be like a small loan of million trump towers rich president that i should make america great again
IAmA,not_removed,thats one of the sneakiness things i e ever heard
IAmA,not_removed,id just take the lottery raffle some how a million is not a lot anymore but for a sensible person thats your life your childrens life and grandchildrens life sorted
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt come up with it i read it in an interview with an ex lottery winner from the uk i think but im not positive about that it sounds like a great plan on paper
IAmA,not_removed,whats the rationale for changing your name before collecting it do you remember
IAmA,not_removed,if it gets reported in any paper as so and so won million dollars or even if you ask them not to report it and some blabber mouth that works in the lotto office tells everyone at the bar they are reporting on and talking about a different name than every knows you by you can keep doing your thing without your friends family or neighbors hitting you up for money basically to keep it low key
IAmA,not_removed,ahh k got it then perhaps change it back later
IAmA,not_removed,which is your least favorite power ranger and why is it pink
IAmA,not_removed,tall enough to see over any limitation in the galaxy
IAmA,not_removed,well since you answered it for me my favorite is actually the black one but even if it wasnt i couldnt say so because theyd call me racistsexistmysoginistfascist
IAmA,not_removed,you racistsexistmysoginistfascist btw misogynist
IAmA,not_removed,got me
IAmA,not_removed,were there any animals that you considered trying to film and ruled them out because the spy wouldnt have worked along that same line was there any animal that you filmed and you couldnt really use the footage for the show thanks love the show
IAmA,not_removed,hi thank you for making such a fascinating series i had a few questions placement and creation of the robots a long trail and error process happened to the robots after the series is complete wish i could have one federal funding influence or assist your work or its broadcast to audiences
IAmA,not_removed,hi thereive watched all the episodes so far and love themthe mongoose spa for the warthogs was my favorite segment along with the slutshamed meerkat how did you guys ever think of this idea were you in fear of losing any of the cameras like when the chimp stole the turtle cam
IAmA,not_removed,what are your favorite animals
IAmA,not_removed,what animals were the most entertaining for your team to watch
IAmA,not_removed,obviously the nature team is great at capturing beautiful shots of wildlife even without spies were there any moments you captured with the spy animalscameras that you could not have with other methods were they more helpful for research than production love the series and your robot army
IAmA,not_removed,what gave you all the inspiration to start filming a show like this and what would you say separates your show from something i may see on say nat geo
IAmA,not_removed,how different is it making a nature documentary for pbs than for other stations like the discovery channel or bbc would you say its about the same everywhere or does each channel require a different kind of relationship
IAmA,not_removed,what tipstricks do you have for photographing wildlife and capturing such stunning shots also i really want to pursue a career working with wildlife in the future i love animals any ideas on how to get involved volunteering opportunities etc finally squirrels are my favourite animals because i think theyre so amusing to watch what do you think of squirrels
IAmA,not_removed,what was the most difficult animal to film
IAmA,not_removed,which one of the model animals was your favorite
IAmA,not_removed,are there any animals you did not get to film for this documentary that you would have liked to
IAmA,not_removed,how many shoots and time did it take to get the right shots for the show i know this weeks last show in the series airing on wednesday may give more details but also how long did the batteries in some of small robots last
IAmA,not_removed,what do african wild dogs eat and are they more scavengers or hunters
IAmA,not_removed,on a personal level what are a few of your favorite films
IAmA,not_removed,did anyone wonder if maybe there were just a few too many animal cams those things got a little creepy after a while lol seriously though my husband and i love this series thank you
IAmA,not_removed,what would you say is the strangest animal
IAmA,not_removed,what if any safety concerns with the robots did you have to take into consideration or influenced the show
IAmA,not_removed,how difficult is it to finding funding for documentaries and stuff like this even with my favorite documentaries i often only spend like for a blu ray and thats the extent of my financial contributions seems like it would be really hard to make a business case but obviously it must be possible or awesome people like you wouldnt be here soon a scale of how difficult is it exactly and would you estimate that a lot of projects that want to get done dont get done because of it or am i perhaps overestimating the difficulty
IAmA,not_removed,when do the robots start to take over robot squirrels would be dope
IAmA,not_removed,some of the animals seemed a bit freaked out by the bots in an uncanny valley sort of way were there any animals that wouldnt interact at all
IAmA,not_removed,hope im not too late i watched some episodes over the weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it wonder if there are other applications for the spy bots that are under consideration such as research have organizationsmuseums approached you about using them who would be controlling the spy bots motions to give an appropriate reaction in facial expressions etc how did the spy orangutan appear beside the female who was sawing the branch perhaps i missed it but i dont recall seeing clips of the spy one moving any sequels in the works thanks for bringing such amazing programming to the masses
IAmA,not_removed,have you thought about spying huge animals like rhino or elephants
IAmA,not_removed,did you get the animals consent first how would you like it if animals were spying on you
IAmA,not_removed,were there any groundbreakingnew behaviors that had not been captured or witnessed before that the spy animals were able to see during this project
IAmA,not_removed,how do you guys get such amazing camera angles love the show by the way
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever spied two gay guys but fucking in a public park
IAmA,not_removed,a lot of research goes into deciding and designing the robots so there were not many if any surprises the team worked with field scientists who helped inform the team about what they could expect from the animals we used all the footage matt phil please also contribute here fk
IAmA,not_removed,good question there were probably several animals that we decided not to film because either it would be very difficult to get a spy creature to effectively film for example gibbons as they live often high in the trees and move around so quickly that it would be hard to keep up and get enough useful spy footage and behaviour or because it wouldnt be necessary to use a spy creature to get up close to the animal to answer your question there were only a couple of animals that we filmed briefly and decided it wasnt right for the show they were drunk fruitflies and fireants with personalities after comparing these sequences with the rest of the film they just didnt seem to fit into the series mg
IAmA,not_removed,yes federal funding is quite important to our work viewer support equally necessary the robots are in storage at the production company i think they should be put on display somewhere and palcement was not a long process of trial and error scientists informed us where to put the robots fk
IAmA,not_removed,hi and glad you have enjoyed the series so to answer your questions yes it can be a long trial and error process in placing the spy creatures sometimes several weeks but not so much in creating them as each one we made served its purpose well but this is why we had to research each animal extremely well and collaborate with various scientists to work out what spy creature would be best suited at the moment the spy creatures seem so popular they are attending many events and talks across the countryincluding one in a couple of months at the smithsonian institute in washington all our funding comes from the bbc pbs in the uk there is no federal or government funding or influence mg
IAmA,not_removed,it takes quite a while coming up with the right spy creature for each animal we want to film and it really requires us to work out what behaviour we are trying to film and what spy creature would work best in that environment however sometimes the behaviours we film can never be predicted like when the chimp stole spy tortoise this was great to watch this youngster play with it and take ownership of ita bit like a pet and yes i was very worried i wouldnt get it back along with worrying to myself please let it still be filming luckily he did eventually drop it and leave it behind much to my delight mg
IAmA,not_removed,the great thing about this job is being witness to and capturing wonderful stories it really is the animals telling their stories we just have to ensure we have enough spy cameras to capture it deploying the spycreateatures is always an anxious time for us pd
IAmA,not_removed,id have to say the orangutans chimps otters from this series mg
IAmA,not_removed,hi easy this one arctic wolves and polar bears also wild dogs and bats and elephants and rats pd
IAmA,not_removed,elephantsno doubt smartest animal in the world fk
IAmA,not_removed,i loved watching the otters groom themselves they reminded me so much of us washing our hair also i could just watch orangutans forever its their humanlike expressions that fascinate me and the way they look at you mg
IAmA,not_removed,arctic wolves were fascinating and entertaining to watch we were lucky to get access to arctic wolves in ellesmere island in canada they have very little fear of humans because the location is so isolated so we could observe their daily lives from as little as metres from the den the pups were hilarious to watch as they played they often got into trouble from other members of the pack for wondering too far from the den the adolescent wolves were very cheeky they would wonder into out camp and steel our pots and pans on one occasion they ran off with our portable toilet pd
IAmA,not_removed,a skua a bird that feeds on penguin eggs picked up an egg cam and flew away with it incredible shot what i found really interesting was the intelligence of the animals as they met the robots for the first time fk
IAmA,not_removed,we wouldnt have been able to have filmed a mother otter with its baby up close without spy otter or the raft of otters as they were extremely skittish where we were filming them in alaska in addition some of the footage we got from that shoot will be used for a scientist who has been researching those particular otters for many years mg
IAmA,not_removed,the team behind this series is john downer productions and this is their signature style making interesting animal cams to access unique footage they have been perfecting their craft for many years and the technology is getting better and lenses smaller too this series is so compelling it could be on nat geo but i think there is consistent worthiness to pbs fk
IAmA,not_removed,i think one of the most frequent and lovely comments ive heard from viewers and friends is that they say what they liked about the series is that it managed to film highlight animal behaviour in a completely different and unique way it captured the imagination of so many people young and old and even people who dont normally watch nature documentaries a good example of that was the langurs grieving sequencewhen a clip appears on various talk shows news programmes bbc earth reddit and the lads bible to name just a few you know that it is appealing to a wide audience in addition we like our films to discover new animal behaviour new science have humour and of course bring innovation to them mg
IAmA,not_removed,good question im the executive producer of nature and we put a lot of care in respecting our audience and providing context information and respect for wildlife if you havent noticed there isnt a lot of killing on our series because we dont want to sensationalize death and predation we have an excellent relationship with the bbc because we essentially have the same public missiob fk
IAmA,not_removed,i would always think carefully about what you want to achieve in terms of the behaviour and type of shot you want to capture once you have this image in your head then go out and get it time spent in the field and good field craft is also very important the more you observe and spend time with animals the more you will see it helps to think about their perspective how you think they might see and experience their world keep you eyes out for a good story every animal has a good story to tell it is there for the taking take lots and lots of pictures and video moments are fleeting and sometimes you dont know the value of what you have captured until much later squirrels i love squirrels super intelligent and agile pd
IAmA,not_removed,be patient learn something about your subject so you know where it will be and get a good lens a so you are a safe distance away and be quiet join a birdwatching club too fk
IAmA,not_removed,i say keep an open mind when filming wildlife if you want to stand our from the crowd dont just think about what makes a beautiful shot aesthetically but what behaviour or feeling can i capture from filming that animal in terms of getting into the business again being openminded having many strings to your bow and volunteering loads it took me a good couple of years to get my first permanent job in wildlife filming so in between all that work experience i worked on volunteer jobs in the field building up my field experience as for squirrels i hadnt given them much thought until this series as it showed them in a completely different light and i learnt new things myself and so i kinda have a new respect for them and their intelligence mg
IAmA,not_removed,hi there for me it was the prairie dogs i thought they would be so easy to film but it turned out to be a very challenging shoot they were very nervous of everything proabably because there are so many things out there to get them they would alarm at us our tripods and cameras plastic bags hats we deployed spy prairie dog close to the burrows and had to retreat far away once we were out of visual line of sight and once spy prairie dog was accepted we started to capture their behaviour pd
IAmA,not_removed,for me it was the chimps first of all you never knew exactly where they were going to travel and this would be important if we were to deploy the spy creatures without them seeing us and in places before the chimps arrived in addition they often liked to walk several miles each day up and down the hills which is fine normally but in heat covered in sweat bees and carrying several spy creatures with you and then to discover that once youd deployed them the chimps had decided to move in a different direction it could become a bit frustrating but the hard work paid off as we captured some incredible behaviour with the chimpanzees mg
IAmA,not_removed,spy orangutan because even now when i look at it i still feel like its actually going to come alive its that realistic but at the same time spy langur monkey was also a personal favourite as it has so much character mg
IAmA,not_removed,all the bots look even more real in person fk
IAmA,not_removed,spy wild dog pup i feared for him and really believed he would not last more than minute at the den but his waggy tail and play bow crossed the robot species barrier they shared a common language and he was accepted by the pack that for me was awesome orang was pretty cool too pd
IAmA,not_removed,grizzly bears polar bears mountain gorillas orcas mg
IAmA,not_removed,asian elephants i love elephants but making a spy elephant would have been an elephantine cost pd
IAmA,not_removed,the project lasted years and we shot over hours of material across the series that all had to be distilled down to x minute programmes it was a monumental operation batteries varied for example spy grub would last several days powered up but spy orang would last about hours she had more moving parts in the face alone pd
IAmA,not_removed,hi african wild dogs are very much hunters they are probably the most successful hunter in africa with the highest success rate when hunting they rarely miss a meal sometimes i would watch them leave the den and in just minutes they would return with food they are intelligent swift vocal animated and full of character fascinating animals to spend time with despite there ferocious rep they are gently and peaceful animals when together at the den pd
IAmA,not_removed,they eat other animals wildebeest they are more hunters than scavengers fk
IAmA,not_removed,just watched moonlight powerful film glad it won fk
IAmA,not_removed,the godfather i ii i can watch those films over and over again star wars ep only timeless films that i can now enjoy with my kids too friday just loved chris tucker in this mg
IAmA,not_removed,the most interesting scenes were when the wild animals first encountered the robots so for me the more animal cams the better in the future they will get even better looking and move more naturally fk
IAmA,not_removed,the funny thing is when we first started making the programme we were very weary of making too many spy creatures and we kept asking ourselves will people start getting bored with them but thats what was so great about making the series because we found that each spy creature brought something new to the series they each had their own personality even and reason for being and so in the end it became quite exciting to see what spy creature would appear next in each episode mg
IAmA,not_removed,in general the ayeaye lemur looks pretty strange but for this series i dont think there was any animal that was really strange mg
IAmA,not_removed,hagfish they can transform a bucket of sea water into slime they can tie themselves into knots their super slime is made of a protein that is stronger than spider silk they will eat you from the inside out only if you happen to be dead on the sea bed they are the ghouls of the sea pd
IAmA,not_removed,lots of effort went into making sure the spy creatures were safe for deployment many of the electronics and batteries were housed in toughened boxes when filming chimpanzees the spy creatures were disinfected with a spray to kill off any pathogens chimps are sensitive to catching bacteria and viruses from us because we are so closely related pd
IAmA,not_removed,oh boy this is a topic for a couple of beers it isnt that tough to get funding because there are terrific major donors who make large contributions to help us produce films also budgets are covered by many countries that are interested in our films since nature documentaries are universal and you just need to change the language on a scale maybe a
IAmA,not_removed,its having that refreshing fruit flavour that compliments the ham so well mg
IAmA,not_removed,no not at all belongs in a cocktail glass on a friday night pd
IAmA,not_removed,true dat fk
IAmA,not_removed,did you see that real squirrel steal the nut from the robot one those robot squirrels were idiots p
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt see any animals freaked out by them i remember one shot of the otters looking puzzled by what was swimming near to them but this led them to be more curious and swim over to our spy otter to find out more i think all the animals interacted with them in some way or another mg
IAmA,not_removed,every spy creature produces results that is often surprising reactions can vary depending on the subject but there is a pattern to how they react we always deploy the spycreatures when the animals are not around for example if they are away foraging we then wait for them to return first reaction is normally curiosity they investigate it make an assessment and realise its not a threat and then they ignore it once they are happy and relaxed around the spycreature thats when we the magic happens but i have to say the caledonian crows did not seem too interested in spy crow he was very much there as a passive observer but he did look a bit scruffy compared to the real crows pd
IAmA,not_removed,glad youre enjoying the series to answer your questions we are constantly thinking of new applications for the spy creatures and happy to hear any ideas and yes we have been approached by organisations and museums to display them so the majority of the time the spy creatures are controlled by us the producers however for some more complicated spy creatures like the spy orangutan it was necessary to have one of the animatronic creators out in the field with us so that while one is controlling body movements the other could control the facial expressions no youre right the spy orangutan didnt walk so had to be deployed by us yes we are currently working on a new series cant say too much at the moment but you can see clips and the latest news about all of our series on our facebook page httpswwwfacebookcomjohndownerproductions twitter page httpstwittercomjohndownerprod and youtube channel httpswwwyoutubecomuserjohndownerprod mg
IAmA,not_removed,we did spy on elephants in the series with spy egret and spy tortoise there are no limits though to how big the animals can be that we spy on mg
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for answering my questionsparticipating in the amamy first think it is so important for people to know how our government policies can help or limit the things we love and learn froman exhibit of the robots esp one tied into an interactive stem program would be fantastic
IAmA,not_removed,well the otter clips in one of the trailers is what brought me to the series thats awesome
IAmA,not_removed,i look forward to seeing the new and improved bots
IAmA,not_removed,we would joke that eventually you guys were going to introduce spy human haha
IAmA,not_removed,a nice okay i was definitely rating it as a woohoo yay more nature documentaries
IAmA,not_removed,what are you talking about yes of course it does dont listen to phil mg
IAmA,not_removed,well not idiots but not as cunning as the real squirrels nature is developing a squirrel film for the future fk
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the reply great series i look forward to seeing more
IAmA,not_removed,in about two years time there will be another series featuring new animal cams fk
IAmA,not_removed,that would be too scary some of the animatronic humans that are beginning to be out there now are so realistic its scary
IAmA,not_removed,as someone who loves squirrels this is exciting news
IAmA,not_removed,this makes me so happy
IAmA,not_removed,maybe that could be a new rule when making a pizza with pineapple on it that every bite must contain pineapple id like that to be honest i think another question could be does any type of seafood belong on a pizza mg
IAmA,not_removed,what was the coming out situation there im american and transitioning similarly but cant in my town because already people loudly discuss or question my gender just when i go to the store its not not a safe place and this isnt uncommon whats transphobia like in europe
IAmA,not_removed,did your family and friends support your decision
IAmA,not_removed,where are the pictures
IAmA,not_removed,still dont understand how this doesnt fall under mental health go ahead and downvote me to shit
IAmA,not_removed,so the idea is to use compressed air to store excess electricity produced by renewables wind solar hydro ect by running large compressors with that extra energy during peak production rather then batteries then as extra power is needed when renewables may not be making enough release that air through some sort of turbine turning that energy back into electricity my question is fold have to figured out how much of that energy is lost in conversation from electricity to compressed air and back again also what benefit does this system have over a reservoir system like whats just outside johnstons shut ins state park in missouri seems they are doing something similar just with out renewable power only in the pumping of the water into the reservoir in the beginning as once full controlled release of the water produces more electricity then is needed to pump that much back into the reservoir id add only as a guess that a catastrophic failure of that much compressed air you dont mention how much pressure would be as dangerous if not more so then a failure of the reservoir which happened at the site i mentioned in the early hope that all made sense and you can answer me
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think is the status now of beijing when it comes to pollution and energy use are there any improvements
IAmA,not_removed,are you doing this just so you can then kill earth claiming the greatest trophy in hunting kind i know your long con
IAmA,not_removed,one quick question earth was there long before human exist and it was filled with toxic gas for most of its life time why do you think earth does not like
IAmA,not_removed,you down with opp
IAmA,not_removed,that final volume is about the volume of earth
IAmA,not_removed,agreed i wasnt focused on that part of it because first the earth will clean itself up if we just stop dumping the shit into our atmosphere and second from what ive read we would be better off planning broad leaf trees then trying to clean the air because number one plants are far more effective at it then any system we have now and say we do make a system that is better what do we do with all the collected carbon and ok thats efficient in one direction right lets assume in the other truth being in real world conditions we are looking at more like right so if your losing of the energy in one direction and in the other your losing of the energy collected so with that large scale molten salt water like i mentioned and high capacity battery storage isnt that orders of magnitude more efficient then this edit typos point being between the lack of efficiency in both energy and carbon transfer seems there are already much better systems that will only get better im not trying to debunk or anything id like you to show us otherwise cause as of now the biggest selling point of energy storage but that seems incredibly inefficient
IAmA,not_removed,how would be removed wouldnt it just be stored then released again again how would this differ from or molten salt solar your proposal isnt a method for generating energy its a method for storing energy right now storage isnt the major problem clean generation is we dont have any wasted green generation capability right now
IAmA,not_removed,also what about failure if youve got of tons of compressed air a couple hundred thousand psi idk how much pressure this system needs to produce electricity id assume as the pressure went down so would efficiency but id assume youd have to start pretty damn high so would a failure go off like tons of tnt
IAmA,not_removed,which is about the volume of the first kilometer of the earths atmosphere from ground up
IAmA,not_removed,well that was disappointing
IAmA,not_removed,wouldnt that trigger algae and landbased plant growth to compensate over time
IAmA,not_removed,ill admit before we can even think about getting off fossil fuels we have to solve storage the nature of most renewable energy means there is always ebbs and flows of generation or in some no easy way to quickly ramp up or down production at will so right now even if we could produce all the electricity that we need we would still need a way to store some to make up from a drop in production or a rise of demand
IAmA,not_removed,as far as storage of we do have systems that can scrub the carbon out of the and make it a solid but that still means we would have to store that solid unlike plants who use it to live
IAmA,not_removed,when phrased like that it sounds like too much to be feasible
IAmA,not_removed,wouldnt the capture result in reduced efficiency how badly does it cut into your efficiency
IAmA,not_removed,it wasnt the crazy wild ride my inner child imagined it to be
IAmA,not_removed,how often are you made fun of for your hobby
IAmA,not_removed,hi blake what is your favourite doll could you please post a link to the pic tx take care h
IAmA,not_removed,did you ever like legos
IAmA,not_removed,do you keep dolls in their original packaging if not do you put them on display or keep them where they can be played with do you collect primarily new or used dolls is there a doll youve had your eye on but havent been able to get yet due to availability or price
IAmA,not_removed,whats the most valuable doll you have
IAmA,not_removed,do you plan on going to college what do you think youd want to study andor do as a career
IAmA,not_removed,how did you get into this hobby have you been doing it for a while or are you just starting out
IAmA,not_removed,hi bjd fan ex collector here my all time treasure was my unoa does it ever strike you just how obscenely expensive these dolls are even a bobobie like yours is still or so and then runs up to like my unoa does it ever freak you out how much we spend on these essentially useless items it did me ive since gotten rid of all my dolls except one pukipuki
IAmA,not_removed,can you show your collection in your proof theres only one doll which isnt much of a collection hahaa
IAmA,not_removed,what the fuck is this im sorry what the fuck is this
IAmA,not_removed,when do you plan on losing your virginity
IAmA,not_removed,are you a potatoe
IAmA,not_removed,i dont actually know anything about these dolls think you could post a shot of the shelves that would also help your proof which is just a photo of one doll currently but im interested in seeing what the different types of dolls are
IAmA,not_removed,hmm recently a friend of mine bought his daughter a doll she does yt shows with dolls hmm if money wasnt an object which doll would you buy
IAmA,not_removed,why do you doubt youll get your degree whats your plan if you dont
IAmA,not_removed,neither do i
IAmA,not_removed,its a crude way of asking if you have downs syndrome a potato has chromosomes
IAmA,not_removed,its fine i was just wondering how they were displayed how many do you have so far is there a point where you think youll stop
IAmA,not_removed,are you sure maybe mild autism
IAmA,not_removed,i collect yoyos and at one point i was at around i carry two on me at all times and i only really rotate through about six of them the rest just sit there and look pretty
IAmA,not_removed,well homeschooling is usually reserved for the mentally handicapped are either of your parents poratoes
IAmA,not_removed,kill yourself murdvac
IAmA,not_removed,theres a difference between asking someone a question and covertly taking the piss out of them youre well into the latter territory
IAmA,not_removed,maybe where your from my best friend is home schooled and hes awesome he just dosent like school much and learns best on his own nothing wrong with that
IAmA,not_removed,when to pay the college fees when and where can i register for classes
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,requests for celebrities must contain their public contact info in the body of the request
IAmA,not_removed,is the title of your movie a description of what people do in the theater after watching the first minutes
IAmA,not_removed,opening day million
IAmA,not_removed,and thats just with two dozen ticket buyersthe prices these days for tickets is out of control
IAmA,not_removed,your mother ever tell you if you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all
IAmA,not_removed,she taught me that insulting everyone is awesome
IAmA,not_removed,just so were clear apple designers didnt like sit down and decide what there were going to be emoji for and pick poop they got a list from unicode and had to implement all of those for compatibility with other phones sold in japan
IAmA,not_removed,commenting for visibility
IAmA,not_removed,does apple have any special role or are they just one of many interested parties with a seat at the table
IAmA,not_removed,wrestling fan here ive watched for years and know a bit about the ins and outs of wrestling i can answer for wwe but not really for anything else it used to be pretty heavily ad libbed and the wrestlers would only get direction on major talking points to steer the story in a certain way nowadays nearly everything is written for them word for word with a few exceptions not really as far as i understand it the producer which in wrestling is called the booker usually dictates the direction of the story the wrestlers and writers generally iron out dialogue between them sometimes vince will get involved with a promo one of the skits you see if theyre in the back room or talking in the ring but usually that is done by the writers as far as i know vince and the writers determine who is going to win and who is going to lose together there are weekly meetings for each show to determine the matches spots and the results there have been a lot of approved stories that have been a little ridiculous including necrophilia rape and vince mcmahon drugging she wasnt really drugged his wife linda and then kissing all over one of the female competitors these stories are almost always proposed by vince himself and are always kayfabe meaning that its not legitimate the writers generally will dictate the high spots in a match for example if someone is going to get put through a table and the wrestlers usually figure out the rest on the spot if youre watching two good wrestlers almost the entire match is improvised they only know whos going to win and only one or two big spots the referee is there to help control the match the ref is essentially a glorified time keeper he will tell the wrestlers to kick out meaning to break up the pin or to go home meaning to end the match usually the booker vice is in his ear calling the match the ref is also there to ensure that the wrestlers stay safe throughout the match there have been more than a few matches that the ref legitimately called because of an injury the ref will remind the wrestlers occasionally of big spots in the match if you are looking for more info on this look for the stone cold steve austin podcast with vince russo or the chris jericho podcast with brian gerwitz those are two writers from the wwe another thing that may interest you is httpbotchamaniacom along with hilarious botches of indie promotions you can sometimes see the ref calling the match or the wrestlers talking to each other during the match
IAmA,not_removed,i watch wrestling in the same way i watch sitcoms movies netlflix etc a better comparison is maybe the fight scenes in movies while you know they are staged its still exciting to see jackie chan kick ass right thats how i feel when i see my favourite wrestler perform a corckscrew shooting star press
IAmA,not_removed,how come people still take it seriously despite this knowledge
IAmA,not_removed,do you watch tv movies any other kind of theater how come you take it seriously knowing its just actors in a role wrestling is simply full contact theater
IAmA,not_removed,same reason people watch anything
IAmA,not_removed,why do people watch movies or television shows despite knowing those are not real
IAmA,not_removed,its all this funny stuff called kayfabe thats supposed to be the illusion of the fact that wrestling is real in the mid vince mcmahon effectively opened the curtain and told everyone that wrestling is a work meaning that what youre seeing is illusion and not necessarily real its on the audience to suspend disbelief and be sucked into the show think about it like magic or like watching the walking dead you want to believe that the universe or world is real a lot of the things you are seeing are legitimate often times they are hitting and throwing each other around slamming into a thinly covered piece of plywood set on some springs and getting hit in the back with a real steel chair you cant rig a steel chair plenty of wrestlers have been injured and had to retire due to concussions neck and spinal injuries or have even been killed in the ring
IAmA,not_removed,no idea entertainment sure real not quite haha
IAmA,not_removed,yea thats the thing i expecting somethin different from them vs actual theatermovie actors
IAmA,not_removed,i get that its just entertainment but i dont understand how people complain about literally every other piece of bad writing or acting but when wwe does it no one bats an eye whats different about this that it gets a free pass
IAmA,not_removed,i think this is a different circumstance
IAmA,not_removed,i knew that would come up pro wrestling is different took me out of it when i knew most was contrived of course the injuries and stuff arent
IAmA,not_removed,i know all about the latter of course the injuries and deaths were real but the work part is what got me
IAmA,not_removed,thats what it has goin entertainment value
IAmA,not_removed,i think plenty people complain about the writing and acting i havent watched in years because it got stupid as hell i never took the internet though to voice my opinion i just moved on i think that i s what happens a majority of the time
IAmA,not_removed,people on rsquaredcircle complain about the writingacting all the time its kind of like comic books or doctor who it looks really childish to an outsider looking in but if you were a part of the community and watched it for long enough you would probably get it it is just very exciting to follow a wrestlers storyline which can span years and to see them start at the bottom and work their way up to the top and even if they arent amazing on the mic and some of them actually really are you cant fake passion which is the most important thing to keep the audience engaged
IAmA,not_removed,how so
IAmA,not_removed,i think the movies and wrestling argument is a bad argument i dont know why but it just isnt the same
IAmA,not_removed,thats what i was thinkin just dont know what it is
IAmA,not_removed,why does the ama in your sign look like it says anal what got you into coding whats your favorite language
IAmA,not_removed,thats very cool where did you learn how to codewhere did you start
IAmA,not_removed,how long did it take you to develop this game
IAmA,not_removed,what tips can you give to someone who wants to program but doesnt seem to be able to wrap his head around the logic
IAmA,not_removed,the link to your game is incorrect you forgot the at the end here is the correct one
IAmA,not_removed,thats awesome im and im starting to learn c because i want to make games also any tips or things that helped you
IAmA,not_removed,this game looks cool man good luck i hope it gets green lit do your parents know how do they feel about it
IAmA,not_removed,video games got me into coding and my favorite language would probably be c because its like a tank or python because its super easy to prototype
IAmA,not_removed,i originally learned by looking it up i had this great idea for a game in my head one day so i decided to look up how games were made i realized i had to learn programming so i looked up how to do it and started learning years later im still learning i originally started with java
IAmA,not_removed,i think months and ive learned so much from it
IAmA,not_removed,hi you could think of it like a car if pressingongas true increase speed if toomuchtraffic change to route i would recommend reading a book on programming they look thick and boring but you dont need to read the whole thing watch videos online to help read others code theres a website called code academy to help thats free the beginning of this book talks all about programming and is awesome
IAmA,not_removed,youre a life saver
IAmA,not_removed,start with something small and work your way up put yourself out there have others test your game set dealines on projects are you using unity and c
IAmA,not_removed,i hear ya on python i use it to prototype ideas a lot which language did you have the toughest time learning
IAmA,not_removed,so you started when you were
IAmA,not_removed,are books really that useful i thought a video was a better medium
IAmA,not_removed,yes and im learning through a course on udemy
IAmA,not_removed,actually i think
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i love programming books
IAmA,not_removed,super cool i made my game with unity just keep at it and keep working
IAmA,not_removed,thats crazy good job i have a feeling youre gunna do some great things

IAmA,not_removed,what has it been like working with dan adelman is he as good looking as they say p edit crap my flair still says axiom verge from the ama i did with tom happ
IAmA,not_removed,was mages of mystralia your first indie brainchild or the choice pick from a whole litter of possible titles
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys first congratulations on the kickstarter campaign so far when did you first get the idea of approaching ed greenwood to write the story for mages of mystralia
IAmA,not_removed,i played the game at pax east it was amazing i just want to jump back in and try some spells i thought up later one question is there going to be an easy way for people to share spells with each other
IAmA,not_removed,multiplayer modes including cooperative and playerversusplayer could be fun with the expansive offensive and defensive spell creation potential is multiplayer something that you have considered as either part of the kickstarter or a future expansion
IAmA,not_removed,has balance been a major concern during the development of the magic system or are you totally cool with the fact that players might figure out methods of absolutely smashing the game apart
IAmA,not_removed,i would like to say that i think the game looks really beautiful how did you guys come up with so many different visuals for the spells
IAmA,not_removed,who is your favorite character in mages of mystralia and why
IAmA,not_removed,i played this game at pax south and showed it to friends at pax east so im obviously very excited for it my question is how did the idea for the custom spell system come about its one of the most unique aspects of a video game ive seen in a long time
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your hard work a spell system like this is a dream come true for me and i cant wait to get my hands on the final product do you think your runebased openended spell system could translate to other types of games if so why do you think it hasnt been attempted
IAmA,not_removed,given the great response you guys have gotten on kickstarter recently what advice would you give to other developers looking to do a kickstarter
IAmA,not_removed,i was a closed beta tester earlier this year and i primarily wanted to say im really glad you guys actually did a proper beta test rather than an optin demo like so many other developers have been doing and on top of that youve also pulled off a successful kickstarter campaign with real deliverables going from there i noticed one of the backer perks is getting beta access can you tell us more about what that beta is going to look like with over two thousand backers i imagine it will be a lot harder to structure that like the beta tests youve already conducted
IAmA,not_removed,are there tax benefits or municipal support in incorporating in montreal vs elsewhere what could they do to attract more game companies
IAmA,not_removed,is it fun to work on this game
IAmA,not_removed,was it difficult to test the game with millions of possible spells
IAmA,not_removed,would you rather fight ducksized mages or magesized duck
IAmA,not_removed,whats the strangest hiring interview youve givenreceived
IAmA,not_removed,will the revered master wizard of words ed greenwood appear in mages of mystralia whether it be a cameo voice acting both etc
IAmA,not_removed,will mom be able to be run on macs
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys what is missing for mages of mystralia to become a switch game or what would be the best way to show support
IAmA,not_removed,haha i see what you did there clever d
IAmA,not_removed,lf its an idea we came up with waaaayyy back in when we were together in university during a programming class where we met as we worked in the industry over the years it was an idea that stuck with us and after gaining the necessary experience each of us following our own path in the games industry we finally had the opportunity to bring it to life and we took it d
IAmA,not_removed,pat thanks man we appreciate the kind words d we arent native english speakers so we knew we wanted to approach a professional to take care of our games narrative and we wanted to create an entire world which isnt an easy task we needed an author who had the chops to take care of that and ed greenwood was a staple in our libraries so we took a chance lf we were fans of ed since we were kids we never thought in a million years that hed actually accept to work with us so you can imagine our excitement when he said yes i kept bragging about it to my old dnd playing friends its been an honor to work with him
IAmA,not_removed,pat awesome whats cool with our spell system is that its simple enough to grasp for anyone whos interacted with it which makes explaining spell creation over the phone or on the internet pretty easy that being said we do have ideas to help with the social sharing aspects of spells but it would be something that we would look at postlaunch lf weve had ideas for this since the beginning its pretty much a question of what features we add first at this point stay tuned for that one
IAmA,not_removed,lf in the first four months of the project this was very much in our design we even had prototypes to support this however we quickly realized that to create a game with the quality of assets and complexity of systems that we had it would take a significant amount of time and money to be able to add multiplayer we ended up deciding that it would be a better idea to focus on perfecting a singleplayer campaign much like zelda does pat multiplayer is definitely something we always have in the back of our minds but it just wasnt feasible with our budget for the current game but who knows what the future holds
IAmA,not_removed,pat hell yes i have an anecdote i want to share for this i once met with bruce nesmith creative director of skyrim and add designer and when i hinted that skyrim was not very well balanced he replied candidly that a perfect balancing does not always mean more fun and hes right i had a blast in with minmaxing characters designing op things is fun a player who ends up taking an incredible amount of time to perfect spellcrafting and breezes through hard areas of the game will have as much fun as a player who smashes through and dies multiple times using less optimal spells
IAmA,not_removed,lf we started out thinking about elements and which ones we wanted in the game then when it came to the behavioral runes you can attach to spells our artists worked incredibly hard to make sure they look amazing d pat whats cool with our system is that effects are adaptative meaning as you add runes to a spell it also modifies its visual effects it was a challenge to get to a point where it always looks great and it took us a lot of time to nail the artistic direction for the fx but we feel weve managed to reach that point
IAmA,not_removed,lf i cant really spoil who it is but its a character that is incredibly important to the sequel wink wink youll understand when you play the game pat mine is actually the first boss in the game twigg the giant wood wretch who became a kindof icon for the game it was our first attempt at creating an epic scale character in the game and it became the benchmark for the rest of the bosses who followed its also there that our animator richard had an opporunity to release his aaa skills and it shows
IAmA,not_removed,pat everytime we played a mage in a video game we never felt it was as fun as it was in dnd or what we were seeing in movies or books this pushed us to find the core of what made a mages spellcrafting special we also have programming backgrounds so the permissiveness and expansiveness of the system felt natural to us lf the unique properties of a video game compared to other mediums are its interactive aspects we really wanted to delve into the depths of this mechanic in order to reach the core of what made it fun
IAmA,not_removed,lf the hardest thing about our spellcrafting system was to make it deep and complex but still make it accessible and easy to comprehend we certainly didnt want players to feel like they were programming we wanted them to feel like they could toy around with their spellbook and reach something new each time theres an elegance in the design there that took us a lot of effort to reach and i think our backgrounds and the strength of our team helped us a lot there pat thanks for the kind words there are other systems out there although not necessarily for spells that reach a level of complexity that is impressive for example minecrafts redstone circuits are incredible but they arent easy to grasp making it easy to learn is the real challenge
IAmA,not_removed,lf our case is pretty unique we basically did it in reverse with a game far in development so our advice might not apply to everyone asking for feedback from people and devs before launching is crucial the first few hours of the kickstarter are important having other developer friends ideally whove gone through kickstarter before that can quickly spread the word really helps were from montreal so the gamer communities here are pretty strong which helped reaching out to communities is very important what put us over the top was also doing events like pax sxsw and playstation experience where we could gather feedback for the game gain exposure with players and media prior to the campaign and in the end make sure youve got a good idea and you can explain it with good visuals thats a must
IAmA,not_removed,lf the smaller beta tests have allowed us to iron out all of the critical bugs and reach a stable build that we are happy with opening the gates to the beta to over people will now help us find bugs and flaws in the game that can only be found through extensive iteration we need to make that jump in order to make sure the game is as good as we know it can be pat one thing i look forward to is seeing the data on a larger scale to help us know if the difficulty is good if some runes are being underused and other progression markers that will help us tweak design to make the game the best it can be
IAmA,not_removed,lf there are a lot of initiatives for the entire province of quebec and in canada in general as well here we have tax credits of that applies to any business in the multimedia fields which is why some of the biggest studios in the world ubisoft warner bros square enix etc come here there are also up to game development studios in quebec which makes it a significant player in the games industry which makes it easier to find talented workers with experience there isnt really any municipal support but as president of la guilde im working on it
IAmA,not_removed,to be honest its the most fun weve ever had working in the games industry so far theres nothing quite like seeing an idea come to life over the span of three years and for people to react to it so positively is just incredible
IAmA,not_removed,pat yes d not only are there unexpected bugs every other day but it also brings up balancing issues some spells were just way too strong so it was quite a challenge to make sure the game allowed all of these possibilities without it breaking the flow but at the same time we wanted to allow all of the crazy possibilities to exist in some form balancing these two aspects took us four iterations of the spellcrafting system to finally get to where we are now lf our first and greatest playtester was an excel spreadsheet thank you microsoft
IAmA,not_removed,lf one mage sized duck way easier to defeat new idea its a crossover between duck hunt and mages of mystralia starts writing
IAmA,not_removed,pat i didnt get the chance to do many interviews as an employer yet but ive been in many strange interviews in my life one of those being someone who wanted to poach me from my previous job at gameloft they offered a much lower salary and the game project they pitched just didnt make any sense xd my first interview in the videogames industry was also spectacular i discovered i was way overdressed both hr and project leads there wore heavymetal tshirts i was way too excited and the interviewers looked hangover fun times
IAmA,not_removed,pat i wish we had more of that cameos and hidden stuff to my knowledge ed does not appear in the game but people in the team are plotting something i think im sure that a few easter eggs will be discovered and spread over the net maybe one of those will involve ed p
IAmA,not_removed,lf and pat we plan to port the game to mac and linux steam eventually but those platforms will only be available at a later date well keep you posted
IAmA,not_removed,pat a lot of people ask us for for the switch version so i hope that nintendo will see that hype and send us a devkit its the only thing we need really that plus a few weeks of extra work the best way to help is to show nintendo on all social media that you want to see mages of mystralia on the switch in
IAmA,not_removed,pat samus for sure i suck at that game tho haha
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the answer best of luck to your whole team for the upcoming release ps haha yes i can only imagine the moment when you heard back from him and he gave a positive response thats awesome
IAmA,not_removed,enlightening thank you
IAmA,not_removed,thats awesome i cant wait to play it
IAmA,not_removed,what about mage sized ducks vs duck sized mage
IAmA,not_removed,heres hoping so
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the reply if i back the kickstarter now would i get a mac copy of it later game looks great by the way i cant wait to try out that juicy spell system
IAmA,not_removed,awesome will do what i can
IAmA,not_removed,depends on what you mean by mage size
IAmA,not_removed,thanks if you choose the steam key its going to work on windows at launch and maclinux when they become available all platforms use the same product key we just dont have a date for you yet sorry
IAmA,not_removed,no worries thanks for the info
IAmA,not_removed,have you seen some of his youtube interviews answers almost all of these questions
IAmA,not_removed,gettin bread
IAmA,not_removed,i see what youre saying he has a lot of financial freedom and has been privileged in many from your perspective does his protest seem like hes attempting to bring attention to his personal oppression or the oppression of black americans
IAmA,not_removed,he is so oppressed living in the first world country and being paid millions to play with an egg also adopted by white parents
IAmA,not_removed,what is the story of you opening up a dive shop i imagine money must of been an issue in a way and time
IAmA,not_removed,what is the most beautiful fish you have seen in your travels
IAmA,not_removed,fellow diver here what is the worst experience youve had with the bends decompression sickness in yourself or clients also who certifies you padi
IAmA,not_removed,what is the scariest thing that has happened to you or a fellow diver
IAmA,not_removed,what is the scariest thing you have ever seen on a dive
IAmA,not_removed,what is a tutle
IAmA,not_removed,what sight made you stop and realize that nature is really beautiful do you have some pictures
IAmA,not_removed,how many times do you get asked what scuba stands for and how many times have you had to look it up
IAmA,not_removed,any recommendations for a christmas gift for my dad who is also a master diver maybe something that isnt the norm that he could appreciate and that wouldnt break my bank
IAmA,not_removed,is there a trick to popping your ears everytime i try i get nervous that im blowing too hard and that i will damage my ears
IAmA,not_removed,i got my diving cert not too long ago and have since been to washington and hawaii for scuba diving after comparing the two i have found that warm water diving in the tropics is much more pleasant so my question is out of all the different places you have scuba dived which has been your favorite or place you would most recommend for a casual rec diver
IAmA,not_removed,you say you certify professional scuba divers now im assuming that you dont mean other instructors for the most part so what do professional scuba divers do do you do that too
IAmA,not_removed,are you trimix and what was the funnest scariest dive you did on that mix
IAmA,not_removed,what are reasonable rates to take a course and get your license in canada or north america also what are the major risk of going subdividing over seas without a licenses or proper training can most of the basics be learned in a afternoon
IAmA,not_removed,how would you recommend someone with thalassophobia get over their fears
IAmA,not_removed,have you seen an octopus have you ever caught anything down there like a fish does anyone dive in lakes or caves do people dive mainly to see the wildlife or scenery or just cause

IAmA,not_removed,are you an ikelite dealer ever been to palau truk okinawa galapagos why is bonaire your favorite place to dive i love talking to fellow divers
IAmA,not_removed,could i have a deconstruction of your username
IAmA,not_removed,what do you like about turtles
IAmA,not_removed,i am in the aquariumzoo business and hoping to make a career in either education or husbandry do you think getting certified as a diver would be beneficial to my career
IAmA,not_removed,hello fellow turtle enthusiast here what does an average work week look like for you
IAmA,not_removed,do you make a decent living doing this id love to do this as a living im only advanced but im not sure its a worthwhile investment have any openings or thoughts
IAmA,not_removed,you down with opp
IAmA,not_removed,are there a large number of scuba divers that dont like turtles who doesnt like turtles honestly follow up question i keep salt water shrimp in an aquarium they are really cool and outgoing they clean my skin and act happy to see me do shrimp in the ocean seem curious and energetic about your presence or are they more reluctant does it depend on location or time of day
IAmA,not_removed,i hear all master scuba divers have micro penises can you confirm
IAmA,not_removed,well i was fortunate in this day and age of small business startups and such i mentioned in my bio that ive grown up in the industry this is because my father is a dive professional maybe hes the one that should be doing this ama lol he opened our store in the early after spending a couple decades managing another store and now our family business is one of the oldest dive shops in the south i grew up in this store often doing my homework in the service area when i was in grade school and worked in the store after school and on the weekends throughout my teenage years when i graduated college none of my other siblings had wanted to take the reigns of the dive shop and had gone on to other careers i was the only one with a college degree yet i was the one that decided to be a dive bum for my career so here i am making less than all of them but i get to travel the world scuba diving a handful of times every year and my uniform is a wetsuit tldr inherited family business dad is the real badass
IAmA,not_removed,although several things underwater especially in clear tropical environments are almost otherworldly and thus extremely cool and beautiful my lifelong favorite has been the queen angelfish every time one graces me with its presence i cant help but stop what i am doing and follow it as long as the moment lasts i had a pillow as a child that was a stuffed queen angelfish and i always knew that fish then the first time i saw one in person it glowed like a neon sign and was so much more than that pillow ever was something about that feeling of reality exceeding expectations so much left a lasting impact on me that still captures me to this day every time i see a queen angel
IAmA,not_removed,yes padi is our certifying agency although on one hand they are our oppressive overlords when it comes to running a profitable dive business they are the largest scuba certification agency that has done the most to help get people underwater and to protect our planets oceans fortunately i have never had dcs nor have any of my studentsclients i have had a few folks push the limits of flirting with dcs and on one occasion i put myself in a situation that flirted with dcs more than id like to admit however dcs has never touched me or anyone around me and i am thankful for that two things i am incredibly fascinated maybe the wrong word to use here by dcs and i soak in every bit of information and personal experience i can from people who have had it it scares me to death the damage that dcs can do and just how little we know about how to deal with it the scariest part of dcs to me is how unpredictable it truly is we have all these super sophisticated dive computers that supposedly keep you from getting the bends yet the one person in my life that i know that has had it got it on a totally normal dive which as a diver you know how relatively shallow really is especially when talking about dcs she is a prominent instructor at the store my father originated from and she was well within the recreational limits to avoid decompression sickness following her dive computer etc but something about that day her body just must have held on to that nitrogen longer than it usually does and she got bent on a totally mild dive fortunately it was a very mild case of the bends but it just goes to show how even dive computers cannot keep you from getting bent this isnt meant to scare anyone from diving btw quite the opposite but what is important is doing everything in your power to be a responsible prudent diver and doing everything you can to prevent dcs
IAmA,not_removed,personally i have been pretty fortunate steering clear of your typical diving scares running out of air shark attack getting the bends etc although most of it is not good fortune its been a prudent diver that does not put oneself or others anywhere near those situations however the one variable that is all so enticing yet totally out of your control is the marine life that we encounter for the most part the scary things that people typically associate with diving shark attacks steve irwins stingray arent really a threat they are just a small number of isolated events that have been oversensationalize throughout the years growing up my mom fed sharks by hand every year on her birthday ive interacted with countless stingrays responsibly such a large part of it is respecting the marine life no animal wants to feel their life threatened so most marine animals catch a bad wrap when we were the ones threatening their life often like hold my beer and watch this dumbasses and they reacted in the same way we would react to save our own precious lives now to answer your question my mom was leading a group on a night dive in bonaire favorite place on earth for diving btw and she was climbing a set of stairs out of the water onto the dock apparently a box jelly had been hanging out on the rail of the stairs and caught her right across the wrist immediate intense pain set in but she had no idea what had hit her she was just unlucky to have grabbed the rail at that spot and had that box jelly graze across her wrist she was rinsing herself off moments later in a freshwater shower on the dock when she began to feel her feet getting really hot this immediately after an odd intense sting to the wrist was something bad happening so she mentioned to my father what was going on as they stood there on the dock they contemplated going to the hospital when she began having trouble breathing then it was obvious something was terribly wrong so they rushed her to the hospital still everyone in their wetsuits they didnt know much about what might have happened but the nurses there gave her enough epinephrine to stop the anaphylactic reaction she was fortunate to have gotten such immediate care and to have survived its amazing how quickly and suddenly her life could have been taken from her by a random graze of a jellyfish she spent the next six months constantly visiting doctors she had a nasty wound from the sting that festered several times over the following months and she suffered some issues headaches bodyaches fever intense pain etc for the next year or so now eight years later she has a small scar from the sting and she dives hundreds of dives a year still she is lucky and she does everything she can to prevent future encounters with box jellies
IAmA,not_removed,your mom jk sorry the year old inside just really couldnt resist in all seriousness it wasnt something that i personally saw but something a colleague of mine saw the story alone still haunts me and makes me wonder so many things basically in cayman brac one of the lesser cayman islands they have the cayman trench that is thousands of feet deep a lady had been diving all week with the store that my friend works at and on her final dive before she was scheduled to return home she started down the wall and just kept going and going and going at a certain point the staff couldnt continue after her as they would be putting their own lives at risk especially considering they were diving nitrox they said that this lady was swimming downward with intent hence why they could not keep up anyone who had maybe been out of control would have at least been actively trying to swim upward but this lady was actively swimming down the wall deeper and deeper the only thing they could assume was that this was her intent and the way that she had wanted to end her life part of me is scared to death by the thought of what it would be like if someone that i had taken diving did this the other part of me just wonders what was on her mind what her intentions where and what her experience was like as she descended to her death
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,the first time every diver dips below the surface somewhere with crystalclear water and a healthy reef its impossible not to be wowed it is truly otherworldly the corals and plantlife if you will are like something out of a fantasy novel and the first time something big like a ray turtle or shark swims by you realize youre just a fortunate observer who has stepped into the one place on this earth that is still a thriving wild place that being said we all know the terrible impact that is destroying these underwater worlds these days but when you find those places that are still relatively untouched although dwindling it is heartracing excitement that fills every second of the hour spent in that world everything around you is bustling with activity and every single inch of it is aweinspiring while youre watching a couple tiny cleaner shrimp dance around on a brain coral a wide eagle ray catches the corner of your eye and you follow it as long as you can until then you run into a turtle grazing on some soft corals before surfacing for a breath every second spent underwater in any place where the underwater life is still healthy is a constant feeling of how beautiful nature really is when youre there its impossible to not feel that sense of awe and wonder at how amazing this world is that covers of our planet yet we know so little about on the other hand when you jump in some place that has been devastated by overfishing physical damage from commercial ship anchors or coral bleaching from rising temperatures its an immediate sinking feeling that makes you terribly saddened by the beauty lost there
IAmA,not_removed,i honestly rarely get asked that question fortunately the dvds that people initially watch when going through courses explains this right off the bat but i did have to remind myself a few times as a kid in the industry what that super technical acronym stood for super compressed underwater breathing air jk selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus
IAmA,not_removed,well if he is a master scuba diver he probably already has everything he needs down to the last detail unfortunately for people in that position the things they want are usually really expensive things that are cooler than what he already has but a few things that every diver can significantly benefit from and not all divers own right off the bat light knife retractors wetsuit dive purse small personal drybox drybag etc to keep personal belongings in while on a dive boat extradifferent masks rash guarddive skin dive socks wetsuits are often my favorite thing for someone who already has everything theres a suit for every occasion and theres more than one suit for every occasion as well also a lot of times a new suit that is nicer that what they already have goes a long way as far as being an enjoyable piece of equipment similarly speaking things like rash guards dive skins and dive socks can be worn with any suit to make them more comfortable and easier to get on and often times people dont treat themselves to these things because they are not necessary im sending you a pm with some additional info
IAmA,not_removed,definitely several tricks and tips and there are several good articles online that deal with this as it is one of the most common issues with new divers yet in my opinion it is fortunately the easiest to overcome i see probably of my new students deal with equalization issues during the course of a typical class simply put most folks ears just arent used to the amount of pressure fluctuation that occurs while diving and to make it even worse during a class youre being even harder on them than you would be during a normal dive as you are often going up and down several times throughout the day the most common and effective method is definitely pinching your nose and blowing if your ears will not pop equalize it is for one of two reasons either they do not need to be equalized or there is some blockage somewhere in the system that is keeping air from passing so think about that blockage and there are a few things you can do to remove it while you are pinching your nose and blowing the valsalva method you can wiggle your jaw and also try the valsalva method while tilting your head to the side as many of these things as you can do at once will just help move whatever blockage is keeping you from equalizing now for a few frowned upon bits of advice every certification agency would crucify me for saying these things but they are truths we live by as dive professionals sudafed and afrin are cheap insurance if youve paid lots of money to dive on this one particular day by god you want to make sure equalization issues arent going to stop you so sudafed taken a few hours before you dive will help dry everything out so that there arent any potential blockages afrin comes in to play if you are about to dive that instant and have a blockage it helps to immediately open you up and get rid of that blockage ive literally had divers get in have trouble equalizing snort some afrin and dive with no equalization problems minutes later the disclaimer is you shouldnt rely upon these things to force diving when you shouldnt be diving in the first place ie when you are truly ill and beware as i have seen multiple dive professionals get their bodies addicted to afrin to the point that their body forgets how to open up your nasal airways naturally so you spend months congested while your body remembers how to do it itself if youre like most people you can blow pretty freaking hard before hurting your ears however all people are different so i do not want to condone blowing so hard that you do hurt yourself however i have found a couple things to be true when it comes to this most of the time if youre having to blow that hard there is some type of blockage that you need to get rid of first that is the real issue also some new divers do not realize that they do have to blow sorta hard to make it happen i tell people if you find yourself blowing with all your might then you should stop because thats not the issue however you should never have to blow super hard if you follow the golden rule of equalization early and often if youre having to blow super hard youve waited too long and maybe you should go up a couple feet to relieve some of that pressure youre trying to overcome you can never equalize too much so do it every instant that you feel the slightest pressure and youll find it super easy to do hope this helps its probably way more than you asked for lol
IAmA,not_removed,without a doubt warm clear water is the most enjoyable here in arkansas we often joke that the first time you go dive someplace tropical youre never going to want to come climb back in these lakes by far my personal favorite goes to two places for two different reasons little cayman by far the smallest place ive ever spent a significant amount of time at any given time there are maybe permanent inhabitants mainly the people who work at the dive operation or the one store so your whole world and community gets very small however since it is such a small place where so few people visit on an annual basis and the reefs are protected the marine life is basically as pristine as it gets everything there is thriving huge and healthy and my favorite part is every dive is on the side of the cayman trench where you have a sheer degree drop off to thousands of feet so you hang on the side of a wall and you look down and realize youre floating feet off the side of a ft cliff that is sheer and straight down as far as the light will let you see talk about the deepest blue youve ever seen in your life looking down into the abyss bonaire definitely the one place that i would recommend every person looking to go on a dive trip go to it is truly a divers paradise super laid back truly caribbean atmosphere fortunately free of touristy commercialism for the time being but what makes it special is the way the island and reefs are structured geologically everywhere on the miles of the leeward coastline the reef starts in ft of water approximately ft off the shoreline so you have the freedom to park your truck put your equipment on and wade into the water and experience the entire reef system right there off the shore this is such a special thing compared to all the typical dive destinations where you get on a boat to go diving and the dive operator dictates where you go when you go and what you do in bonaire you have the freedom to dive when you want where you want how you want not to mention all of the waters are protected in bonaire as well so the marine life is still fortunately very healthy its a perfect place for new divers because they can spend an entire dive in of water and see all the same things youd see at and its just as wonderful a place for experienced divers because you have the total freedom to dive how you want
IAmA,not_removed,to clarify we do certify other divemasters and instructors thats what i meant by that every year we are fortunate to have new folks who want to take their diving to the professional side of diving and go through the divemaster and then instructor certifications basically what i mean by professional in our side of diving is generally transitioning over to the teaching side of things what makes you a professional in the recreational dive world is simply going from rescue diver or master scuba diver over to divemaster at that point you start being on the teaching side of the classes assisting instructors as they teach classes and such once you are a divemaster or ultimately an instructor you pay dues and insurance that being the other thing that differentiates the professional side of diving from the recreational now the other side of being a professional diver would be a commercial diver technically they are definitely professional divers as well but thats a totally different side of diving with a totally different set of schooling and different focus underwater and no i do not do that aside from the search and recovery stuff that we do lifting sunken cars and other objects finding lost watches boat parts rings etc and fixing various docks ramps and underwater pumps we dont do any of the true commercial diving
IAmA,not_removed,unfortunately we have basically no need for trimix in the freshwater lakes where we primarily dive most of our diving is and up we actually stopped filling nitrox at our shop a few years back because maybe only five people a year actually had a reason where nitrox was going to be worth the additional costs however we do dive nitrox when we are traveling in places that it is beneficial as for trimix there are a few of us who are interested in the tech side of things but we primarily travel to florida or the caribbean to do any technical diving so its not something we truly do regularly funniest thing i ever had happen was the one time i experienced nitrogen narcosis all my life i knew what getting narcd was and taught people about it and various times throughout my dives i thought that maybe i felt it a little but i was never certain enough to know then the one time that i really did get narcd i knew for sure lol one of the best feeling moments of my life at approximately all i knew was that i felt damn good and i had this overwhelming feeling of happiness and being proud of myself i was extremely happy with what i had done and as i had this huge smile for no real reason btw it was like laughter wanted to just burst through my smile i was just so damn happy and as i got up to about that feeling just went away and i was back to normal thoughts after all that i could definitely see how nitrogen narcosis could get you in trouble at the time i didnt care about anything and my critical thinking totally went out the window i was just overtaken by a feeling of carefree happiness thank god i had no responsibility or real task at the time
IAmA,not_removed,well ive seen the basic open water course the one that gets you your certification go for anywhere from usd total cost watch out for any store that does what we call the cost plus plus plus classes where it is to sign up but then you have to buy your books and then your pool dives and open water dives and boat fees and rental equipment and next thing you know its to finish your cert unless a store guarantees you that their price is allinclusive make sure to ask about any further costs or how much it should cost by the time youre done with the certification im not saying that every store that does the cost plus plus plus style is out to get you but it can be deceiving another big factor is whether you are taking the course with other people in a class or if it is private a lot of times scuba instructors will be such small operations that they only do private classes and while it is nice being taught in a private setting it usually costs more however what youre willing to spend for the private experience is up to you one other factor for you will be that you will likely have to learn using drysuits if the water youre diving in is cold enough speaking to canada here that can likely add costs as drysuits are very expensive and sometimes youll get the open water certification and a drysuit certification at the same time as for the time needed i do believe that you can take someone and teach them how to dive safely in an afternoon a lot of vacation destinations will do discover scuba experiences where this is the case however for good reason to get your full certification you have to spend at least two days in class most places turn this into three days if their pool where you should start isnt located in the same place as the open water dives i do believe that two days of diving and the things you learn from the full class versus a discover experience is appropriate because once you have that cert youre essentially saying that this person never needs to take a class again and can go dive by themselves safely and those are two things that i would rarely say about someone who just learned an afternoons worth
IAmA,not_removed,maybe consider diving from the shore or in a pool first to get used to being underwater also a big thing for people whether they have any fear of the water or not is just to take as much time as you need hanging out just a few feet underwater getting used to breathing and just hanging out under the water this is something that does wonders for ones comfort when diving and is often too rushed in classes other than that i would think just generally staying away from boats initially and experiencing the water from the shore would be a good way to ease into it best of luck and i hope someday you experience just how wonderful it is under the water and what a miracle it is that we live in a day and age where we can experience it as safely as we can
IAmA,not_removed,im not op but octopus are very common to see in mexico at night i have many many many many photos of them heres a link of some of my work and the octopus is towards the bottom
IAmA,not_removed,by far my absolute favorite thing under the water ive seen several throughout my career and they are absolutely the best part of diving for me they are such amazing amazing creatures i love everything about them their intelligence is so apparent the more time you spend around them too im not going to lie as much as i love them ive surely pissed several of them off wanting to see them longer than they want me seeing them but as you interact with them its so crazy how they outfox you in every way one time i had the opportunity to responsibly hold one if there is such a thing and that instant i realized how fking strong they are holy cow that thing was impossible to pry off of me my first tattoo was actually an octopus across my left shoulder bladeshoulder i have caught several other things underwater as much as i hate to admit its quite frowned upon and i wouldnt want everyone down there doing it so i really shouldnt but id like to think ive always done it with the utmost respect and care im probably going to get crucified for saying this but more than anything else ive caught countless typical caribbean pufferfish i will say though i have never puffed a puffer that didnt swim off and seem to be totally fine for the entirety of the rest of the time i spent around it afterward that is to say i dont think that my puffing of a puffer has every killed it i do realize that it is an unnecessary action and it does nothing but cause terror for the poor little puffer so it is honestly something that i have stopped doing the older ive gotten but overall yes i have caught several things slow enough for me to catch especially in my teenage years but the older ive gotten the more i respect the idea that you should leave things alone also because that is the best way to get hurt when you threaten another animal most marine life incidents result from the animal defending itself from the asshole human who wants to get their picture taken riding that sea turtle not that a sea turtle is very likely to kill someone lol people dive in lakes all the time its actually the largest part of our business where im from as it is the closest option and we have several lakes that are relatively clean and clear as for caves plenty of people do it but it is an all too common fact that it is one of the most dangerous activities that modern man has undertaken heres my favorite video that makes me cringe i would say that most people dive for the wildlifescenery we see about of the hundreds certifications we do every year are people getting certified because they are going on some honeymooncruisetrip to some place tropical where diving was advertised as one of the cool things to do being in the south we also have lots of huntersfisherman who get certified to go spearfishing ill let you debate the ethics of spearfishing but i believe that like all things it is okay when done responsibly but to answer your question i would say overall the biggest draw for diving is the amazing world that exists underwater without it im not sure that we as a species would care as much about spending that much time underwater this is one of the many reasons why it is so important to pay attention to the ways that we are destroying that amazing world
IAmA,not_removed,being a scubapro platinum dealer we sell nothing but scubapro but for honestly the best prices scubapro is a newcomer to the tech side of diving but i truly believe that like everything they make they make nothing but great stuff that being said i do truly recommend their tech line i have sold several and really like them and if you are like most folks once you switch youll really be glad you did everyone who switches to a backplate loves it hollis is definitely the cutting edge of the tech diving industry but if you are just talking getting the backplate then you can look at whatever you want diverite hollis scubapro etc however ill send you a pm about some scubapro stuff if youre interested if you had told me that you were wanting to get a rebreather then i would have definitely said hollis
IAmA,not_removed,we are a scubapro platinum dealer meaning we are exclusively scubapro but we can sell them at the best pricing unless you are at one of the other or so platinum dealers across the globe however i do feel like ikelite makes some exceptional products that being said you should check out the new line of lights that scubapro came out with last year the nova is by far the best light i have ever used and i like to think that im pretty objective about it lol we have sold hundreds of their new lights and have had absolutely zero come back super bright super small and super heavy duty reliable solid metal and they are teamed up with sealife to come out with a new lumen light this year that does everything except dive for you i have not had the chance to go to any of those places yet but a few are on the short list namely okinawa and the galapagos my bride is from okinawa so that probably isnt too far off in the future and the galapagos is my goal i have sent several people down there and am friends with peter hughes who runs the bestnicest liveaboard for the galapagos in my opinion it is definitely on the short list its just tough coming up with the funds to get there or especially coming up with enough people who want to take a full group trip down there as for truk chuuk my father and mother had the opportunity to go dive it on the anniversary this was before they had tight rules on pillaging the wrecks or before it was common practice not to do so lol so i grew up with china cabinets full of old ink viles pens antiaircraft shells and china from those wrecks another thing that wasnt as prominent in the days that my parents dove it was responsible decompression theory they were diving single air tanks to depths of nearly for as long as they possibly could its an absolute miracle that neither of them were bent the way they tell it bonaire is definitely my favorite for one reason the freedom dive when you want where you want how you want not to mention it is still extremely healthy underwater there whatever you do if you go to bonaire dont get tricked into boat diving unless you just have a good reason for it because that is the beauty of bonaire the whole miles of the leeward coastline is a shoredive the first time we went we signed up for the boat dives like any other normal trip we had breakfast with a few folks made small talk and parted ways we got on the boat and they disappeared elsewhere when we arrived at the divesite we looked across to the shoreline and there were those folks diving with just their family and casually getting dressed on the back of their pickup trucks while still sipping on their coffee then as we were underwater we were joined by them and did the entire same dive together thats when we realized that its the shore diving that makes bonaire special ive never been anywhere else where you have so much reef totally accessible easily from the shore
IAmA,not_removed,my first tattoo mentioned in a previous comment was an octopus they are my favorite sea creature and i really wanted an octopus tattoo but i never found any art that i liked well enough one day i went into a liquor store and saw a bottle of kraken rum i didnt know it was a popular rum but i immediately fell in love with the artwork of the kraken and i wanted my tattoo to look like that so now i have the kraken tattood on my shoulder but i technically wanted it to be an octopus but its technically a kraken so its a krakenpus krakenpus is would really be pronounced like the pus that comes out of a wound right and puss like a cat is pronounced the way i wanted krakenpus to be pronouncedso krakenpuss that and krakenpus was already taken lol
IAmA,not_removed,i like turtles
IAmA,not_removed,without a doubt we certify several people every year in similar industries where diving is something they may do a lot of time the new employer is the one paying for the employees certification but it would definitely be a bonus on your resume if you already had the certification
IAmA,not_removed,the main point is to ensure that anyone participating in the activity has been taught enough and has demonstrated enough to be a prudent safe diver for themselves and for the others they may be diving with the industry still makes it difficult not impossible to do much diving without it for example you should have to show a certification card the first time you go diving with a new dive shop rent equipment buy equipment or simply get air fills dont get my wrong a person could definitely circumvent the system especially with enough money but there are so many things that someone who has never taken a diving certification course would never think of and that could potentially threaten their own life or someone elses there are also practical little things that come from this standardization for instance you can almost always dive with someone youve never met which happens all the time when you go diving on vacation and when you need to communicate something as simple as are you okay or how much air do you have or lets go up or lets go down you can basically guarantee that they will know the standardized communication symbols same goes for the more serious things like what would happen if someone ran out of air or had any type of accident happen while underwater thanks to the standardized certifications complete strangers should be able to resolve these issues in sync considering how relatively cheap it is and the fact that youre going to get to do something fun for that money too dive classes are fun not a hassle it makes way more sense to just get the certification and have the door completely opened to any diving you want to do versus always having to find your way around the system not to mention the peace of mind that you know what you need to know to keep yourself safe and handle possible problems with success the internet has been great for continued education and for inspiring people to want to learn how to dive and you can even take the actual certification mostly online now too and even though everything in a class can be found on the internet you still cant get that little card that lets you go diving anywhere not without at least proving to an instructor at some point that you do know the material and the classes put all that information in one tidy little bundle guaranteeing that the student learns everything they should
IAmA,not_removed,sounds very scary hows the diving in belize my grandpa and i might wanna go diving their next year
IAmA,not_removed,did they ever recover the body
IAmA,not_removed,i have had multiple sinus surgeries in the past and i was told that my sinus passages are pretty small so the idea that there is something in there that is blocking the air flow could be a real issue i will definitely come back to this if i try scuba again the first time in hawaii the instructor was managing of us and my weight belt wasnt set up properly so my ears were hurting i had to hold onto a rock monitor my breathing and stay calm and try to swim forward and down lots of anxiety that first trip regardless thanks for your advice im sure this will help others that have a similar issue
IAmA,not_removed,wow thats crazy i know i hear about it and never have experienced it did you dive partner know where narced at the time
IAmA,not_removed,i would think just generally staying away from boats initially and experiencing the water from the shore would be a good way to ease into it welp im going deep sea fishing on saturday
IAmA,not_removed,nice
IAmA,not_removed,amazing pictures
IAmA,not_removed,awesome pics thanks for sharing congrats on the son
IAmA,not_removed,very interesting
IAmA,not_removed,where in okinawa is you wife from this time last year i was diving on ishigaki and yonaguni im sure she knows where that is i met a guy and his wife that run a shop on ishigaki while diving in mexico and decided it was time to visit japan again ive now been to japan as far as lights goes i have the keldan luna series its a tank i do a lot of uw photography and use an ikelite housing with a canon mark camera i also did truk palau years ago it was amazing i also did the galapagos in the summer on the galapagos master it was awesome ive always wanted to go to bonaire one day
IAmA,not_removed,belize is some of the best and worst diving all at the same time dont get me wrong any time spent diving in blue water is great but honestly speaking the mainland diving that people often do on cruiseships and big resorts is a however the general rule in belize is the further you get out away from the mainland the better the diving gets simply because the environment seems to be a little better and people havent trampled it the diving out on turneffe atoll and further is all diving for the most part we are running a trip to turneffe island resort next september
IAmA,not_removed,not that i am aware of this had happened about a month and a half prior to when i was there and was hearing the story they were still very freshly scarred by the event but nothing had been done or talked about as far as recovery as far as i was toldknow the person was not important enough to facilitate taking a submersible to those depths for a recovery its fucked up to say but its the truth of the situation
IAmA,not_removed,no problem im glad that something i said could help someone else somehow thats the best part of this job as for your particular situation i think that your previous experience with diving definitely shows that you can dive even with your sinuses as they are just make sure to take some sudafed or something to clear them out before you go just to help and the thing is when i say a blockage its never something permanent usually always just typical nasal congestion hence why sudafed and afrin help and why persistence ultimately alleviates the blockage i personally had the right side of my face crushed when i was and was told i could not dive for at least months while my sinus cavity healed they said there was a possibility that i may never dive again if it did not heal back correctly however im rather certain that that sinus cavity is not perfect like it was preincident but it works well enough that i can equalize so especially if you have already dove once before i know you can do it unless something has changed between now and then obviously it does sound like your first experience was rushed though which is a shame considering what a cool place you were in just remember to equalize early and often never descend faster than you are comfortable with f those divemasters who rush down to the bottom just because they can and do it all the time they are there for you and make sure to take some sudafed or decongestant in the morning before you dive hope your next time diving is better than the first time best of luck
IAmA,not_removed,i have heard great things about that book from several people one of these days i need to actually give it a read thanks as for going to the doc its not uncommon for me or other to have a feeling of water hanging around inside your head or a sort of dulled sense of hearing from one or both ears for a few hours to a few days later then the moment that it finally clears and you can hear again is the best feeling in the world but if you couldnt equalize or there was pain definitely good reason to go see someone about that cuz that means something aint normal for sure
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure they just knew that i was really happy about what i had done highfiving and hugging them and such it wasnt until later that i told them i know for the first time what being narcd definitely feels like at the time it was my mom who was my partner and she had dove several super deep dives stupidly in retrospect in chuuk lagoon so she could identify what being narcd felt like studies show that at on regular air it is upwards of a chance for the average person to experience nitrogen narcosis
IAmA,not_removed,oh dude without knowing you this was just general advice for sure i think that is absolutely great that youre doing that in all honesty lol im glad to see you going out and doing things like that cuz its definitely the fastest way to get past the irrational part of any fear in my opinion i definitely believe that it is totally rational on the other hand to have a healthy respect for the face that we cannot breathe underwater thus a rational fear of the water is okay but glad to see you not letting it hold you back
IAmA,not_removed,thanks they are on the wall in our newborn sons room he will grow up with ocean stuff all around him and hopefully be my future dive buddy
IAmA,not_removed,man that is amazing i envy you so much ill have to get specifics from her when i get home she was a military baby father was stationed in okinawa and apparently had a thing for the local ladies sounds like you definitely know your lights now that i know we are talking photo lights totally different opinion until scubapro comes out with this new sealife collaboration they arent really a player i currently have been trying their wide light for a video light but the seadragons ive used in the past are definitely superior im totally surprised to hear that you have been to the places you have but havent been to bonaire bonaire is just such a staple for any true diver who does dive travel you will love it because of the freedom of doing what you want underwater and i dont mean this like you can go molest all the sealife you want lol i mean this like if you want to spend minutes in one spot photographing a lettuce leaf slug you can do that theres no one there to tell you where to go or what to do and if you want to go back to that one slug every dive for the next three days you can do that
IAmA,not_removed,hmmm sounds cool i havent done any diving before i am although my grandpa has been diving for a very long time haha i will be taking lessons soon
IAmA,not_removed,one more question im from florida and never dove fresh water lakes what are somethings you like about lake dives and maybe even prefer over ocean dives
IAmA,not_removed,thalassophobia is a fear of the ocean shallow lakes and streams are okay for me any deep water i try to nope out of there thank you though youre advice will be helpful as id like to scuba dive one day
IAmA,not_removed,youre not the first person to tell me that about bonaire ive got dives under my belt is pretty much every condition imaginable except ice but ive never been to bonaire ive done at least dives in mexico alone the bahamas also we just had a baby so my dive excursions will be slowing down a bit until hes a little older my wife understands my love for the ocean and doesnt keep me from going at all so i feel lucky i highly suggest okinawa please lemme know what area she is from this time last year i went diving there then met my buddy in fukuoka for the sumo tournament i have some kick ass photos very nice chatting with a fellow diver jason
IAmA,not_removed,again it is perform not preform
IAmA,not_removed,oops
IAmA,not_removed,who
IAmA,not_removed,what are you doing exactly
IAmA,not_removed,i am a digital philosopher were you able to keep a straight face when you wrote that
IAmA,not_removed,dont you think it sounds just a little bit pretentious
IAmA,not_removed,are you sure you know how to properly use quotation marks
IAmA,not_removed,im curious does this affect the alcohol itself or is it something that helps the body handle the alcohol in a different way and if it is something that does not affect the alcohol itself is it something one potentially could ingest beforduringafter alcohol intake separately
IAmA,not_removed,can you make an alcohol that doesnt turn me into a raging asshole
IAmA,not_removed,so what about alcohol negatively affects the liver and what have you done in your product to negate or minimize this
IAmA,not_removed,will this be added to brands already available or a unique brand of your own making this is really interesting fantastic work well done
IAmA,not_removed,does this change the taste and will people get drunk and addicted to it as normal bear
IAmA,not_removed,does this new alcohol affect other biological mechanisms andor interact with pharmaceuticals what about absorption of nutrients such as vitamn e
IAmA,not_removed,are there any brands using your product how do you marketing your product when is the product going to hit international market any journel or documents claming your success in it
IAmA,not_removed,could my alcoholic dad have some and not become addicted
IAmA,not_removed,what is your alcoholic drink called

IAmA,not_removed,pretty sure donald trump did an ama a few months ago
IAmA,not_removed,sociopathy and psychopathy are not valid diagnosis in the mental health community
IAmA,not_removed,also exploitive if you could choose to have a conscience would you please for the love of everything stop getting your info from tv and movies
IAmA,not_removed,wow you jump to some rude conclusions also judgemental much that question was actually inspired by a book the sociopath next door martha stout phd please for the love of everything pick up a dictionary how could i personally benefit in any way by that question apart from seeing whether someone answers it in line with what is discussed in the book its a simple question a yes or no question to someone on the internet is not exploitive at all
IAmA,not_removed,socalled sociopathy or pyschopathy have been formally retired as concepts in the recent dsm manuals hasnt stopped tv shows and movies from perpetuating false concepts however no conscience is a horrible oversimplification of several various disorders physical injury or psychological trauma which may adversely affect a persons ability to communicate their cognitive processes sense of self and others empathy impulse control or several other distinct aspects of social capacity conscience as a western cultural idea is a stoneage concept at this point the sad thing is how entertainment companies perpetuate the myth that people with mental disorders are inherently dangerous or violent this has the realworld effect of increasing the isolation of or even anger and danger towards individuals who need help support and professional treatment
IAmA,not_removed,for entertainment value people with personalitycharacter disorders do not want to be on display for you or anyone else i personally have never ever seen a question more insulting than the conscience question you understand very little about mental health i implore you to point out one instance in that book where a valid doctor in the mental health community call either of these a diagnoses
IAmA,not_removed,like i said before the noconscience question comes directly from a book written by a psychologist about sociopathy absolutely nothing in my post refers to sociopaths being dangerous or violent not having a conscience does not necessarily mean that you want to physically hurt other people
IAmA,not_removed,anyone who does not want to be on display can feel free to not answer and who the fuck are you to decide whether someone else wants to be on display or not not to mention the fact that this is the internet not real life people often put themselves on display on the internet because they feel that they can be anonymous why are you so insistent that the way you respond to questionssituations is the way everyone else will also respond
IAmA,not_removed,its an obviously fearmongering title sociopath next door the ruthless vs the rest of us a simple google search reveals that this is a pop psychologist you would get better information from dr drew on dietary supplements or maury on marriage counseling professionals cringe at this type of unscientific selfenrichment
IAmA,not_removed,look i didnt read your reply im just going to be honest here ill leave you with this having an ama where a validly mentally ill person is the subject is exploitive and inappropriate it benefits no one except those trying to gain entertainment not even those studying such people because even they know every person deserves dignity and privacy even those that society frowns on
IAmA,not_removed,i am not violating anyones privacy anyone who chooses to respond does so of their own free will people do amas about other deeply personal things which people reading are often fascinated and therefore entertained by a few years ago i read an ama from someone who grew up in a russian orphanage in the and it was very popular and also very sad do you believe all of those readers were exploiting the person who willingly conducted an ama i believe they used that opportunity to learn more about the world and other people in it we can learn a lot from others experiences whether they are mentally ill or not
IAmA,not_removed,until you get into asking people if they would choose to have a conscience if they could feel how you will about your ama request im telling you as a person the world frowns upon that it is not with the best interest of the subject in mind it is not in the vein of learning the forward of mental health the betterment of society at large of their society there is no light to shine on helpless children in an orphanage that the world has forgotten about no help for already exploited people for people the world already believes to have no conscience there is nothing to be gained here on one end of the spectrum you are further damaging people with horrible stereotypes and on the other you are giving a platform to those who shouldnt have one
IAmA,not_removed,feel how you will about my ama request but the thing to be gained here is understanding how other people think its very simple and it is in the vein of learning
IAmA,not_removed,it is perpetuating the myth that sociopath and psychopath are a valid diagnosis if was about learning you would in fact wish to learn that
IAmA,not_removed,kobe hows my ass taste
IAmA,not_removed,thom a few years ago you talked about a favorite song of yours named dawn chorus is it still unreleased or did you release it under a different name
IAmA,not_removed,are we getting a radiohead tour in
IAmA,not_removed,will you ever release big boots cut a hole skirting on a surface lift etc
IAmA,not_removed,thom what is your favorite song from the new album to play live nigel which radiohead album do you feel best represents the band thom you look like youre having a really good time on stage this tour with what looks like a little more audience interaction than usual are youenjoying touring nigel im sorry for your loss in what ways did your fathers passing influence the making of a moon shaped pool i understand if this is too personal of a question thom can you give us a bit of a background on the daydreaming video concept who came up with it what it means to you etc
IAmA,not_removed,what are the most important things you keep in mind when planning an album release will radiohead ever collaborate with another groupartist for a studio song i know stanley creates artwork while listening to the band play in the studio but has his work ever inspired a song of yours what do you prefer about doing solo work compared to radiohead work and vice versa what are your favourite new artists you havent done an office chart in a while nigel what radiohead song have you had the greatest influence on nigel who would be your favourite artist past or present to work with thom are a lot of your tweets intentionally cryptic and do you leave a lot of clues about future work on purpose fans went crazy when you posted a pictureof a window
IAmA,not_removed,hey thom will any future bsides be released the fans would love to see some unfinished material
IAmA,not_removed,what do you guys think is the best song that you all have ever done on one interview thom answered how to disappear completely is it still do you even look at all the theories that we the fans create to understand things about the albums do you like them are we getting another tour in do you want to make something with other musicians at the moment what kind of music do you listen when you are not into radiohead things
IAmA,not_removed,can i join the band i mean i dont have any real musical ability but id be really happy to be there
IAmA,not_removed,youve stated in the past about your opinion on streaming services such as spotify claiming that it was the last desperate fart of a dying corpse since then it has grown and become one of the most popular services in the world your argument is that they do not pay artists well and in protest youve pulled all of your nonradiohead work and as of today your recent album is not available on spotify yet it is available on other services such as apple music and tidal why exclude the fans who are subscribed to spotify do you believe that because of a issue like this people shouldnt be able to have easy access to your music from a service that they are already subscribed to also what is your opinion on the current trend of platform exclusivity that has been going on recently on places like apple and tidal
IAmA,not_removed,is a moon shaped pool to be considered radioheads final album what thoughts or influences were at the basis of this new record which is clearly so different from tkol decks dark is one of the highlights of amsp and even if it was unheard until its release it has some resemblance with many great songs from the ok computer era how old is this track really and could you tell us anything about its production what are the top three songs from radiohead discography that you love the most you released ok computer in in rainbows in and a moon shaped pool in they all sound as if they were made by the same musical act yet they show profound differences both in concept and production imagine that we are in you tease us as usual and then another radiohead album is released how would it sound like and do you have a plausible title for it already
IAmA,not_removed,can you actually come to scotland next time around any time after september is good for me
IAmA,not_removed,is pyramid song still regarded as the best song youve recorded
IAmA,not_removed,radiohead seems to me to be a band that makes pretty interesting experimental music and yet sells millions of records why do you think you have so much more popular appeal than other bands who make similarly strange and beautiful music do you strive to be experimental or hold back a little to maintain accessibility im thinking of bands like oceansize and aerogramme who have split up after years of hard work with little recognition
IAmA,not_removed,is this intended or just a glorious coincidence
IAmA,not_removed,can i add and
IAmA,not_removed,ok thms computer
IAmA,not_removed,yep
IAmA,not_removed,you should replace your with his a question id love to hear the answer to
IAmA,not_removed,done
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,cheers
IAmA,not_removed,im pretty sure someones done this before im on mobile so i cant link it
IAmA,not_removed,did you have food from the winning or losing team if it was from the losing team did their food suck
IAmA,not_removed,hes already done an ama
IAmA,not_removed,trump will only do an ama on thedonald dont try it here
IAmA,not_removed,its amusing seeing your questions as you obviously have the mindset of hes bad but i want to give him a chance i dont like trump but i do know that he certainly doesnt think all muslims are bad and that he will bring back jobs both of those are irrelevant questions the others are decent
IAmA,not_removed,he does not say all muslims are bad
IAmA,not_removed,as a european i would ask different question from him things im especially interested in are mostly related to international politics and affairs things like whats his plan on usas nato membership and how dedicated is he to protect that peace we have around most of the world regarding economics he seems to be aggressively wanting to protect us economics by cancelingredoing already existing trade treaties whats his fallback plan if the other parties thing differently than they do flogging the dead horse he seems to be now the special snowflake regarding climate change is he prepared to take the responsibility worldwide for his actions since this is happening and his actions are affecting the whole world and not just the country whos president he will be i think since hes presidentelect now another ama wouldnt hurt because quite a few things changed since the last one
IAmA,not_removed,he would think we would see a change of votes in the millions due to illegal immigrants voting the rise in racism most definitely didnt start after he was elected the racism and separation has been happening for a while now under the obama administration example the ferguson incident with michael brown before the facts were known he issued a statement siding with brown and even sent white house aids to attend his funeral but you wont hear anything about that literally he never said that hes already secured jobs from different companies and convinced them to stay like would you rather him be more like hillary and attack a cartoon frog
IAmA,not_removed,what the hell is a valid question or isnt based in fact is a solid question as for its so weird how trump gets a bad rap but many presidents deemed the greats are way more impulsive with way worse results teddy roosevelt lincoln etc this is just a weird bunch of questions
IAmA,not_removed,for those that missed it
IAmA,not_removed,you mean a safe space
IAmA,not_removed,strange you should compare him to roosevelt and lincoln fdrs legacy was medicaid and medicare and lincoln abolished slavery donald is trying to kill healthcare and probably owns slaves not cool next term we should post an add on indeed for president no experience necessary dark web purchased diplomas okay coloreds or ladies need not apply
IAmA,not_removed,lol no thats a democrat baby thing
IAmA,not_removed,fdrs teddy fdrs legacy was corporate protectionism domestic racism war and internment of minorities but were not talking about him at the moment lincoln abolished slavery no he didnt and the impulsiveness im referring to is starting the civil war the emancipation proclamation only banned private ownership of slavery and only in rebel states he was a white supremacist his words his goal was government subjugation and ownership of privately owned slaves which he ultimately accomplished donald is trying to kill healthcare no hes not he supports the preexisting conditions clause of the affordable care act and opposes the monopolistic statelines shit and the tax penalty youre lyingwhere did you get that he was trying to kill healthcare probably owns slaves indeed the federal government does own slaves however at least via his proposals he seems to aim toward liberating minorities from government ownership instead of expanding the welfarism that keeps them repressed no experience necessary no president has experience being president though coloreds or ladies need not apply another fdr standby sure but no were not talking about him
IAmA,not_removed,the irony it burns
IAmA,not_removed,i think given the time period both lincoln and fdr took risks to help the people and shape the nation the hatred of one candidate has seriously altered the perception of reality morally trump created a nice smoke screen with his crazy comments and twitter banter he wasnt insane just trying to keep his secrets off of the front page not qualified try working in government participating in a debate with facts even a reputable education he has the vocabulary of a fourth grader leaving all of the pending sexual lawsuits that the taxpayers will need to make disappear the charges of him being accused of assaulting a yo with a witness will dissapear slaves hes notorious for not paying a lot of people heathcare reform if approved will cause people out of insurance in our medicaid system has been used as a model for third world countries for years taiwan charges pennies a month for full health coverage not us we want to give medicare to the corporations sure government will help by giving vouchers that will barely cover copayments trump is good at cheating the system he created his own losses so not to pay federal income tax plus countless bankruptcies give back to the people so far i see a lot private organizations benefitting obama tried to get us healthcare but the republicans wouldnt hear of the government contolling it making it affordable to young people and the poor hell bill clintons economy reform included a refund to all of the american people and it worked keeping our economy afloat you want people to respect the office yet you compare trump to past presidents who actually made a mark on our history btw i fact check everything and even if i didnt calling me a liar is an act of aggression saying im wrong is more appropriate
IAmA,not_removed,not sure why people tried to apply it to republicansidk deflection i guess theyre not the brightest bunch
IAmA,not_removed,both lincoln and fdr took risks to help the people and shape the nation sure it worked out great if you were an industry baron or high government official or if you werent a minority but if you were normal working citizen they really sucked try working in government participating in a debate with facts even a reputable education he has the vocabulary of a fourth grader and obama thought there was states none of that has anything to do with the office at all hes notorious for not paying a lot of people nope leaving all of the pending sexual lawsuits that the taxpayers will need to make disappear the charges of him being accused of assaulting a yo with a witness will dissapear because they dont exist you can say those things are true but without evidence they dont hold up at all heathcare reform if approved will cause people out of insurance in no it wont even if this was the case hypothetically so what our medicaid system has been used as a model for third world countries for years which the us is not not us we want to give medicare to the corporations of course lbj designed it that way on purpose democrats are the corporate welfare party so it only makes sense he created his own losses so not to pay federal income tax plus countless bankruptcies good there should be no income tax at all his actions are heroic in that regard ps democrats and the clinton administration wrote the tax code that allowed trump to not pay his taxes in the so far i see a lot private organizations benefitting good thats the way it should be obama tried to get us healthcare no he didnt the aca was designed as a corporate welfare bill thats what democrats specialize in obama was no different and republicans rolled over on it things btw republicans created the aca in the early democrats shot it down and if youre worried about affordability of healthcareinsurance than trump is your greatest ally as he claims to aim to remove the corporate protectionist measures obama put into it you compare trump to past presidents who actually made a mark on our history of course why wouldnt he be so what is to be gathered from this article is paul ryan wants medicare out of the price gouging monopolistic hands of the government and its corporate lobbying partners and esquier opposes it not surprising but im not entirely sure what you were intending by posting that
IAmA,not_removed,because trump literally only did an ama in his safe space the term is generally far more applicable to republicans than democrats
IAmA,not_removed,no and no thats what i mean why are you calling it a safe space
IAmA,not_removed,this refers to tawan a country with an entirely different economic social and population structure great fwiw trump supports the canadianstyle system lincoln was voted one of the top presidents weve every had terrible presidents are often deemed great lincoln was probably the worst president in us history he was corporatist racist started the civil war vomitaciously nationalist i meanthere was just nothing good he did at all its not a coincidence that the presidents who are the most violent and cater most toward industry are viewed as the greatest lincoln lbj fdr etc republicans are totally against taking money out of the government i almost spit out my drink where the hell did you get this that has never ever been the case since the inception of the party shit the very first one started a war that killed his own people to strengthen government and industry bonds have you even read obamas healthcare act we dont need to were fucking living it doesnt that give you pause uh no stupid people say stupid things all the time and make accusations for publicity and attention all the time remember how there were so many allegations of micheal jackson molesting kids and there was no single bit of evidence and every witness fell apart under crossexamination there are no legitimate accusations facts and a lot of fluff that you took from his speeches i wouldnt trust anything that came out of a politicians mouth as fact neither would i however its kind of all anyone has to go on at this point for someone who doesnt quote politicians you sure are parroting a lot of propaganda and silliness obama isnt responsible for obamacare republicans are we already established that
IAmA,not_removed,yes and yes the only thing is republicans dont call them safe spaces but they basically build little shelters against having to think like fox news and then whine and bitch constantly about it whenever somebody calls them on their bullshit and claims how their being prosecuted so yea republicans mostly make safe spaces and then whine and bitch when they leave
IAmA,not_removed,objectively false on all counts but youre entitled to your own opinions or perception
IAmA,not_removed,objectively
IAmA,not_removed,so what is the difference betwen specificlly calling something a safe space and setting up areas where you never have to hear an opposing opinion
IAmA,not_removed,the earth is objectively round but crazystupid people can still be ignorant and say it isnt
IAmA,not_removed,wow you know the earth is round does that make you the smartest republican
IAmA,not_removed,not a republican but nice try retard im sure itll be a fine tale at your next klan meeting
IAmA,not_removed,lol
IAmA,not_removed,if a subreddit wont show any results past the first page or two and its an active subreddit does this mean theres something wrong with reddit with user settings with software somewhere in the middle or something else are there sites where people have thoughtful discussions about reddit where are they
IAmA,not_removed,not an ama and i cant answer your question but i would highly recommend this podcast for some listening
IAmA,not_removed,youre a legendary fan of popcorn do you still think it tastes as good as ever
IAmA,not_removed,you did really make a brief appearance on kqed friday feb at right
IAmA,not_removed,what would the aclu perspective be on banning particular subreddits if they saw reddit as a public space update i was thinking skokie not doxxing
IAmA,not_removed,is there a summary of what the interview covered update thanks that was interesting and soundcloud is a lot more skimfriendly than i had realized
IAmA,not_removed,hi narwools your post has been removed because we ask that users come up with questions that are specific to the person requested if you want you can edit the post with the five questions and reply to this comment and i will reapprove your request please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,not_removed,ok thanks for doing this i have many questions for trump supporters i understand bringing back manufacturing is an important angle for trump supporters my question to you is how do you expect jobs that currently pay an hour in labor in places like china be brought back here without things like televisions cars iphones and other products not going up to at least ten times the price so a television that is now will cost that is the definition of deflation
IAmA,not_removed,do you plan on answering anything
IAmA,not_removed,was trump your first pick
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think about trump encouraging russia to commit espionage also do you agree with this statement i could stand in the middle of avenue and shoot somebody and i wouldnt lose voters trump
IAmA,not_removed,do you get tired of so much winning
IAmA,not_removed,do you believe the polling bump he received over hillary due to the rnc will stay there or do you think clinton will regain the polling lead she had a few weeks ago
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a history of mental illness or psychological issues
IAmA,not_removed,lol thats just politician bs havent you seen the current trend of presidents not owing up to their promises
IAmA,not_removed,yes just some of these required some thought
IAmA,not_removed,nope rubio its not that i liked him its just that i believed that he had the best chance to beat crooked hillary guess i was wrong
IAmA,not_removed,i believe that he wont be allowed to do that however he will greatly increase the border security
IAmA,not_removed,trump says he wants to use it to be rid of terrorists he also wants to reinstate the patriot act if i wasnt a trump supporter why in the blue hell would i want to pose as one either you love him or hate him
IAmA,not_removed,i do believe that he will keep some of the bump but things will mostly simmer down to normalcy
IAmA,not_removed,adhd shouldnt affect my ability to choose the best candidate though
IAmA,not_removed,youd have to mentally incapacitated to vote for hillary
IAmA,not_removed,i agree with this statement
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think about the blue economy by gunter pauli
IAmA,not_removed,bryan cranston was an enemy
IAmA,not_removed,how many times do you guys call each other homer
IAmA,not_removed,how do i begin to start a path into nuclear engineering
IAmA,not_removed,has any radiation effected your body
IAmA,not_removed,never
IAmA,not_removed,navy
IAmA,not_removed,no but only time will tell on the long term effects
IAmA,not_removed,well thats no fun
IAmA,not_removed,im sort of kidding navy is a great start to any nuclear career but any good engineering school and knowing somebody can get you in the door pretty easy we hire an array of engineers civil electrical structural etc surprisingly engineers arent our top earners at the plant
IAmA,not_removed,it gets old
IAmA,not_removed,im going to do sound design i make music and i produce for artists im also an artist myself so i plan on opening my own studio in atlanta or la and go from there
IAmA,not_removed,thanks so much
IAmA,not_removed,i can do this pm me
IAmA,not_removed,i can vouch for this man as proof that he never gives up or doubts his enemy
IAmA,not_removed,thank you you are the best my friend pal manly laugh gurgagurgagurga
IAmA,not_removed,for those who may not know mike colter was the mocap artist for spartan locke in halo
IAmA,not_removed,where can i find doubleblind studies done by a noncompensated party that provide evidence for your claims about your product
IAmA,not_removed,can you show us the clinical trials and scientific evidence that supports your claim that ntx renders alcohol liverfriendly
IAmA,not_removed,how do you square the fact that bellion vodka one of the companies selling alcohol with your technology has the following disclaimer on their web site any salutary effects arising from ntx will not prevent alcohol intoxication will not ameliorate the overall harmful effects that occur from drinking in excess and will not render alcohol safe for those who suffer from alcoholism liver disease diabetes or any other disease for which alcohol is contraindicated alcohol should be consumed only by healthy adults and only in moderation so theyre essentially saying that your product does nothing i fail to see how this is anything more than snake oil especially considering the ingredients are chemically null when added at the start of the distilling process
IAmA,not_removed,as an alcoholic is this something i should try
IAmA,not_removed,i was wondering how it would affect the flavor with more subtle nuanced spirits eg scotch cognac armagnac etc since it looks like it has primarily been used with vodka
IAmA,not_removed,can this be applied into beer or wine or is it currently limited to spirits thank you
IAmA,not_removed,what is the most surprising thing you learned while working with ntx technology
IAmA,not_removed,what else is ntx available in
IAmA,not_removed,how does ntx work ie is it added to existing alcohols or has to be brewed in a specific method also while i do applaud the invention of this healthier alcohol i worry that this may exacerbate our societys drinking problem as a whole as the health concerns do act as a deterrent from alcoholism your thoughts
IAmA,not_removed,how long did it take your company to develop this technology
IAmA,not_removed,what is the ultimate vision for ntx
IAmA,not_removed,where can i find ntx
IAmA,not_removed,everyone thank you for this wonderful session i am signing off now harsha
IAmA,not_removed,is your vodka glutenfree
IAmA,not_removed,i read about ntxwhat is that
IAmA,not_removed,what is the science behind ntx
IAmA,not_removed,what is ntx made of is it natural
IAmA,not_removed,what are you doing about the government ban on ntx
IAmA,not_removed,i drink everclear proof and mix it with ice tea is this product able to match the higher proof liquors as a daily drinker this will make my doctor less frustrated with me
IAmA,not_removed,why bring ntx to the market now
IAmA,not_removed,when you put it into alcohol do you still get drunk
IAmA,not_removed,in what states are the spirits available within us for purchase what should i ask for which isle
IAmA,not_removed,how are you going to market this how does httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaltrexone affect a person also taking opiods
IAmA,not_removed,your use of capital letters and quotation marks are very confusing to me what rules are you following for their use
IAmA,not_removed,waaaaaaaaaat
IAmA,not_removed,why is the government blocking bellion what are you doing about this
IAmA,not_removed,would love to see this one answered
IAmA,not_removed,chigurupati technologies has no comments on our clients disclaimers or business policies ntx has undergone rigorous human clinical trials in various countries to exhibit the effectiveness of the technologyproduct
IAmA,not_removed,your reading comprehension is shit
IAmA,not_removed,if one is going to be drinking alcohol anywaythen alcohol infused with ntx decreases stress on the body
IAmA,not_removed,according to taste tests done by chigurupati technologies the hint of sweetness is most evident in vodka when served at room temperature and imperceptible in other spirits such as tequila whiskey
IAmA,not_removed,ntxs first application today will be focused on all categories of functional spirits ie vodka tequila whiskey gin etc it will be optimized for infusion into beer and subsequently wine
IAmA,not_removed,that the impact of vodka vs whiskey on the liver is different despite the fact that both have alcohol by volume
IAmA,not_removed,ntx is currently available in alcoholic spirits
IAmA,not_removed,ntx technology is infused into functional spirits during the manufacturing process to produce a healthier safer drinking experience ntx in functional spirits is comparable to seat belts and airbags in the automotive industry we are all aware that there are innumerable benefits to these technologies
IAmA,not_removed,chigurupati technologies has spent the past years in rd and over million to date to develop commercialise a liver dna friendly functional spirits category
IAmA,not_removed,chigurupati technologies sole objective for ntx is to eradicate all the negative effects of alcohol metabolism associated with moderate alcohol consumption without affecting the buzz factor
IAmA,not_removed,functional spirits created with ntx technology are currently available in the united states and will be available globally in
IAmA,not_removed,all vodka regardless of the source ie corn potato wheat is gluten free due to the distillation process
IAmA,not_removed,alcohol metabolization in the body increases oxidative stress damages the dna and subsequently leads to liver damage ntx protects the body by scavenging free radicals thereby reducing oxidative stress and through its antiinflammatory as well as immunomodulative properties help the liver recover faster
IAmA,not_removed,ntx is a proprietary blend of three fda ttb approved ingredients that are found in everything from yoghurt to candy and consists of a blend of glycyrrhizin extract of licorice root mannitol and potassium sorbate
IAmA,not_removed,there is no government ban on ntx technology
IAmA,not_removed,ntx technology was developed tested and optimized to create functional spirits with abv alcohol by volume up to
IAmA,not_removed,ntx technology was developed tested and optimized to be most efficacious for functional spirits with an abv alcohol by volume of up to
IAmA,not_removed,drinking is a social currency and my vision was to take alcohol which permeates every aspect of our lives business occasions birthdays weddings graduations personal milestones etc and so i dedicated the past years of my life to making alcohol healthier safer and a smarter choice for mankind the technology was achievable and we have used technology to improve every aspect of our lives and it was about time we improvedevolved our drinking experience too
IAmA,not_removed,ntx was developed by chigurupati technologies to protect the body without impacting the buzz factor this has been validated in human clinical trials
IAmA,not_removed,yup ntx
IAmA,not_removed,at present we are awaiting a response from the ttb the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau regarding our health claim petition that has been under review for the last days we are optimistic that our partners who manufacture alcoholic beverages created with ntx will soon be able to communicate the health benefits of functional spirits a new category of alcoholic spirits created with the ntx technology
IAmA,not_removed,then by all means provide us links to the qualified verifiable scientific data that contains the results of your rigorous human clinical trials
IAmA,not_removed,you have to be fucking kidding even if this shit actually reduced stress on the liver which i seriously doubt youre encouraging someone with a dependency on alcohol a disease to go out and purchase more you do realize that alcohol does way more to the body than just affect the liver right not to mention alcoholics tend to have an issue with drinking and driving which puts the rest of society at risk pretty fucking scummy dude
IAmA,not_removed,ahh i see will tell my aa sponsor about this and give it a try sounds like i can finally drink safely
IAmA,not_removed,according to taste tests done by chigurupati technologies the hint of sweetness is most evident in vodka when served at room temperature and imperceptible in other spirits such as tequila whiskey according to taste tests done by myself with my own fraudulent productseriously dude
IAmA,not_removed,then you sir are a gentleman and a scholar
IAmA,not_removed,also that the human dna is impacted within minutes of drinking alcohol
IAmA,not_removed,so up to proof its optimized and efficacious what happens at higher levels it denatures destabilizes i normally mix ice tea with proof everclear down to proof or about so thats in the range i drink normally are there any storage issues
IAmA,not_removed,youre a quack you have no credentials no science or studies to demonstrate what you are saying is true or accurate ethanol is still ethanol
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwntxtechnologycomhealthclaimpetition
IAmA,not_removed,no the point is if youre going to do it why not make it safer
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwntxtechnologycomhealthclaimpetition
IAmA,not_removed,how is dna impacted
IAmA,not_removed,ntx is not available commercially the technology is only available in functional spirits
IAmA,not_removed,all of your questions regarding the science of ntx will be found in the link below httpwwwntxtechnologycomhealthclaimpetition
IAmA,not_removed,first metabolization of alcohol increases oxidative stress this along with acetaldehyde damages the dna
IAmA,not_removed,i understand its not available commercially and is a additive to liquor to relegate the effects of alcohol or functional spirits as you call them though putting things in caps or quotes does change things basically its like a vitamin supplement for drinkers to ease stress on the liver so does it have any peer reviewed studies or can you describe how it helpsworks im doubtful of the effects as you dont answer questions directly and the ingredients in ntx a mix or solution not a technology are already found in many liquors already id love to see some test results though
IAmA,not_removed,hi furiasrevenge your post has been removed because this topic isnt suitable for riama try posting in httpredditcomrcasualiama instead please contact the mods if you need further assistance

IAmA,not_removed,as a veteran what would you fix about the military to make it better for those who served and will serve
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your service i would like to know if you are having trouble receiving treatment for your disability

IAmA,not_removed,good to hear did you serve abroad during your time of service
IAmA,not_removed,what was your mos
IAmA,not_removed,hi i hope you are doing well today if you dont mind me asking i have a question regarding your view on the veteran status in the us compared to other countries i am from finland and im being conscripted in january for my mandatory military service in my country people seen as veterans are usually the ones who fought in finland has had a lot of soldiers deployed all around the world since the there are finnish soldiers currently in lebanon kosovo iraq and mali to name a few finland also worked with isaf in afghanistan finland lost a few guys there not nearly as many as the us and uk for example but even one life lost is too many many soldiers have come back from abroad with disabilities that hinder their ability to work in civilian life until only a few months ago these soldiers didnt really have anything that resembles a veteran status here as for us veterans are those who fought in a few months ago around finnish soldiers were granted crisis management veteran status by the government because of the peacekeeping operations they have taken part in this caused a bit of a thing here because the word veteran was used we are used to only using that word when talking about someone who fought for finland rather than someone participating in operations abroad i apologize for my long storytime here didnt realize that it got that long but my question is the following what is your opinion about the way that military veterans are addressed in the us compared to countries like finland just to add a personal opinion here if you dont mind the finnish soldiers who were granted the crisis management veteran status didnt really do anything for finland but they did volunteer to do that stuff so they can assist other countries that need help these people definitely need more support from the government they are working for the government after all in a way
IAmA,not_removed,junior service member here girlfriend wants to get married bad weve been together for two years im deathly afraid of getting married and divorced what happened with the divorce
IAmA,not_removed,what did you have for breakfast
IAmA,not_removed,what is your favorite species of bird
IAmA,not_removed,just one question really are you okay i mean i know having a military career ended by an injury sucks cheesey goat dicks and the divorce cant have been fun soare you okay
IAmA,not_removed,first off you might be sick and tired of hearing this but thank you for your service and i hope the best for both you and your daughter if i may ask what was your mos and what are your thoughts on the jrotc program and the marine corps im joining the corps straight out of high school in
IAmA,not_removed,would you encourage or discourage your daughter from joining the military when she is of age also what one thing did you learn or experience did you have while in the military that profoundly affected your parenting decisions also is there a better or more accurate way to thank military personnel for their service than that standard thank you for your service
IAmA,not_removed,hi thank you for doing this ama i am currently pregnant with my first baby this will be an unusual question i really hope youll have a moment to answer it a lot of great scientists are currently researching options to reverse aging google is also involved with their project calico sens research foundation and many other acclaimed scientists if youd be given seriously the option to stay healthy and young as long as you choose to would you take it i know id do there is a current lack of options existent at this moment still the suffering pain and misery caused by aging and aging related diseases is the norm followed by death followed by forever nothingness with no reddit no sunsets no thoughts no dreams no smiles no friends and no family for an eternity thank you very much i hope you are excited as well about the progress of medicine and science
IAmA,not_removed,where did you serve w wh at regiment
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your service care to elaborate on the divorce too many of our soldiers are unable to form and maintain families and i am curious to understand why that is thanks
IAmA,not_removed,first off thank you for your service to our country just how horrible are the wait times for va hospitals is the healthcare you receive satisfactory to what you would expect as compared to a local hospital
IAmA,not_removed,there are many things that i would change but one main thing would be the va care system it does a very poor job helping those veterans who actually have disabilities that need to be treated and just kind of sweeps them under the rug i feel bad for any veteran or current soldier who does not get the care they deserve
IAmA,not_removed,not sure why you are getting downvotes your question was actually a really good question because of how hard it really is to get seen by the va thank you for your question and i hope that my answer was adequate
IAmA,not_removed,currently i am not but i am also one of the few who have a priority over others you see there is a difference in va care and tricare you dont need va care if you have tricare but you cant always get tricare the military gives you a percentage depending on your disqualifying factors when i say it is very difficult to get above i truly mean it is very difficult but through the va it is not as hard i got though the va but only through the military this means that through the military i go only a separation check but the va gave me full benefits since i did not hit the mark on the military side i do not qualify for tricare which means i am stuck with va care but i also got which puts me in a different bracket than most this is a very confusing subject and i know it can difficult to understand so if you need more clarification i can do so
IAmA,not_removed,currently i see her on a biweekly bases occasionally mom will let me have her for consecutive weekends in a row and sometimes i even get a full week of course this is completely up to her but i spend all the quality time i can with her
IAmA,not_removed,i broke my back during an airborne operation jumping out of planes there are obviously more things that disqualified me but this was the one that the army decided to medically retire me for
IAmA,not_removed,i obtained i was about to obtain my but was unfortunate enough to land myself bass ackwards a backwards on a drop zone while parachuting out of a plane i broke my back along with shattering my left hip the biggest factor towards why i was medically retired was because of my back though there were plenty of other things that qualified me to be medically retired but my back made it so i could barely stand walk or sit for more than minutes without putting me in tears i have not recovered not the least bit but i am at least able to function a bit more normally than i did before thanks for the question
IAmA,not_removed,i am actually doing very well social interaction and being with my daughter really helps but most importantly keeping myself physically and mentally healthy
IAmA,not_removed,i did did a few tours in iraq afghanistan and a few other locations my job really never required me for the most part to get real dirty but i have been attached to units that feel the heat on daily bases
IAmA,not_removed,i was a intelligence analyst
IAmA,not_removed,sorry for the really late response i cant really speak that much about other countries because i only know about veteran policies in a few finland not being one of them sorry for this but i can offer you my opinion i feel veterans should be given benefits after their service is up in any country in america for example we are given the post gi bill or other perks like this just because we served disabled veterans get care through the va kinda i strongly believe that every country should do this for the people that potentially risk their lives for the greater good of the country i myself being a disabled veteran feel like their are many people in america that do no want to risk their lives but get angry at those who have because of the benefits we earned many disabled veterans here in america are swept under the rug by our really poor system of care and it pains me inside to see this i really hope that you and every other veteran in the world gets the care they deserve for putting their country before their own life
IAmA,not_removed,military marriage is something i am very passionate about being in the military can be very stressful and having someone there to support you really helps but with this it means your stress will likely leak onto them which can cause serious issues within a marriage my marriage was a prime example of this i was gone a lot and i understand how she felt because i felt it too the difference was that i would wake up with bombs raining around my head which was a distraction while she woke up with emptiness on the other side of the bed when i came home i was tired i was fearful i was happy i was mad and i was emotional i held it all in to prove to someone that i was a man which led to an empty shell for my spouse she cheated on me and while i fully blame her for her actions i partially blame myself for being that husband who just shutdown i feel the biggest issue with military marriages is that they are more likely to fail so it needs to be worked on by both husband and wife a marriage is not easy civilian or military and both parties need to actively strive to be loving towards each other my one mistake with my exwife was that i did not wait to get married i should have given us more time to grow together before i subjected her to a life of being a military spouse i really hope that you guys work out and not just become another statistic and i also hope that my story does not deter you from falling in love with this women some people can help bare the weight for the military spouse while others collapse my marriage collapsed and it was because of how far her and i grew apart remember that a marriage is a two way street and you always need to strive to become better both of you words for you girlfriend dont think that marrying this man is going to be easy at first you both will be madly in love and feel like nothing could ever break you guys apart but over the course of a few years things may get hard deployments bad ncos miserable working environments kids there are a lot of factors that can make life hard on your boyfriend and you need to recognize that he may come home some days and just needs a little bit of time to just breathe this is not an excuse for him to ignore you for weeks on end nor is it a reason for him to ever fight or argue with you and a good way for you both to settle these issues is to actually talk go on walks go to dinner enjoy the youth and remember that you both got married out of love and not because it was something to do never keep secrets even the minor ones because over a period of years of keeping minor secrets it will build it anyway sorry for the rant and if either of you have any questions about anything please let me know
IAmA,not_removed,donald trump now dont hate me because of my choice in politics i have a good reason donald trump has outlined a very very nice looking veterans administration reform here is a httpswwwdonaldjtrumpcompositionsveteransadministrationreforms but i will outline a few things that really caught my eye ensure our veterans get the care they need wherever and whenever they need it no more long drives no more waiting for backlogs no more excessive red tape just the care and support they earned with their service to our country this one really just gets me it is already really hard to be seen right away so i am hopeful that he can atleast make it so that my brothers and sisters injured in the line of duty can get proper care he is looking into increasing funds to help support those with certain injuries and provide jobs to the disabled vets who have very specific injuries his plan is what made me respect him as a person and hopeful that he can help support those who really need support
IAmA,not_removed,a shared a blueberry waffle with my daughter
IAmA,not_removed,blue jays i am originally from the new england area so massachusetts maine new hampshire etc all have a very common yearly bird the blue jay they are very beautiful and can sometimes be very friendly depending on how patient you are thanks for the question
IAmA,not_removed,given the circumstances i am actually doing well now i wont lie and tell you i am doing perfect because i obviously have issues i need to cope with but i am doing better than i thought i would be doing at this point once i finally move home to be with my family i feel like i will be doing much better thank you for the concern and i hope you are having a good sunday
IAmA,not_removed,thank you while i do get told thank you for you service a lot it is one of those things that you just have to accept when you enlist in any branch of the military i have grown accustomed to it and honestly it is something that just comes with the job title my mos was a which is an intelligence analyst while i was deployed i actually did my job which in short is to research a certain subject get everything you can about said subject and brief it to the person who originally asked you for said subject when i was not down range i would be doing request for informations and pretty much anything i was told to do by the higher ups never anything that would change the tide of battle though not unless i was down range as for jrotc if you plan on enlisting and you want to be an officer it is a good route to go and honestly forget all the hate that comes with it it is not only a smart way to do it as they pay for everything you also get the experience without actually being in the real military yet the usmc was the first branch i actually wished to join i did my preasvab through them but later switched as they were not giving me jobs i even remotely wanted i do think the marines are a great branch and i have met many many very amazing marines i have made life long friends with them and they are all tough as nails i wish you the best on your journey into the military and if there is one piece of advice i can give its dont quit when you think you are unable to push forward cause trust me you always have more juice left in your bones
IAmA,not_removed,i am a new parent and i dont know what it will be like when she grows up but i know that her choices will be her own and i will support her in whichever direction she wants to go i will be a strict parent but only when i need to be as i dont want her life to be controlled by me as for your second question this may seem weird but when i was overseas i saw how parents treated their children some very nicely and others very very poorly i could not step it as this was not the militarys place but i can say that i want my daughter to wake up and look at me and see a great father not a dictator she will grow up to have structure manners and professionalism but i wont ruin our relationship to do so lasty yes and no thanking a service member is hit or miss some hate being thanked some love it i have not preference thanking a service member is the easiest and simplest way to do it i got my coffee paid for at a drive though by someone in front of me and those gestures are very nice on occasion i make money too and some service members actually get mad when people do that there is no right or wrong way to thank us thanks for your questions
IAmA,not_removed,its actually very awesome i thought integrating back into civilian life would be difficult but its actually been super relaxing i took months of paid leave to end my service and found myself a pretty sweet job working with a contracting agency for the government i most enjoy not having to wake up at to make it to formation for pt d
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your question albeit a weird one p if i was given the opportunity to live for as long as i choose without any adverse effects on my person i would do it to a point the idea of having a lifetime to do the things that i cant do in one lifetime would be an amazing gift i have lost a lot over these past years and health is one of them if i could gain back my state of being healthy i would make the most of it this question is a rather difficult one though but i hope i answered it to your liking thanks for the question
IAmA,not_removed,i was stationed in ft bragg beyond this i am going to keep my units and where exactly i was deployed a secrete sorry for that thank you for your question though
IAmA,not_removed,not specifically money no but trust me when i say if you are around me and my buddies you will be more confused with our made up lingo than a japanese only speaker on wall street
IAmA,not_removed,good question and so much truth behind your words my exwife and i were actually a pretty normal couple but about months back late decemberearly january she began acting weird leaving home the moment i got back from work and staying out till really late at nightearly morning at first i did not question it but later began asking her about it she got very defensive and threatened to leave me i loved her and to this day love her but when i had found out that she had been cheating on me with other men i could not stand looking at the person i love any longer i tried to make it work out between us but she was not being reasonable and blamed me for everything so i chose to be miserable for a few years so that i can be happier in the future the thing about military spouses is that it is hard by no means is it easy to be alone at home for months as a time without hearing from your husband or wife this is not me justifying her actions it is me recognizing that its hard and should be reason for the military to offer their service members more time with their families i wish i could have changed it all before it happened but i do not regret leaving i will say that when a military member is on deployment the hardest part is just being away keeping that in mind i served many times overseas and never once did i want to cheat on my exwife nor did i ever i loved her and this should work both ways if you truly love someone cheating is not even a thought
IAmA,not_removed,oh the good ol va facilities honestly it really just depends on where you are if you go somewhere like ftbragg nc you should expect to wait a really long time to be seen as there are many veterans and soldiers waiting to be seen if you go to somewhere further away from big bases you can expect pretty quick returns when it comes to appointments or just being seen if this does not answer your question let me know and i will go into further detail
IAmA,not_removed,going through my rounds with the va for years now as my life has crumbled around my ears due to ptsd and all the crap that comes with
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your detailed answer i dont understand how it works but from your reply i gather youre not receiving treatment sorry im confused on how vet healthcare works
IAmA,not_removed,what do you take for the pain
IAmA,not_removed,now i want one too but im dieting currently i shouldnt have asked stupid me
IAmA,not_removed,or insanely aggressive
IAmA,not_removed,hey thanks for the detailed response if i may also ask why did you want to serve in the first place was it because of patriotism
IAmA,not_removed,best wishes on your parenting journey and a healthy recovery
IAmA,not_removed,thank you very much for your answer and for your honesty peter thiel spoke beautifully about this this is a video from him that inspired me a lot
IAmA,not_removed,what would you want to change what do you need not to be intrusive but you never know what or who is out there
IAmA,not_removed,i am sorry to hear that and i hope the va changes soon to help those such as yourself who desperately need it best of luck
IAmA,not_removed,no p i am receiving treatment what i was saying is va care treatment is really really bad its slow and can sometimes take months to be seen for something tricare treatment is pretty nice and is accepted at most hospitals and clinics which means you can be seen same day i have it nice though because since i got i am able to be seen by most hospitals and clinics even though i am using va care while others who have va care may have to wait months before being seen its a very sad system and does not make sense to you or to me it needs to be fixed and it needs to be fixed soon sorry for the confusion
IAmA,not_removed,i actually dont i was prescribed many different types of drugs but i have chosen at the moment to remain drug free it hurts though i cant sleep and if i do sleep i wake up throughout the night in a butt load of pain i am doing this because i am hopeful that i will recover and i dont want myself to become addicted to anything as i already know i have an addictive personality thank you for your question if you have any follow ups feel free to ask
IAmA,not_removed,d
IAmA,not_removed,no problem of course you can ask more questions as many as you want a prat of me wanted to join for patriotism a part of me wanted to join for the benefits a part of me wanted to join because of family filled military background and a part of me wanted to just experience it honestly though my driving factor to enlisting was because of patriotism i love my country above all else minus family it was either the military or the police force and i chose the military
IAmA,not_removed,thanks a bunch and thanks for the question
IAmA,not_removed,d i will watch it
IAmA,not_removed,same to you brother
IAmA,not_removed,ohh ok i understand your original reply now im glad youre receiving treatment and it makes me terribly sad that many vets have to wait months to be seen its unfair and it doesnt make any sense
IAmA,not_removed,go to the er at your va tell them whatever the issue is youve been waiting to get seen about theyll take your vitals and if your doc is in the building theyll send you up to see him you might have to wait an hour or more but i dont know anyone who hasnt gotten squeezed in to see their doc if they do that also you can just walk into literally any emergency room in the country to get seen and youve got hrs after being admitted to notify the va and they pay for everything im a disabled vet and so is my dad i know a lot of others as well in my experience everyone thats complains about the va are just not being proactive yes theyre busy but if you just accept it when they tell you it will be months then it will be months hate to say it but stop being a bitch and youll get treatment
IAmA,not_removed,i would try smoking marijuana vice did a good documentary on veterans smoking weed to cope with their ptsd
IAmA,not_removed,you sir have my complete respects theni think you also read my mind
IAmA,not_removed,exactly this system is broken and it hurts me to see other veterans die because of this system everyday there are veterans that need care but are being kicked to the curb by the va
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think faking an injury is what is going to help anyone out this is the type of stuff that hurts the veterans that need care because of the already long waits i really hope you both are actually going in for actual injuries and not being the ones who leach off the system for money and abuse the er system just to cut the line
IAmA,not_removed,sadly i cannot atleast not right now i still hold a job within the government and so i have to abide by their rules trust me when i say that when i am able to i will
IAmA,not_removed,d good to hear it glad i could help you out
IAmA,not_removed,faking no one said anything about faking you said you need treatment and cant get it go to the er then if you dont have an injury then what do you need treatment for
IAmA,not_removed,going to the emergency room is for serious issues and not just because my back hurts in the morning and i just want some medication this process is meant for standard va facilities that you are obviously just skipping over so that you can get a dose set of percocet i on the other hand wait in line like the thousands of other veterans so that i can be seen by my provider and not abuse the system keep yourself company with your father because if donald j trump becomes our next president you are the type of person he is going to be targeting but have no fear he wont kick you out no he will actually make it easier for the rest of us and yourself to be seen by the va clinics so that the lines that are being created by people like you will be nothing more than a few people waiting at any time
IAmA,not_removed,going to the emergency room is for serious issues and not just because my back hurts in the morning and i just want some medication this process is meant for standard va facilities that you are obviously just skipping over so that you can get a dose set of percocet what if your back is messed up then you should already have all your prescriptions you can call in your refill over the phone or even just have it automatically mailed to you you dont seem to have even a basic understanding of the va system i dont even think youre a vet at this point you didnt even provide proof for this how hard is it to take a pic of your va card with the name and pic covered edit looked at your main post again your proof is just a pic of some guy in uniform then a pic of the same guy holding up a phone that has had a username written on it after the pic was taken hope pretending to be a disabled vet makes you feel special you piece of shit
IAmA,not_removed,oh my you truly are an incompetent one my lack of better judgement had me even arguing with someone like you in the first place
IAmA,not_removed,i see your certificate says hawaii are you ready for rimpac
IAmA,not_removed,what is the most bizarre thing you saw in the sea
IAmA,not_removed,not saw but heard a radio call in the arabian gulf the caller kept saying filipino monkey
IAmA,not_removed,knot is usually taken to mean speed nautical miles per hour and not distance
IAmA,not_removed,knots is a unit of speed nautical miles is normally the mariners way to measure distance
IAmA,not_removed,so he kept saying kept saying filipino monkey second question are you required to maintain even a sliver of attention to detail for your job thirdly if sowhy are you unable to demonstrate such attention to detail for this thread lastlydoes a qualification mean that you are in the community or mearly that youve qualified out of some school what if i were in the army and qualified as a sniper am i a sniper if yes does this make everyone with a doctorate a doctor im so confused cool story anyway love ps its obvious this guy was actually in the navy because the first thing he did as a new reddit user was respond several times to a hooters girl ama and then proceeded to brag about serving by starting an ama good game dude youre a true professional warrior ill bet that you etsed like years ago
IAmA,not_removed,you know much of this information is available on rpolyamory
IAmA,not_removed,my questions whats your favorite activity to do together board games whats your favorite memory you have of your polyamorous relationship this question is illogical it refers to a single relationship polyamory by definition is plural unless op has a very specific model of poly in mind how are the financials dealt with when there are children im snipped parents are responsible for their own children what are the ground rules for your relationship that varies depending on the relationship dont be an asshole what did your parents say she called me a ladies man and winked
IAmA,not_removed,exactly no one person can speak for the experiences of all polyamorous people
IAmA,not_removed,this is like asking someone with siblings to speak for the collective experience of anyone whos ever had at least one sibling
IAmA,not_removed,how did you go from being an engineer to becoming a businessman
IAmA,not_removed,with the increase in cad being used in pcb programs do you see an eventual merge with mechanical engineering packages such as solidworkspcbworks
IAmA,not_removed,whats day to day like being an engineer in a business field do you still get to use your technical abilities
IAmA,not_removed,as a person that now works in business who used to be an engineer this sort of thing is exetremly common my fiancees mom works as a commodities trader and she works with guys that used to be engineers engineering pay starts off good but the growth just isnt there
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys i love the curious expedition good luck with the release whats a funny unexpected thing that happened because of the procedural generation how do you keep things from appearing too random
IAmA,not_removed,what was your main inspiration when you choose the theme of the game
IAmA,not_removed,what was your primary way of reaching gamers do you recommend any way of reaching your audience over others
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for doing this im a current cs major doing some minor game development with a local company for a client and i hope one day to have some glimpse of the more commercial games industry so that said i have a couple specific questions to what degree would you say you owe your indie success to connections in the aaa dev sphere past experience in general andor luck how did you guys handle the art did you have past experience with it learn it for the game or have someone else help out do you think it would have been feasible to do what youre doing without leaving your old jobs or are the demands of your current game too great not to work on it fulltime
IAmA,not_removed,what advices would you give to people who wants to make games
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys thanks for doing this always nice to see devs trying to share some wisdom what are things you wish youd knew before starting this particular project good luck with future projects
IAmA,not_removed,hey i recorded a lot of your game first off congrats on cant wait to get back into the game and get some more videos out of the release my question is how helpful is it when people record your game and upload it and how did it feel to start seeing videos of the game
IAmA,not_removed,how did you survive monetarily for years talking about equipment software licences company paperwork legal and of course living expenses
IAmA,not_removed,did you find working in an indie development environment to be more or less stressful than aaa on one hand youd be able to set your own schedule and dont have to answer to anyone but on the other you have no stable income and are more at risk if the project fails
IAmA,not_removed,when releasing something via early access how you define how do you decide when you have reached the point where you can say this version of the game is complete whereas the previous was incomplete
IAmA,not_removed,why choose curious expeditions arty style and game mechanics one would assume you had dozens ideas floating around right
IAmA,not_removed,how did you handle outsourcing assets assuming you did did you go for local talent or from the internet in general
IAmA,not_removed,whats it like to actually produce a game that meets the early access promises have other developers personally reached out to curse your name followup if you ever produce a game that fails to do so will you promise to live stream your own suicide
IAmA,not_removed,what where the risks of making this particular game did you take these risks in account for the health of the company or made something out of passion and if it made money icing on the cake
IAmA,not_removed,any gamingrelated events that gave you a significant boost of followers what about an article youtubers perhaps
IAmA,not_removed,hey guys just saw your twitter post retweeted by inbetweengames and im really interested to check out the curious expedition i said the same thing to the twitter of inbetweengames but im still disappointed that yager didnt get to finish dead island i doubt theres much you can talk about when it comes to your work on so ill refrain from asking anything referring to that i would like to ask however which do you prefer indie game development or aaa game development also just wanted to say that spec ops the line is seriously one of my favorite game stories ever
IAmA,not_removed,with what hardware did you do the update videos with
IAmA,not_removed,how did you meet each other decide to start a business together love at first sight d or luck
IAmA,not_removed,are you happy for fellow indies hello games and how many copies they sold with no mans sky do you think they will get over their loss of reputation
IAmA,not_removed,how did you fund your development preearly access release if i really burnt through my savings i could probably fund myself for months but im not even sure id have something to show for it after all of that to recoup my losses as much as id like to make my own game with total creative control
IAmA,not_removed,heya first wanted to say i love the game i got it pretty much as soon as many a true nerd did his first video on the game and ive played it since what ive been wondering as someone whos annoyingly unable to afford it what is the process you used with making custom explorers i love it as an incentive i was just curious how you decided which perks would best fit a character
IAmA,not_removed,would you let a third party digital distributor other than steam itself distribute your product i mean lets say if an ecommerce store from india or russia wants to sell your product would you let that happen what comes to your mind as you hear these proposals
IAmA,not_removed,how did moving from a aaa to indie effect or hurt your ability to get exposure for your game what are some of the venues that you found brought you success in getting the word out that any indie dev can make use of
IAmA,not_removed,how did you first get your foot in the door to becoming a game developer and what advice would you give to someone wanting to do the same
IAmA,not_removed,what has been the most difficult thing about getting accustommed to moving from aaa to indie what are the perks
IAmA,not_removed,hello so i just started going to ucsc and im majoring in computer science game design the bachelor of science version i gone for one year and so far just took programming classes nothing related to making games over that year i applied to internship but realized i didnt meet the requirements that they wanted cause if was my first time programming over summer i didnt program once and i fucked up i realize that lesson learned i got two more years to go and i dont plan to fuck those up anymore i want to work in the videogame industry after im donewith a group of friends then open our own company just like you so i was just wondering do you have any advice for me something i can do to have a shot of getting internships or just advice in general any areas i should look into or languages i should look at and a good place to look at thank you for the ama its awesome what you guys are doing i want to do the same thing as you guys
IAmA,not_removed,simple question what did you guys made the game with
IAmA,not_removed,how difficult was it to sell the concept of spec ops the line to a publisher when playing the game i was honestly surprised that a big publisher would take this kind of risk aaa seems to be mostly about minimal risk and big names these days instead of innovative storytelling and controversial messages
IAmA,not_removed,first of all congratulations and good luck for the future i had to look up when i bought curious expedition was may wow love the game and while ive never managed to win its always been so much fun in an ideal world no time or monetary issues what would you have done differently with development of ce also as a sneaky extra question any plans for an expansion always thought the lack of arctic maps was a shame not to mention the amazing jules verne themed expeditions journey to the centre of the earth leagues under the sea and maybe even a space themed one ala around the moon
IAmA,not_removed,when i was recommending this game to someone as a century english explorer roguelike he asked me if there was racism to which i responded that that was basically the point you steal religious artifacts and doom the native population to be swallowed up by the void i normally prefer to play the good guy in games but theres something about being a total imperialist douchebag that amuses me was it intended that the player enjoy being a callous bastard in this game or was that just a natural consequence of the base setting second while i do enjoy the odd bit of mad cackling have you thought about making the consequences of your actions a bit more impactful as it stands i have yet to not take an action because it might negatively impact my standing its cheaper to get a nights rest with a native village after robbing one of their shrines than it is to rest at a mission and you have to do an awful lot to get them to attack you both from the perspective of meaningful gameplay choices and from wanting to play a good guy every now and then there should be more reasons to maintain a reasonable or even high standing with them
IAmA,not_removed,dont know if youre still answering or if someone has asked this but i both want to learn programming and art art i feel as though its primarily practice but how does one start pixel art now with programming i just dont know where to start and its overwhelming how much is on the subject what would you recommend to someone starting out
IAmA,not_removed,anyone can answer this what is the replay value from the screen shots it looks like its a randomly generated world but i keep hearing about expeditions does that mean after the one there isnt any replay value
IAmA,not_removed,how much pussy do you get for being a game developer
IAmA,not_removed,i was expecting a lot more from the game then we got and i regret buying it on early access do you feel like people who buy early access games should get more rewards for their money since theyre basically taking on the risk and role of investor but you guys get to reap the rewards if the game is popular where as an investor i just get a game for slightly less than i would pay later
IAmA,not_removed,in general i like the refund policy of steam allowing to refund crappy games i also like how gog galaxy allows to roll back patches that are problematic for your machine there are a lot of small policy and technical things that could be done but overall i think players have just to be more careful in the future of what to buy and make sure that they read the reviews and learn about the developer there is definitely a problem with too many unreliable developers pushing out crappy early access titles getting through steam greenlight is not a great indicator for quality unfortunately so some greater barrier of entry wouldnt be bad necessarily
IAmA,not_removed,a lot of early access games fall through or stop all together any way we can improve that in your minds let people refund early access games after anytime until they are out of early access this way people who play an early version of a game for more than two hours arent fucked out of their money when the updates stop rolling in or the direction of the game changes dramatically
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think there is the ultimate way of doing early access i guess well see more different approaches to this way of making a game on various platforms over the coming years for example i really like the refinery idea of itchio where you can sell a limited amount of keys for your game combined with the password protected forums you can have a much more intimate relationship with your players during the early phase this helps a lot in gathering feedback and making sure that you are able to have a healthy and working communication with people that are invested in your game from early on
IAmA,not_removed,when events happen we usually check for flags on the trek units for example if the unit is english its gender if its angry or human or animal sometimes we forget to set these flags and i once had this during a night my water buffalo sneaked away because it became paranoid and stole all my shovels it was hilarious and i really wondered what the buffalo was up to with all the shovels we mostly loved these kinds of bugs and in many cases we actually do not prevent them from happening its just part of making a procedural game you have to let it go in some areas and not restrict things too much otherwise you lose a lot of what makes them special in other instances we did fix bugs but they inspired us to recreate them as actual features thats for example how the idea of animals speaking when you are low on sanity got into the game
IAmA,not_removed,when we started to talk about making a game early on we knew we wanted to do a game about a topic that was uncommon in modern games we soon found that we were both very interested in historic expeditions especially all the cruel and sometimes hilarious ways they failed that was our starting point then there were the following things childhood memories of playing games like fate of atlantis civilization oregon trail burntime or seven cities of gold indiana jones the travels of alexander von humboldt stories of jules verne both books and the old cinemascope movies
IAmA,not_removed,initially our primary way was by using twitter on saturdays there is screenshotsaturday event which helped us a lot initially i would still recommend getting a twitter presence early on basically before youre even comfortable we also did an early dev log over on the tigsourcecom forums which was very useful for early feedback but from my own perception activity on the forum has slowed down quite a bit based on these two activities and our unusual concept we already got our first coverages eg in rock paper shotgun since most of our players are on steam now we also use our steam community hub a lot in general especially as a small indie its super important to be reachable and stay in close contact with your players
IAmA,not_removed,in terms of connections to other aaa devs id say this was completely irrelevant however it was an interesting thing for press people to write about also weve collected alot of experience in developing games while working in the aaa industry this helped as lot in not making certain mistakes we did other mistakes instead in my opinion there is a luck factor yes but you can work hard and make it more likely that you are lucky before i worked on the expedition i barely did pixelart i did some smaller things here and there because im a fan of the restrictions and aesthetics but i used to be an environment artist working with tools on highpoly stuff soi basically worked it out while we were doing the game no this would not have been possible firstly when you are employed at a games company usually your contract does not allow you to do commercial games in your free time also doing the expedition was a fulltime job pretty much all the time
IAmA,not_removed,depends on your level of experience if its just about learning how to make games i would suggest to start simple just clone an existing small game idea dont get wrapped up in endless discussions about the perfect engine just start with something eg unity or game maker it will take quite some time before you outgrow whatever engine you chose after having done your first couple of mini games i would start participating in game jams that will help you meet new people teach you lots of new skills and help you develop the skill of actually releasing things and once you want to do your first real game dont do one of those just like this other game but with a random thematical change these days its reaaaaally hard to stand out with your indie game so spend the appropriate amount of time really thinking about why your game would find an audience we like to develop our games by brainstorming the core fantasytheme first and then finding the appropriate game mechanics instead of the other way around
IAmA,not_removed,just adding a few things to what riad said already get in touch with your local community if you are all alone it can be really hard to make a game learn or judge your own work and if there is no community create one by doing a meetup having like minded people with similar problems around you is something absolutely invaluable dont just look at digital games when trying to find inspiration there are many things that will inspire and influence you so go play boardgames in a local place go to museums watch movies and read books one of my alltime favorite quote from tim schafer is to make interesting games you have to be an interesting person
IAmA,not_removed,theres a ton of stuff we learned during this project its actually hard to pick out two so here are two random things i learned its okay to question your own capabilities you just have to get used to the constant emotional roller coaster ride when youre independent even a person like notch probably still has bad days where he attributes all his success to sheer luck so dont be too harsh on yourself as long as youre doing your best and constantly pushing your comfort zone having freed ourselves from the shackles of aaa game development and working on my first game as game designer i tried to question literally every single game convention out there to the point where it was alienating some players i learned that there is a middle ground where you can be still innovative but dont need to reinvent every single wheel in your game
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for spending so much effort and time in making these videos it really means a lot to us to answer your question having videos of people playing our game is absolutely invaluable for various reasons you are basically providing us with perfectly documented playtests whenever a bug pops up in a video that we havet seen yet we can just copy the link to the exact moment of the video into our bug database which makes it much easier for us to figure out what is broken also when im bored i just take a notepad and watch some lets plays and take notes on small improvements or tuning changes usually i have a full page of tasks after not too long and can work them off immediatelly last but not least obviously having a lot of videos about our game really helps to spread the word and increase our customer base however this is mostly true for large channels the benefits of the smaller ones are mostly the testing pruposes i mentioned above initially it felt really weird to watch other people play our game it takes some time to be able to enjoy it because the initial tendency to cringe whenever something goes wrong with our gamesystems or when the rng behaves weird or when our tuning fails takes a lot of time to go away watching these videos and we try to watch as many as we can is one of the aspects that really helps us to feel in touch with the people that play our game when you are selling your game on the internet it can be hard to understand what a customer means its just so hard to relate and in all honesty im really having issues imagining these more then people that bought our game but being able to watch someone play which can be a very intimate experience really helps to stay grounded and remember why we are doing this if anything i always feel very thankful towards the people people like you with small channels for devoting so much of their time to play record and upload videos of our game
IAmA,not_removed,of the project were funded by medienboard berlinbrandenburg which is a local state grant agency for movies and interactive media there are biyearly submission periods where you can submit for a funding if youre in our region their terms are very generous as they dont ask for any company share or project influence and you will only have to pay back the money if you actually make money with your project as of early we were able to fully refund their € the other we paid from our personal savings as were only two persons and we worked for and years in aaa prior to doing this this was possible for us it was our dream to do a game completely independent and luckily we managed to actually do so
IAmA,not_removed,thats tough to answer because it is both less and more stressful than aaa let me try this its more stressful because yes if you fail with your game you have noone else to blame but you if things go stagnant or the game is not developing in the direction you imagined it to be youll blame yourself in general you should be a mentally stable person to try this kind of thing or team up with someone who can help you through the hard times because it can really really be an emotional roller coaster its less stressful because you can chose what to work on in your game there is no one that tells you what is important and which areas of your fantasy you should tackle first this makes it possible that you absolutely love your game no matter what which can be hard in the aaa environment where you usually are directed by people higher up in the hierarchy that think they know better what the game needs at a given time in addition being able to chose when to work how much on your game is really helpful typical working environments do not incorporate personal lifestyles or other things like flexible working times because you are taking turns with your partner to look after the kids or whatever being able to chose your working times for yourself is something we really appreciate this also allows us to get involved in all kinds of different things like participating in gamejams or organizing them travel to meet other developers or give talks or workshops being able to expand your personal horizon by doing things which are related to making games but not necessarily are only about making your game can be very uplifting and enjoyable which makes you a much more happy and stressfree person in general
IAmA,not_removed,that is an excellent question and something weve been wondering a lot about ourselves honestly with all this early access development model the number has lost a lot of its significance we found more success on early access than we originally anticipated so we just invested basically all our earnings into an extended early access phase basically one year longer than anticipated at this point we feel weve over delivered on the original goals we had of course there is always more that could be done and we still have plenty of ideas for further updates but we feel that at this point the game warrants its price even if we would not touch it further the milestone is basically to signal that
IAmA,not_removed,first and foremost we had the fantasy that guided our decision making the whole time expeditions into uncharted territories for fame and glory where youll eventually be eaten by a dinosaur if youre not riding it yourself whenever we had to make a gamedesign decision we could go back and check against the expedition fantasy does this feature serve it or not we made a ton of things that didnt end up in the game heck we had a full fledged triangulation system once and there is nothing left of it in the game we worked very much through iterations which helped us to create something in our opinions quite unique however this was not always easy as you get attached to ideas and after youve implemented them throwing away can become very emotional i think this is where our experience from aaa helped a lot just because you can implement something quickly and it looks good does not mean that it wont create a massive tail of necessities months later that make it really not worth having the feature in the game in the first place scoping is super important and super hard for gamedev beginners as well as for veterans one more thing are the restrictions be it from the pixelart or the setup we had from early on restrictions really helped us to stay on track and not go overboard with all the ideas we had for our game so a restrictive environment can be really really good
IAmA,not_removed,we did outsource two things music and sound as this is the only field we really have no confidence at all in making it ourselves and a very small amount of background images when looking for a musician we did make a big decision round based on various online applications but ended up working together with a local person who actually was in school with riad it was a good decision because not only he brought a strong auditive personality into the project but we could also communicate in person which really made a lot of things very easy if i had to decide between working with someone online or someone who i am able to meet up in person ill always chose the local but that may just be me
IAmA,not_removed,we knew from the beginning that we had to prove that were reliable developers early access has a bad stigma to some degree and for a good reason we just wanted to show that were two normal persons that are chasing their dream which is why we came up with the idea of making our update videos and showing ourselves in them regularly not trying to build up a facade of professionalism but instead show a glimpse at the persons behind the product is in my opinion a very healthy way to approach the whole early access thing and also helps small developers to set yourself apart from the big mainstream industry we have not yet received any curses from other developers but are more than willing to help them show the light of a wellbeing positive and honest approach to early access concerning your followup we want to be always be honest and humble about developing games thats why we are doing this our games are very personal and we put so much of ourselves into them so even if we fail to make a good game i hope well never fail these principles thats why i think well never have to stream our own suicides
IAmA,not_removed,risk is hard to assess in general there are no safe bets in indie games no genres that will absolutely work actually in my opinion the riskiest thing to do as a small indie developer is to take no risks at all being agile and brave is pretty much our biggest advantage as small indie compared to bigger publisher backed games for this game we pretty much went with our dream concept and hoped that we would find people that shared our taste we shared our concept already early and the twitter reaction gave us confidence to quit our jobs and to start a company
IAmA,not_removed,personally i havent played renowned explorers i know we were already over one year in production and publicly announced before we randomly ran into their game at gamescom we talked a bit and they are a nice bunch of people we didnt know about their game at that point but they recognized us immediately i dont know if and how much inspiration they took from us i think the market is big enough to handle two expedition games and i think our games are actually quite different even judging from the trailers alone
IAmA,not_removed,the biggest boost was releasing the game on steam to be honest also getting featured by steam in general press barely moves the needle in our experience rock paper shotgun is the exception big letsplayers have resulted in the big sales bumps too
IAmA,not_removed,hey thanks i loved my time at yager youre right that we cant say much about apart from the fact that we left yager about one year before the cancellation of having seen both sides i prefer indie development the explanation is quite easy working on a aaa product your inhouse team can easily grow beyond people lets say its people that leaves every person with of influence of the game ignoring the fact that there are leads and directors just the sheer amount of decisions that need to be made on a daily basis results in lots of areas of the game that you have no influence about i would rather have influence on a small game than influence on a huge game thats a bit over simplified of course but at the end of the day it comes down to that basically also smaller teams allow you to wear many different hats while bigger teams usually force you to specialize in something which is more boring in regards of day to day work for me i wouldnt rule out going back to aaa one day but im quite satisfied with my job at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,they are recorded with a canon camcorder legria or infrequently also with a canon dslr eos i think we use adobe premiere for editing on a basic windows machine
IAmA,not_removed,oh and not to forget we used a zoom to record our audio having a good audio quality really improves the quality of your videos so this is certainly a good position to drop some money and the zoom is really affordable as well
IAmA,not_removed,we worked for years in the same team at aaa developer yager that was a very good check to see how well we could work together so we already had an idea what we were getting ourselves into before starting the company
IAmA,not_removed,im happy for whoever has success i wish the game wouldnt have been so overhyped though i hope it doesnt leave a lasting bad impression about procedural generation in the future as were still very excited about the potential of procedural content
IAmA,not_removed,httpcuriouscasecom
IAmA,not_removed,there was already another question about funding so make sure to check that one out too an additional point though we worked lots of evenings and weekends on our project while still being employed in the aaa industry basically we made sure that we were confident enough that we would be able to produce something sellable in the available time frame before leaving our job it was pretty hard at times to be honest not saying that its easy
IAmA,not_removed,most of the custom explorers are modelled after players so we just asked them what kind of archetype they would like to be represented as pirate astrologist scientist etc and then chose the perks based on that
IAmA,not_removed,its mostly a case by case decision we have this webform that we send people that have purchased the explorer edition there they can enter all kinds of information about their desired explorer from name to profession gender and other things we have dropdown options for most things but its also possible to propose special wishes so far we have been able to fullfill almost all of these special things almost im looking at you wolfman honestly ive hardly ever had a better time making games than with this aspect of the expedition reading the wishes of the people the desired names professions and basically identity they want for their custom explorer along with the provided photgraph of themselves creates a very intimate releationship that ive never before experienced when working on a game
IAmA,not_removed,were also distributing over gog and the humblestore and were selling the soundtrack over itchio there are some strict tax laws in europe for selling digital content basically you have to pay the vat not depending on your own country but depending on where the player is located not all stores expose this information or handle it automatically so at some point it becomes a matter of if the additional complexity of sales is actually worth it
IAmA,not_removed,sometimes we get approached by people that want to buy large bulks of keys so they can resell them at their own platforms for a good price so far we have never agreed on something like this because the whole keyreselling market right now is very hard to oversee and honestly seems a bit fishy
IAmA,not_removed,as regular aaa game devs we were not responsible at all for marketing so its hard to compare the two as we didnt think about how to get exposure for the game that was the job of a whole marketing department now we have to do our marketing ourselves and have to apply a completely different mindset to the whole development process personally i find this process much more enjoyable compared to being completely secluded from that aspect it makes you feel less like a cog in the machine and more like a game maker that is allowed to have opinions on things we feel like we owe a lot of our early visibility to being active on twitter i would definitely recommend establishing an early twitter presence and sharing media about your game most importantly is having a strong game concept though having a concept that is easy to communicate will go a long way in helping with marketing
IAmA,not_removed,also being honest and blunt in our communication seemed to help a lot not only it is fun to just be able to speak your mind and not have to think trough every single comment or statement you are doing it also shows that we are really just two persons that are not so different from the people that buy our game
IAmA,not_removed,personally i studied computer science at university thats a useful education but back then there was no clear career path and indie development did not exist these days i would consider going to a dedicated game school maybe either way realize that most of what will define your success as game developer cant be simply taught at any of those places its the knowledge that you only gain by actually working on real games working on your craft endlessly pushing your comfort zone learning to network and so on these days there are so many free engines available if you want to get into game development download the unity engine or game maker and do a tutorial you can be a game developer literally in one hour from now you just have to start somewhere
IAmA,not_removed,i got into games while i was working at a company that did websites i used to be the back then macromedia flash developer doing weird animated interfaces eventually the company did some smaller flash games and i found that i not only enjoy playing but also making games my main advise is that you should participate in as many gamejams as you can gamejams are a great way to learn how to make games experiment in which area of development you feel most comfortable and get to know likeminded people in my opinion you have the biggest learnings early on in a game so making a lot of small very focused games is a perfect starting point dont get hung up too much on your huge idea for a game but save that for later and do quick and dirty experimental games from there you can grow and make slightl larger ones and who knows maybe youll find yourself working on a jam game that sparks enough interest from press and players that youll be able to develop it further and make money off it
IAmA,not_removed,the most difficult thing is not getting a guaranteed monthly paycheck and wondering what you will live off in two months working in aaa felt more secure a lot of that is psychological though as your project can get randomly cancelled in aaa and you might be without a job from one day to the next when youre indie you at least know how much time you have before you have to worry on of the biggest perks is doing things like this literally this reddit ama in aaa you would have to go through a long media briefing teaching you exactly what youre allowed to say and what not at the current stage if you are allowed to talk at all to the public that is
IAmA,not_removed,ive interviewed quite a few job applicants at my former job and i feel like there are basically two types of applicants for entry positions those that say they love games and would be super passionate about games but have nothing to show those that say the love games and have worked on a kickass mod or have programmed some impressive demos basically dont just talk the talk but walk the walk make sure that you already have something to show when you exit your school these days engines are basically available for free there are plenty of free tutorials wikis programming books out there literally the only person stopping you from becoming a game developer right now is yourself its not important what you do exactly just do something and get moving dont spend forever pondering what perfect programming language to use or researching for months what the perfect engine is just pick a small game design idea or clone one and then implement it and after that do another one and then another one and then participate in game jams and do more games and do mods and more games and eventually you will have gotten really good at it dont expect to just do your game school or university and thats it make sure to use the time to network and build up an impressive portfolio that will be more important than your actual credentials in the end good luck
IAmA,not_removed,edit because i misread the question the game is done in our own engine the engine is based on an canvas backend the programming language is coffeescript which is similar to javascript we use the sublimetext editor for editing the code and script for art johannes used photoshop
IAmA,not_removed,ok ill let riad give you the details on the coding side but artwise we used photoshop for all static imagery pixelart graphics gale for frame animations texture packer to create atlas files for all images created with photoshop licecap and gifcam for creating animated gifs mostly for marketing stuff trello for project management google docs for tables documentation and planning premiere and after effects for all our update videos audacity for sounds and to improve our audio recordings for the update videos chronolapse for all the timelapse videos
IAmA,not_removed,i was just a programmer back then so i had limited insight but when i started at the company the game was still a military scifi game with cloaking devices and super weapons i think it was a very collaborative effort morphing it into the antiwar game we know now
IAmA,not_removed,we cant really answer this question as we were not responsible for any contractual or business related work at yager we were just employees there however what i can say is that was more than willing to create a very special game together with yager and that they had as many crazy the positive crazy people influencing the design decisions that made the game unique as we had on our side
IAmA,not_removed,wow you are a true early supporter thank you so much for that phew its really hard to imagine this ideal world first off i really think that more money and time does not always have a positive influence on the game im a big fan of restrictions were really happy with how everything turned out but there is one thing i can certainly say that i would have liked the possibility to do more animations we did some early tests with idle animations on our characters attack animations during combat and little walking animations when the characters appeared in a scene however we ultimately had to decide against it because it would have been too much workload for our tiny team yes we certainly have plans for expanding on the game we want to keep adding more things like explorers units to recruit events and locations as free updates in the coming months also one of our biggest goals is to have modding support which is something we are really keen on supplying our fanbase with our game just lends so much to modding and we cant wait to see what the fans of the game will come up with and hopefully maybe even create better things than we did for the intial version were also considering larger themed updates to the game in form of dlcs while we are still only in the it would be cool to do this and that phase some ideas include the obvious arctic expeditions more game modes subterranean expeditions and many other things but even if we never get to do these well certainly will do the modding support so our community can create whatever they can think of the scripting language wehave developed during the production of the expedition is very advanced while simple enough for me to work with it and allows many ways to manipulate and create basially every aspect of the game even full conversion would be possible yes space theme
IAmA,not_removed,if you want to keep in the imperialism you could make religious conversion a thing missionaries already exist in the game but what if high standing made the natives more perceptive to listening to your missionaries and when you got back to london youd be rewarded by the church for your duties to god fame for spreading christianity and church funding for your expedition because they want you to keep this behavior up requires high standing and living natives no tossing them into the void and while id say its morally neutral convincing people to adopt your beliefs without violence it does carry that somewhat uncomfortable colonialist imperialist vibe
IAmA,not_removed,if you play certain death difficulty i assure you that youre going to find the standing very important yet very hard to juggle you can easily get off your ship and go to the first village and thats youre entire sanity bar you rest there but only get sanity back obviously you would want to rest one or two more times now youre in or standing and the native dont want you to sleep there anymore without trading you go and steal from a shrine and now the natives are doing everything they can to wall you off walking back to your ship after the pyramid only on certain death i usually just toss a dynamite at the village after i am sure i dont have to go back or the standing is beyond repairing
IAmA,not_removed,yes it is randomly generated worlds characters and story lines its a bit similar to other roguelites like ftl and binding of isaac where the game is designed around replayability reaching the game end does not mean that you have won the game as that also depends on your ranking amongst your rivals also there different explorers to choose form different play styles different difficulty settings etc we have a lot of players that have played over hours of the game so i think replay value is not bad
IAmA,not_removed,hey sorry to hear that you regret your purchase first i think you are not taking the role of an investor as there is no risk involved other than spending in our case also in the very beginning we sold our game for less than the current price to reward our early supporters compared to an investor you immediately get a game whereas an investor has to usually wait a long period of time to see whether or not the gamble worked out i dont know what other reward there should be than a game anything else i can come up with would be artificial fluff like experience points badges or whatever which would in my opinion only worsen the situation obviously we cant create a game that will satisfy every player out there but in our case we can say that we never promised something that we didnt deliver or that we intentionally made misleading statements about what our game would ultimately become just out of curiosity what did you expect from our game features graphics gamemodes
IAmA,not_removed,one problem with a higher barrier to entry is where the line is drawn as it stands the high expectations and entry barriers of the aaa industry are the reason we have indie games some of which like undertale blow up to a far greater popularity than their indev content would suggest
IAmA,not_removed,let people refund early access games after anytime until they are out of early access that is not really practical because steam has to send the money to the developers bank account after a certain time
IAmA,not_removed,thats a horrible idea people would play stuff for hours and then refund it simply because they can and because of this developers would avoid going early access like the plague basically this idea would mean the end for early access
IAmA,not_removed,another thing is what type of game were talking about i think some games lend themselves better to an early access model than others roguelikes are a great fit for example since they are focused around replaying the game but if your game has linear progression then theyll miss content that has changed in parts of the game that theyve already beaten or miss parts of the story that werent fleshed out yet when they first played the game
IAmA,not_removed,ive already started establishing twitter and instagram presence my initial results show that its quite easy to get noticed by other developers but reaching gamers is whole another story do you have any tips on reaching them
IAmA,not_removed,awesome thank you for the answers
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for your response you are very welcome i never thought of it like that your answer puts a bit of a new perceptive on lets plays for me i never really looked at it as a playtest i also never really thought that devs would look at the videos and take notes on what to improve that too is new to me thank you again for your response and i look forward to recording when it comes out congratulations once again and i look forward to seeing what else is in store for you guys
IAmA,not_removed,great response ive just become aware of your game a few days ago and havent pulled the trigger on purchasing just yet ive been burned and burned and burned on early access titles the only exception for me has been the forest how do you stand on sequels are you of a mind to reiterate the same concept regardless of new content and mechanics or are you and your codeveloper aiming to create something unique each and every time i only ask this because it seems like the major studios are stuck in a rut of releasing the same game every years looking at you ea ubi activision edit i also realize the dlc revenue stream is a great temptation for a developer i sincerely hope that if you ever go the dlc route that you will offer a ton of content for a modest price
IAmA,not_removed,also weve joked about doing an expedition games bundle at some point so lets see
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for the answer i totally understand your preference for indie development i do look forward to your forward to seeing what you do next have a great day
IAmA,not_removed,this may be necroposting but curious expedition revived my faith in procedural generation after nms torched it
IAmA,not_removed,curious expedition is a wonderful game i like nearly everything about it and played for like or so i would like to know if you can tell us any details about your next project cc
IAmA,not_removed,fair point from most of your comments it seems that the aaa in your case had you pretty disconnected from everything outside of a singular role i turned down a community management job for a aaa for this reason as well but thought it might have only been them personally that faced this issue kinda sad to see this is more common then i thought
IAmA,not_removed,i agree that personality is core to communication with users as it makes them want to engage you and feel that your more approachable from what riadd said twitter had been a big help to you both in having that outlit to be personal how large of a following did you all build up before pulling the trigger on putting it on steam was there a set number of followers you were aiming for or an engagement rate that you used for judging when you were ready
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt know the game did start out so far from what it ended up being thats interesting
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the answer
IAmA,not_removed,i would be totally willing to buy makeover dlc that basically reskins the game as something else science fiction stuff id love to explore the canals on mars and talk with the few surviving tribes of martians and then accidentally set off the doomsday device inside the remains of some martian laboratory dooming all the locals but still getting back to earth alive and with our spoils intact so you know net win things like the shrines could easily be remade to have powerful martian tech instead of gold icons and be protected by ancient hightech security measures instead of ancient curses
IAmA,not_removed,first i think you are not taking the role of an investor as there is no risk involved other than spending in our case i dont think you understand what an investor is you guys are asking for money for an unfinished project youre asking for investors the early access system might have creators all fucked in the head thinking theyre selling a real product during the early access run but really youre just asking for money man i get something out of it but i am investing in the hopes ill get a full completed game not what i am buying at the time its a risk not a huge one but the size of a risk doesnt dictate weather its an investment or not if it wasnt for early access where would you be getting your funding from the money tree dont be thick you lose that when you go indie other games offer rewards for people that arent superficial maybe the problem with the game is you guys just arent a very creative bunch let people design stuff for the game let people create events for the game characters tribes people love seeing things they make put into stuff that would have been an awesome reward you could have given me an extra copy of the game to give to a friend that would be a nice plus and someone else would get to play your game you could have sent out physical rewards printing off and sending out cool old fake maps from the game or something along that line would have been a great reward to the players i know you cant make a game that satisfies everyone i didnt lay into the game that much for that reason i just found it kind of empty for a game of its type i also found it far to luck based and not skilled based some people like that in a game but i am not one of those people its fine though i just wanted more of what you have i feel like we go a game that needs to be many times bigger than what we got for it to be worth it
IAmA,not_removed,you mean people would have to finish something to get paid but its
IAmA,not_removed,thats a horrible idea people would play stuff for hours and then refund it simply because they can if they put hours in the chances of them refunding are pretty low i would say
IAmA,not_removed,yes absolutely agree early access does not work for all kinds of games something like the witness wouldnt make a lot of sense
IAmA,not_removed,there is no shortcut that im aware off it helps making a game that has a strong themeidea that can be communicated effectively if you dont have that consider keeping looking for it until you find it experiment with different formatstopics your audience will let you know when youre onto something
IAmA,not_removed,we have so many more ideas in us that we cant wait to work on something new and original again life is too short for redoing the game over and over again we already have something httpcuriouscasecom we learned a ton of things about procedural generation we would like to take some of these learnings into our next game instead of starting from scratch eg by doing a racing game also we think weve build an audience that is into this kind of games so our next game will be completely new and original but hopefully youll still be able to tell that it has the same developers behind it as the curious expedition we have plans for more content for tce but we dont know yet in which form well exactly deliver it also there will be hopefully a big modding community once we release our modding tools so there should be plenty of content for the next years to come hopefully i cant wait to play the mods myself
IAmA,not_removed,its still a bit early for that we havent developed it far enough to exactly know what it is yet but i think i can already say that we really want to push the boundaries of what is possible with procedural content and that we wouldnt be able to make the new game without all of the experience we gained on tce it is very ambitious
IAmA,not_removed,another thing we can probably say is that we want to experiment in different areas of procedural generation most procedural games and the curious expedition is no exception tend to generate landscapes worlds and level geometry but this is only a very small field and there are many more aspects of a game that can be generated and trying to apply procedural generation to one of these untapped fields is what excites us the most about our next game the curious case
IAmA,not_removed,im sorry to jump in here but what you are saying is simply not true the things you are describing fit very well for a crowdfunded game that is true however an early access title is much different you already pretty much know that there is a game and can read reviews about it and see how other people expirienced it there is already a lot of work in the game yes there is still a risk though it is very small you get to actively participate in the development of the game which is super awesome for the developer and yourself if you are into it if you are not then you should not engage in ea in short if you have problems with the size of an ea game dont buy it in ea
IAmA,not_removed,games are never finished they are merely abandoned by their creators totally stole this from someone way more clever than i am but forgot who it was
IAmA,not_removed,have you even met people
IAmA,not_removed,this just seems like semantics to me its basically all the same thing you can look into something before you invest in it too usually youre not investing in an idea youre often invested in an small business a product already along the way in development if you are a major investor in something you fucking bet you get to help guide the direction of it fact many investors insist on this i think a lot of people in the gaming community just dont understand what investing really is i am allowed to have an opinion on the value of something if you dont like x dont x never adds anything to a conversation
IAmA,not_removed,games can be eternally expanded upon but they can also be finished
IAmA,not_removed,yes apparently better ones than you hang out with
IAmA,not_removed,you still havent really answered the question of what you were expecting from the game that wasnt delivered on or do you just wish that you could have had more influence on the game and in that case what led you to believe that you would have that kind of influence if you buy the game in early access if you are a major investor in something you fucking bet you get to help guide the direction of it fact many investors insist on this judging from the answers in the ama the budget for this was around money from early access how much guidance do you think you should get for buying the product for bucks you are getting a game even if unfinished in return immediately so maybe considering all of those bucks an investment might be a far call as well and lets say you could influence development and make a quest or whatever for the game that will require the developers to put work into your idea to implement it and make it work and make sure it fits into the game do you think anyone could realistically do that for everyone that buys an early access game how much work time do you think bucks is worth for people highly qualified to make games i think a lot of people in the gaming community just dont understand what investing really is what makes you so certain that you do
IAmA,not_removed,i am not devoiding you of your opinion dont worry i just think that there is a big difference between to stay within your semantics investing into a crowdfunding traditionally only in an idea or prototyping phase and investing into an early access game traditinionally in a much later phase of development alpha or beta sure in both you get to shape the direction of the product but in the later you are in far less risk of not recieving anything so while technically we could talk of an investment in all of the cases i think its a far too broad term to describe them but i do agree that these things have become quite muddy with the market being flooded with lower than par products imho curious expedition is not one of them i think they did an excellent job with developing the game hand in hand with the community while still progressing it forward to the product they envisioned now i am curious though what do you consider a good early access game
IAmA,not_removed,something something your mom i guess
IAmA,not_removed,just for the record if you check our steam forums youll see that we reply to over of all threads we reply to of all emails that we get weve done over feature updates and a dev video for each of them explaining what we changed and why weve added dozens of features and events based solely on player feedback
IAmA,not_removed,its clear youre missing the point here i said there should be some rewards for buying in early beyond just getting a half finished version of the game i dont expect full creative control i said some influence would have been a great reward i also gave some other suggestions that they could have used as rewards but the fact that you can only seem to focus on one is strange and makes me think you just wanna argue instead of talk i think a lot of people in the gaming community just dont understand what investing really is what makes you so certain that you do the meaning of the word to put money to use by purchase or expenditure in something offering potential profitable returns as interest income or appreciation in value
IAmA,not_removed,now i am curious though what do you consider a good early access game lisa the painful had a great campaign the game had a lot of backer influence in it many of the characters were deigned by backers with the games designer
IAmA,not_removed,what i want to know is how you imagine that some influence to work the reward for buying in early at least from my perspective is that you get it cheaper and you have some limited influence by giving feedback a single users feedback wont move anything but if you post about it and other people follow up and agree with you any sensible developer will at least consider it the other question that you have still left unanswered is what you were expecting from the game that wasnt delivered on your complaints seem to mostly be focused on things surrounding the development of the game and not the game itself you mentioned that you thought the game lacks in content and is too random for your taste as you also said the second point certainly comes down to preference whereas the first point is a little ironic do you think there would have been more content if people would have had more influence communication costs time so the more influence the community would have had on the game the less content there would have been its clear youre missing the point here i said there should be some rewards for buying in early beyond just getting a half finished version of the game i dont expect full creative control i said some influence would have been a great reward i assume you are referring to this other games offer rewards for people that arent superficial maybe the problem with the game is you guys just arent a very creative bunch calling the developers not creative enough if probably a great way to talk instead of argue but aside from that lets look at the other suggestions let people design stuff for the game let people create events for the game characters tribes people love seeing things they make put into stuff that would have been an awesome reward thats the first suggestion which i already discussed before and the point still stands if you dont want full creative control both other points are burning money or burning time and money you could have given me an extra copy of the game to give to a friend that would be a nice plus and someone else would get to play your game whats the point of giving you a free copy to give to a friend in a nonmultiplayer game and how is that any different from halving the price of the game you could have sent out physical rewards printing off and sending out cool old fake maps from the game or something along that line would have been a great reward to the players sending out physical rewards is an absolute nightmare you have to collect everyones addresses you have to handle international shipping and figure out what you can send where and how much tax might be on sending it there and what not you have to find a company that can potentially mass produce these rewards you have to design them and go back and forth with the production facility if there are any issues at all how much time and money do you think that costs all of those ressources would go into physical rewards and not the game we are talking about a really small indie studio here everyone there is working on the game but they would have to deal with all of these logistics which isnt their area of expertise which would make them waste a lot more time on it than necessary and result in less content in the actual game i also gave some other suggestions that they could have used as rewards but the fact that you can only seem to focus on one is strange and makes me think you just wanna argue instead of talk i focused on one because the point i was making there transfers to your other two suggestions as well all of that would take ressources away from making the actual game that you invested in yes i do want to argue because thats what you do when you have differing opinions to put money to use by purchase or expenditure in something offering potential profitable returns as interest income or appreciation in value if thats your definition of investing then buying a nice bottle of wine makes you an investor as well or buying a car that might be considered an oldie years down the line sure you can call it that but it wont have the same connotation that you probably want it to have you know i can quote definitions too httpwwwinvestopediacomtermsiinvestorasp
IAmA,not_removed,eh design by committee is usually horrible id much rather leave it up to the designers to create their vision they may not always hit it out of the park but at least they are creating what they intended
IAmA,not_removed,im a little sensitive to infrared light i can see the led on the end of a remote control blink and see the light cast out if i hold my hand in front of it most security cameras with infrared illumination i can see a dull red glow on the ground in front its not super obvious but i notice it when i look for it im also really sensitive to light and often have to wear sunglasses even on cloudy days sleeping is a nightmare for me i have to put black electric tape over leds which are on like everything these days they seem to just burn right through my eyelids even with all that if my wife gets a message on her phone and the led on the front starts blinking its like a neon sign to me and wakes me instantly i know its not what you are looking for but its something
IAmA,not_removed,ive had one lens removed i saw that comment in the til post about black lights looking like normal lights thats not really true in my case but there is a noticeable difference depending on which eye i look out of from my lensless eye it looks more normal but it is still purple the difference induces double vision i do sometimes perceive colors differently depending on what eye im using usually its blue vs green
IAmA,not_removed,i read that some people with cataracts can see uv light
IAmA,not_removed,have them removed i should say
IAmA,not_removed,okay so ill go with that thanks for educating me

IAmA,not_removed,have you ever had to get aggressive a wild visitor if so what was the weirdest if those incidents this thread is totally underrated btw
IAmA,not_removed,how often do you have to confiscate drugs
IAmA,not_removed,are brazilian groups really the worst
IAmA,not_removed,a few years ago at disneyland one of our friends decided to keep her feet up in the matterhorn and apparently wasnt paying attention when she was told multiple times on the intercom to put her feet down we didnt even know she was doing it the ride stopped and they escorted all of us out of the park is it normal to kick out the whole group if only one person has done something wrong even if the rest of the group didnt even know they were doing it
IAmA,not_removed,i did my first college program at pecos bill in magic kingdom and we had a guy come in who seemed so drunk i was amazed he was able to stand up how often do you get heavily intoxicated people in the parks
IAmA,not_removed,favourite guy inside a disney costume not asking about the costume but the person inside it

IAmA,not_removed,is it true that if the queue timer for the haunted house reads mins there is in fact no queue and the wait time is mins also is there a driver for the big river paddle boat or it is on a track under the water cheers
IAmA,not_removed,how do you deal with drones
IAmA,not_removed,what is your opinion on the discrepancies between how full time cast part time cast and college interns are treated by management from personal experience my fellow custodial intern cast members and i were treated very poorly by our management despite doing more for the park we worked in than a lot of cast that got paid better and treated better than we did because disney is a company that has a squeaky clean image the way they treat their employees often flies under the radar id just really like to hear your thoughts on disney management as a whole if youre at liberty to discuss that
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt have a disney day mean fu
IAmA,not_removed,do you think wdw will ever get anything marvel related like a ride or merchandise i dont live in florida and have never been to wdw but i hear that since universal owns marvels theme park rights disney cant do it even though they bought marvel in also have you been to disneyland ive been there a million times but like i said ive never been to wdw which one do you think is better i wanna go to wdw one day but i hear that the magic kingdom isnt as great as disneyland
IAmA,not_removed,do you personally have a process for selecting people for the metal detector screenings or is it random and is there a way a guest can brighten a security officers day beyond a greetinghow are you kinda thing i realize ultimately you need to move people through as quick as possible
IAmA,not_removed,heading there just before christmas see you soon do you have any secret tips for a family that might not be easily found via a quick google search for disney tips and tricks i feel like were pretty dialed in but would love some inside info if you have any helpful secrets
IAmA,not_removed,what is disney hiding
IAmA,not_removed,what is your typical day to day like
IAmA,not_removed,what is the guy who plays gaston in real life that guy is hillarious
IAmA,not_removed,what do you know about discovery island and river country are there still security officers there to keep people from breaking into those abandoned parks

IAmA,not_removed,what do you guysthe actors do behind the stage do you interact with them or do you just keep them out of trouble
IAmA,not_removed,i just got accepted for the college program at disney im excited how does it feel to work there
IAmA,not_removed,when i went to disneyland my dad hade a roll of electrical tape with him and tur security at entry took it why
IAmA,not_removed,do people have sex at the park
IAmA,not_removed,any advice for someone who is looking to go to disney world for the first time
IAmA,not_removed,what is the worst thing youve experienced im not asking you to rat out anyone or even secretly complain about your job has someone suffered an injury that you were witness to has someone lost an adult and were panicking no lost children i remember that some other patron treating someone like crap things like that what was the worst for you
IAmA,not_removed,are you at all concerned your proof exposes who you are your cad is on your security id
IAmA,not_removed,its been said that the happiest place on earth is also a haven for child molesters because the real police are not called in and the victims paid off how much validity is there to this claim
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about being called a shill for a company founded by a man whom hitler expressed personal admiration for
IAmA,not_removed,i was handed a trespassing warning during the two weeks of my cp role custodial do to unforseen circumstances i was terminated and told not to step foot on disney property or face arrestcrazy part while at the costume area i contacted security and told them shortly id enjoy working security more was assigned locker number got my costume later went around to try and find my locker one thing led to another i was spoken to at the locker in short i want to speak to a rep anyhow must be awesome to work there how long are you planning to stay
IAmA,not_removed,it most definitely is on my first day i actually selected one of em to go through the metal detector because i didnt know she was undercovershe refuses to let me live it down
IAmA,not_removed,celebs that visit like adam sandler neil patrick harris johnny depp or other vip guests that arrive during special events actually keep to themselves and have private sections for their party specifically at the resort theyre staying at usually theyre escorted backstage to avoid people gawking when in the parks and such however ive heard stories about snooki and her family when they stay at the boardwalk they tend to be pretty entitled and arent too considerate of any other guests
IAmA,not_removed,yes actuallypeople actually try to jump fences and get in after parks close weve gotten pretty good at clearing a park at close and if youre trying to hide i guarantee the cameras will catch you and theyll call it in
IAmA,not_removed,i havent actually ill have to check it out
IAmA,not_removed,nope the croud control cast members usually keep guests at a distance from the characters unless theyre at a meet and greet to my knowledge i dont think anyones started anything with a character though
IAmA,not_removed,😂 oh man i havent caught anybody and i havent heard of anyone being caught recently i know that its happened before though oh manway to bring back some memories 🙄
IAmA,not_removed,nothing too freaky actuallyevery now and then people will try to sneak in guns or somethingapparently the guy behind the pulse shooting was scoping out disney springs before he settled on the night club
IAmA,not_removed,mouse traps and poison apples mostly also just any kind of weapon gunsgun parts knives pepper spray drugs honestly just anything you probably shouldnt bring into a family oriented establishment people ask us that question on a daily basis and were actually not allowed to say exactly what it is were looking for
IAmA,not_removed,i was afraid one of you would see thisbut nooooope im not devon
IAmA,not_removed,honestly disney is trying to up security to be metal detection and bag checks asap possibly by the end of the year in the past months disney has actually doubled the number of security officers and that number is still climbing as well as there are undercover officers in the park and always at least one police dog in front of the park on duty i assure you that its quite safe to come here the guy that did the pulse shooting was apparently scoping out disney springs before deciding the security was too tight and settled on the club i hope this answers your question and settles your nerves a bit feel free to pm me if youre still curious about anything else
IAmA,not_removed,were actually not allowed to touch guests even if they physically hurt us in any way likeif a guest were to start attacking me and throw me on the ground id literally have to either take it or try to get away and call for help however if it gets to that point once a second security officer gets on location were allowed to grab the guest by the arms and legs and carry em out haha
IAmA,not_removed,actually just the other day a guest tried to bring a pipe into the park that gentleman was escorted off property by local pdbut id say it happens at least once or twice a week
IAmA,not_removed,theyre not the worst but theyre extremely eccentric and come in large numbers theres definitely worse guests out there but where theres a whole bunch of brazillians it gets out of hand sometimes this year wasnt bad though a lot of the brazillians went to the olympics instead of coming here
IAmA,not_removed,that seems super extreme to be honest but its also disney land they kinda operate on different rules than we do here at disney world disney being a very family oriented its unheard of for them to kick people out for something as trivial as that if it were me id probably just talk to you guys and make sure you understood the rules but again its disney land so im not sure how they differ
IAmA,not_removed,depends on the time of year and park im surprised a guy was drunk at mk epcot literally has people passed out in bushes especially during food wine and flower garden festival hs and ak dont have nearly as many but it still happens
IAmA,not_removed,theres actually a ton of people that come in from make a wish foundation which i love seeing to me just seeing these kids have their dream come true and me being a part of that really makes my day i really enjoy talking to the kids and seeing how full of life and excited they are ill always make sure to try and brighten their day in a significant way i dont see many proposals where i mainly work obviously i dont work at mk but i do see a ridiculous amount of newly engaged and newly weds though
IAmA,not_removed,person in the costume i dont know what youre talking about but mickeys my homie
IAmA,not_removed,welltheres this lady thats epileptic im not sure if shes homeless or what but she literally comes on property once or twice a month just to have seizures around the boardwalk because reedy creek disney emtparamedics will transport her to the hospital free of charge
IAmA,not_removed,great question naturally there are rumors about hauntings at the haunted mansion but some of them are actually legit spooky stuff happening in there after close and before opening ive heard the attraction operators say that if they dont say good morning to a certain ghost i forget the name before park open the ride tends to have a ton of issues throughout the day for unexplained reasonsstuff like that i dont know if guests can do it but cast members can have backstage tours of specific attractions from time to time and you learn a lot of the history fun facts and quirks that most dont know fun fact there is a part in the ride that has a long hall with doors on either side and years ago people would say they kept seeing a shadowy figure walk across the hallway turns out one of the ride ops would do it and they ended up boarding up the doors so that no one can do that sort of thing anymore but it scared the hell out of some guests the hiring process is basically the same as any other job just apply and theyll call for an interview as long as you meet the qualifications
IAmA,not_removed,we get some pretty decent discounts usually but it depends on the time of yearim going with an on that one sirmaam
IAmA,not_removed,the american northern burley heuffard
IAmA,not_removed,so i actually moved here from seattle so the scenery is much more aesthetically pleasing in florida that being saidyou see a lot but no feels unfortunately 😭
IAmA,not_removed,ive never caught anyone but it happens when people try to sneak in backstage or hop fences it doesnt work though at all the managers have the ability to replace an item if they see fit and want to make little magic for our guests but it doesnt happen as often as it shoulddisney is pretty strict with stuff like that
IAmA,not_removed,there is definitely a queue for the haunted manion and the correct wait time is displayed for the attraction there are multiple clocks throughout and references to as far as the jungle cruise goes im actualy not sure about that one i know ive wondered that as well but i havent really asked about it
IAmA,not_removed,from the parking lot
IAmA,not_removed,theres not really a huge issue with people using drones to see backstage and stuff but in the few instances that it has happened we just report it to ocpd and they come out and handle it in their own way
IAmA,not_removed,talk about loaded questions so first offthis isnt my first role i was in the college program before doing an internal transfer to security the management for my previous role and security werent bad at all however in my previous role i was statused at specific resort but i also went to multiple other resortsthe management was hit or miss and depending on the resort the management either treated you like crap or they were super cool as far as part timefull timecp stuff goespart times get the shortest end of the stick the full timers and cps are guaranteed hours a week and the part timers basically get whats leftso you could imagine the great hours they must get personally working for disney is a job i dont look at it as glamorous or really expect it to be any better than any other jobbecause its a job that being said its a good job the people you work with are really great most of the time and there are so many different cultures coming together here you and your friends may have had a bad experience with management and that doesnt surprise mesome managers just dont care or think theyre hot shit and get a bit power tripped but a lot of the people that have had issues with management are kids that expected working for disney to be all fun and glamour and excitementi assure you its nothing like that disney is a business and young adults tend to forget that when they come to work here disney is able to treat their cast members the way they do only because the sad reality is that every cast member can be replaced there are thousands of people itching to get the job you have so at the end of the day you gotta play the game i hope this answered your questions if you want me to ellaborate at all just ask
IAmA,not_removed,all depends on how your demeanor is towards us ya know
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know about any rides or anything but disney has a bunch of marvel merchandise personally im a huge marvel fan and i really hope that we see something new to disney parks marvel related i went to disneyland once when i was really young so i dont remember it at all but from what i hear disney world is better size wise and such but disney land has a better tower of terror splash mountain and a few others
IAmA,not_removed,theres no process at allpeople constantly get super annoyed about being selected and adamantly declare that its obviously not a random selectioni promise its absolutely random there is literally zero reason for picking the people we pick if you want to make our day just dont give us any guff about random selections and bag checks we get itits frustrating you want to get in the park and you want to have fun but we have a job to do here and make sure its safe just smile be friendly and cooperative with us and itll be a quick and easy process
IAmA,not_removed,yes actually but only in magic kingdom its more of a holding place more than prison persay its just a place to hold guests that are incoherent until they are escorted away from property
IAmA,not_removed,fantastic keep in mind that the christmas holidays are going to be super busy second busiest time of the year first offunderstand that your family is going to be selected for metal detector screenings as well as bag checks please dont get pissed about it and just go ahead and do it really quick to make the process easier it makes us quite frustrated if guests give us a hard time and get pissy about the process secondly make fast passes for the rides that you absolutely must go on as soon as they become avaliable for you and just acvept that there will be long lines for a lot of the attractions this will be essential for you to get the most out of your time in the parks coordinate these times with meal reservations as well hint if you want free nachos bring some tortilla chips and paper plates with you to mk at the pecos bill restaurant there is self serve cheese guac sour cream and other stuff for a free quick snack 😉 if i were you id do all the big rides early or late in the day and throughout the mid day go to shows or just take a stroll around the parks should make the trip a bit more bearable if you have any specific questions feel free to pm me
IAmA,not_removed,walt disney is actually cryogenically frozen under pirates of the caribbean
IAmA,not_removed,get up go to work and the managers tellnus whats up go check a bunch if bags and that whole thing go on break a few times go homeits really nothing super intricate
IAmA,not_removed,guy who plays gaston im confused gaston is pretty hilarious he doesnt cause too much of a commotion anymore ever since we gave in and built his tavern though
IAmA,not_removed,both river country and discovery island arent really patrolled nor do they have heavy security at all its fairly easy to get back into these areas and explore around but absolutely not worth it youre likely to get caught and will literally be banned from all disney parks and locations indefinitelyif you were a cast member and you went exploring the the same would happen but youd be fired as well haha
IAmA,not_removed,minute breaks every hour are pretty nicebut its actually super satisfying for me when i randomly select guests for the metal detector and they throw a fit because they cant do anything about it
IAmA,not_removed,people keep on talking about costumes like its a thingthe characters are real guysjust accept it already whispers theyre totally normal people no different than you and i its weird seeing them walk around the utilidoor hallways in half costume with their wigs and makeup all done up just right
IAmA,not_removed,backstage areas arent really used for much more than breakslunches administration stuff storage etc security actually has nothing to do with any of the performers though every line of business has their own areas they keep to and we dont really interract with each other much
IAmA,not_removed,its a really exciting experience and you really get to meet a lot of great people on your program keep in mind that youll be working a lot and its not a vacationin disneys eyes youre here to work not party and stuff that doesnt mean you cant party on your days off enjoy the pools go to parks and explore the area while youre down here i highly recommend going to alexander springs if youll be here when its hot out if youre curious about anything feel free to pm me
IAmA,not_removed,were told to confiscate anything that could be used to make bombs or weaponselectrical tape fits that profile and they try to keep even the simplest of items out of the park
IAmA,not_removed,i assume so but not many people are gonna go out of their way to tell people they did it
IAmA,not_removed,oh man theres a bunch that goes into it but i guess it really depends in youre a huge planner or the kind of person that goes with it if i were you id buy the park hoppers meal plan resort plane tickets through disneyit might be a bit more expensive but well worth the peace of mind make dinner reservations and fast passes asap they go quick especially the popular rides so just nip that in the butt personally the best way to save money is by staying at the allstar resortits not nearly as nice as the other places but its way cheaper and you really only sleep there most of the time youre at the parks so why spend thousands of dollars going to a deluxe resort that you barely stay at another option to save money is to skip the park hopper and stick with park per day that youre there but thats your preference
IAmA,not_removed,definitely over this last summer when the kid got attacked by an alligator on bay lake the family was staying at the grand floridian and decided to take a stroll on the beach at dusk during mating season and the kid was attacked and pulled into the water that kinda takes the cake for me
IAmA,not_removed,ill definitely say that at the end of the day disney kinda slips up with their security around the value resortsthe management definitely doesnt seem to care as much as they do at deluxe resorts and its a shame
IAmA,not_removed,i honestly didnt think about that and probably should have blanked it outin all honesty now that you mentioned it im kinda paranoid
IAmA,not_removed,disney is definitely a target place for people like that as well as thieves people will come on property and usually go to resort pools to prey on children because theyre an easy target additionally people are super sneaky and scope out stuff to steal on pool decksthe lifeguards and recreation staff usually keep a great lookout for people like this and do frequent magic band checks to ensure anyone thats not allowed in the resort areas are escorted off property
IAmA,not_removed,no the real police are called they simply are not what your expecting a simple google search will answer your questions further
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt even know that was a thing for starters secondly i work for the company walt is more of a pop culture figure for the company these days and i dont really feel like walts view on other cultures or ethnicities regardless of who expressed admiration for him should reflect on the views of what the company and its employees stand forthe two kinda have nothing to do with one another ya know
IAmA,not_removed,im confusedyou were trespassed off property but secutity personel talked to you about a potential job out of curiositydo you care to elaborate on why you were trespassed off property
IAmA,not_removed,definitely check him out he wasnt a security guard but he was an employee
IAmA,not_removed,i actually find this surprising i feel like itd be some teenage prick
IAmA,not_removed,diddid you have sex in the park
IAmA,not_removed,it took way longer than it shouldve for me to get that first part
IAmA,not_removed,my friend metrowest
IAmA,not_removed,dave
IAmA,not_removed,actually wdw has some of the best video analytic security cameras there are physical security does not really do much to deter criminals the analytics can do amazing things hey that bag hasnt moved in minutes lets send an alert and have someone check it out hey this person just crossed this area that is off limits lets send an alert and have someone check it out once you cross the entrance to wdw there will not be that many sos walking around they rely on their camera network to be their eyes and ears quite effective actually
IAmA,not_removed,maybe dont give away their security practices opsec
IAmA,not_removed,so basically disney takes all the fun out of being a security guard typical disney p
IAmA,not_removed,interesting especially because over here its illegal for an employer to restrict ones right to self defense
IAmA,not_removed,seems like such a waste of a ticket shit aint cheap
IAmA,not_removed,i was surprised too given how many times ive had to tell people there isnt alcohol in mk other than be our guest at dinner with wine another guy followed him to the restaurant and told me he witnessed the man drink vodka on dumbo and security was there within minutes
IAmA,not_removed,great answer
IAmA,not_removed,oh boy
IAmA,not_removed,yea i work at a hospital we have several of these mostly faking ours lay in the road by the homeless shelter saying anything to come in
IAmA,not_removed,i should feel bad laughing at this on her own will she goes there just to have seizures oh my god i cant
IAmA,not_removed,how does she get in does the lady have to pay for a ticket
IAmA,not_removed,unladen
IAmA,not_removed,nice i live in south florida by the way i see so many sexy latinas
IAmA,not_removed,im fairly certain its on a track ive ridden it a few times and its always the exact same
IAmA,not_removed,yeah thats what ive heard about too but now the tower of terror is gonna be a guardians of the galaxy ride did you hear about that
IAmA,not_removed,i was selected every single time for an entire week at the disney parks whats up with that
IAmA,not_removed,interesting to know its random my husband and i got pulled for extra screening more than a few times i always thought it was because we dress up as in dresssuit not costumes for the parks so were kind of conspicuous im so sorry people give you trouble about your job i read some disney vacation planning forums now and then and see people talking about how its all security theater and is just to make people feel safe and blah blah blah
IAmA,not_removed,awesome thanks
IAmA,not_removed,lol wait for a terrorist attack and they will find him
IAmA,not_removed,yes but are you always a bag checker and do you get assigned specific parks or entry points
IAmA,not_removed,cut off his head for bringing the bad news
IAmA,not_removed,haha thats awesome
IAmA,not_removed,hears the whispers wait there not real c
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the response
IAmA,not_removed,dont worry im sure no one noticed except for me of course i only noticed because im a former mickey cop keep on protecting the magic
IAmA,not_removed,yes i was told not to go on disney property as i was under investigation at the time i apparently found my way to disney property some how and was apprehended and detained and interviewed for hours and released in a cab back to vista way and was told to evacuate in
IAmA,not_removed,i was ready to tell my husband they look for mouse traps in our bag at disney before i got it
IAmA,not_removed,nope not dave
IAmA,not_removed,i dont feel like i have give away any security procedures
IAmA,not_removed,yeah basicallyin training they stress that our job is to observe and report and thats it honestly being a security officer at disney sounds way more glamorous than it really is
IAmA,not_removed,pretty much me personally ill roll up in the fetal position and pray that my attacker feels immediate compassion and quits stabbing me
IAmA,not_removed,cant say ive ever done acid but from what ive heard id imagine its something i could appreciate
IAmA,not_removed,dealing with the heat and children and the long lines i can barely handle disney sober these days
IAmA,not_removed,it really isnt worth even trying you could risk it and hope the bag checker misses what your hiding but is it really worth getting banned from disney and going to jail nahjust leave it at home or in the car
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely people sneak vodka in water bottles frequesntly enough but if youre not acting a fool and being belligerent were not gonna get called out to youbasically be a responsible adult please for the recordim kinda a big fan of bringing chips to the park and going to pecos bills to make a huge pile of nachos for free
IAmA,not_removed,propaganda answer he could have given us the names removed version of a story about one of his bros but he shilled mickey the rat
IAmA,not_removed,i mean i feel bad laughing at it as well but ya cant help it i get why she does it it makes sense but its just such a hassle and an inconvenience
IAmA,not_removed,the boardwalk and disney springs are open to the public and dont require tickets upon entry
IAmA,not_removed,i absolutely believe it i havent made my way down there yet but ill be making my way to the keys here pretty soon
IAmA,not_removed,for sure it seems extremely smooth and the drivers seem to know how to drive it without even looking so i assume its on a track
IAmA,not_removed,i did actually apparently theyre taking stitches great escape out of here and replacing it with a wreck it ralph show or something but thats just what ive heard
IAmA,not_removed,its not just you it really depends on the time of day you show up if you get to a park and theres not a huge line chances are youre gonna get selected because were able to select the majority of people that come into the park if you vome when its crazy busy the chance of being selected is lesslike i said its random and we dont profile anyone
IAmA,not_removed,youd be surprised how many people think we profile and stuff like that and no matter how much i tell them its random the refuse to believe it its definitely not security theater though if people were to realize how often we have gunsdrugsknives trying to snuck into the parks theyd understand why we do what we do just do us and yourself a favor and be cool about metal detection and bag checks dont make shitty remarks and be rude
IAmA,not_removed,doubt it not with our high class security officers here to save the day
IAmA,not_removed,not always checking bags but of the time im at my specific park if im not checking bags ill be on patrol of the parking lotgatespark patrol or ill respond to calls from bag check to lock away prohibited items for guests our typical day if were not checking bags is literally just us walking around observing and responding to calls from base or other officers not a whole lot of action really goes on on the day to day though
IAmA,not_removed,from time to time we gotta have character doubles because mickey or any of the other characters sometimes have to be in more than one placebut theyre all real promise
IAmA,not_removed,haha im not surprised in the least people have stolen phones purses wallets shoes magic bands and even food the guests bring down in coolers its really disheartening though to see guests have their stuff stolen especially because people assume disney is the last place stuff like this happens just a general rule of thumb dont leave valuables unattended and dont be naive
IAmA,not_removed,i knew it was you you said you would call
IAmA,not_removed,give us some sort of hint
IAmA,not_removed,understandable many people come in and use the topping bar and the topping bar only and some cms even eat toppings as their meal on break
IAmA,not_removed,what about the big steam paddle boat though
IAmA,not_removed,that sounds awesome i wanna go to wdw now whats epcot like
IAmA,not_removed,i figured it wasnt security theater but i also imagine theres a lot more security stuff happening behind the scenes like disney undercover security officers that guests dont really know about to help too and of course we know youre just doing your job and are happy youre there to help keep the parks safe extra screening and bag check doesnt even take that long anyway and hell youre at disney world you know
IAmA,not_removed,its definitely not security theater though if people were to realize how often we have gunsdrugsknives trying to snuck into the parks theyd understand why we do what we do i disagreed until you check of the people it is just false security so ya it is a security theater cause i know a few people that have gone to disney armed in the last few months and yes they know they are taking a risk of being selected so if the good guys can still get in i am sure the bad guys can too
IAmA,not_removed,i thought you couldnt touch guests
IAmA,not_removed,and lasers with robits
IAmA,not_removed,that makes me wonder because i remember that gaston too and he looks different than the guy in the news btw i was around july there
IAmA,not_removed,is it really you i never called because you stole my pants that had your number in the pocket i would have called thoughbecause i really liked those pants and it would have been cool to get em back
IAmA,not_removed,hey unrelated but go mets
IAmA,not_removed,i work days at ak
IAmA,not_removed,the one that goes around tom sawyer island in magic kingdom
IAmA,not_removed,its actually my favorite park here because of the aquarium ive always had a huge passion for diving and stuff so im a big fan if going and watching all the fish swim aroundits oddly relaxing with headphines in and listening to chill music other than that epcot has soarin and test track which are both really great rides going around the world showcase is fun if you can afford to drink around the world a lot of people dont know it but the big golf ball lookin thing is actually a ride
IAmA,not_removed,your friends are the reason why were upping securityknowingly bringing a weapon onto disney property is illegal and and theyre being assholes your friends are not the good guys this is the reason were trying to go to do us all a favor by stop blatantly breaking the law and trying to justify it
IAmA,not_removed,we can carry them out my their arms and legs if theyre causing a disturbance thats pretty much it
IAmA,not_removed,lets get it
IAmA,not_removed,mmm i dont think so the one near the hall of presidents that goes across the seven seas lagoon or what have you the really big one that holds a hundred or so i think thats what op in this thread was asking i assume theres no track though
IAmA,not_removed,yeah thats what i was trying describebadly lol
IAmA,not_removed,aw man i wanna go so bad i didnt know that the golf ball thing was a ride also just a few more questions i came up with what parks are you assigned to do you watch over all of them how expensive is it to go like to go to every park
IAmA,not_removed,your friends are the reason why were upping securityknowingly bringing a weapon onto disney property is illegal and and theyre being assholes your friends are not the good guys this is the reason were trying to go to do us all a favor by stop blatantly breaking the law and trying to justify it there is no florida law that says guns are not allowed at disney it is a company policy that disney is enforcing with metal detectors if i am wrong state what law they are breaking
IAmA,not_removed,o
IAmA,not_removed,guck the fiants
IAmA,not_removed,the ferry that goes between the ttc and mk is not on a track
IAmA,not_removed,im statused at animal kingdom but i can work anywhere on property in a position im qualified forlike i couldnt do undercover stuff or anything its definitely not cheap to come here if you and someone else come for a week and you stay on property with a meal plan and park hoppers it runs you around everything included park tickets are between per day depending on the park but you can buy a park hopper and go to any park per day for about
IAmA,not_removed,orange county police dept will arrest any person that is caught with a gun or weapon in the parksif your friends get caught they will go to jail it is illegal to bring a weapon onto any private property without permission
IAmA,not_removed,law of common sense maybe
IAmA,not_removed,wow thanks for answering my questions and thanks for your time it was really nice to get to know you
IAmA,not_removed,orange county police dept will arrest any person that is caught with a gun or weapon in the parksif your friends get caught they will go to jail given floridas gun laws private landowners such as disney can restrict visitors from carrying firearms on the property and directing those who violate park policies to leave — but disney cannot press criminal charges if the owner legally possesses the weapon it is illegal to bring a weapon onto any private property without permission section florida statutes does not state carrying a weapon onto private property is illegal it only becomes a felony of trespassing with a firearm if you are asked to leave and refuse in florida a sign carries no weight of law so stop spreading lies that it is illegal it is not illegal it is against company policy but if you break any of disneys policies they do have the right to issue a lifetime ban and most times they do
IAmA,not_removed,totally right but that means id have to actually remeber the name heyooo
IAmA,not_removed,not a problem glad to do it
IAmA,not_removed,it is illegal and you canwill be arrested for it because guess what genius disney owns their property not the state of florida therefore they have the right to have you arrested for bringing an illegal weapon yes illegal even if you rightfully own it on their property you can argue all you want but in the end youre wrong and havent done any proper research on this topic think before you speak type
IAmA,not_removed,this ama is very underrated
IAmA,not_removed,well a friend of mine and i i dont know about you man but i know the names of my friends
IAmA,not_removed,how awesome is johnny depp
IAmA,not_removed,do you mean dead mans chest the screenshot is from dead mans chest
IAmA,not_removed,how much did it pay being that it took months of your life to shoot what was the process you took to audition and land the role
IAmA,not_removed,seeing as how you were how does it feel to have reverseaged years in an hour
IAmA,not_removed,on a personal level what are a few of your favorite films
IAmA,not_removed,what was it like being on set
IAmA,not_removed,why didnt they stop after the first movies

IAmA,not_removed,wow thats so awesome shes perf 😍😂 thanks for answering my questions
IAmA,not_removed,he has a face reveal hes shown it lots even streamed drunk for like hours
IAmA,not_removed,ohhh he is my top horror narrator on youtube but we all have seen his and his httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcoejqgbfrta
IAmA,not_removed,as an answer to your third question he is and knows that its satire even though a majority of its users including myself actively support him
IAmA,not_removed,no bring frauke petry reurope would have a mental breakfown
IAmA,not_removed,because i dont want to start a shitstorm over there ill ask this here now why why support an eu bureaucrat of the second worst major party in germany i was hoping our youth would be different from the old people who narrowly will always vote cduspd
IAmA,not_removed,that isnt proper proof
IAmA,not_removed,is this just a plug for your book or or you going to explain the discovery is it something to do with energy levels and electrons
IAmA,not_removed,hi jixfix your post has been removed because if this request were fulfilled it would be in violation of our posting guidelines which are listed in our sidebar to the right sg please contact the mods if you need further assistance
IAmA,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomuseraceofbase official channel as far as i can tell
IAmA,not_removed,you forgot to ask how they feel about the neonazi undertones of happy nation
IAmA,not_removed,first cd i ever got no questions though
IAmA,not_removed,it was the sign did you not listen to the song it was the sign and it opened up her eyes dude life is demanding without understanding she saw the sign i always assumed it was men at work
IAmA,not_removed,well if memory serves one of the guys in the band was a member of a white nationalist group some time before
IAmA,not_removed,sorry i thought i had put this under askreddit my bad
IAmA,not_removed,i think i know what a point and click game is so i am going to say no but i have done voice over for the following video games on google play family guy minecraft deerhunter subway surfers and candy crush and can answer your questions adventure games you have to yell constantly the same thing over and over again and your voice tends to go out when you do voice over video games you tend to do them on a thursday and friday so that if you have another gig your voice isnt completely out and you have the weekend to recuperate yes i absolutely love it and constantly look for more work the pay is okay depending on who does it and if they are union nonunion they give you a flat fee and thats that the google play games mentioned above had an initial residual but when they upgraded some of the games it became a pay out of a flat fee again it depends on if its union or nonunion the first game was family guy and they liked it so much they had me do the others so the answer is yes yes when the games were upgraded i did a small recording on some new words and features hope this helps
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,hi brooke what does tony shaloub smell like also you are super hot thanks for being there for me during the teenage years

IAmA,not_removed,hi brooke would you ever host a show like wild on again also ive noticed your fans are obsessed with your feet on your instagram do you take that as a compliment
IAmA,not_removed,hi brooke weve just a few more months to go for the celebrity apprentice with you and arnold what can you tell us about your time with schwarzenegger on camera and off was arnold intimidating and can you share any celebrity apprentice stories or challenges
IAmA,not_removed,brooke how do you stay fit what exercises do you do and how often do you sneak in some junk food and what music do you listen to while exercising and did arnold encourage the celebrity apprentice staff to exercise
IAmA,not_removed,who did you bond with the most on celebrity apprentice did you make new friends and does arnold always make grand appearances like arriving on a tank chopper or horse or does he keep his arrivals rather casual and whats your top favorite arnold movies
IAmA,not_removed,hi brooke if you had a day off with no kids or hubby around how would you spent it
IAmA,not_removed,your show hidden heroes is all about random acts of kindness for total strangers irl would you ever do an episode highlighting acts of kindness online like on rrandomactsofpizza
IAmA,not_removed,where did the idea for hidden heroes come from whos the most inspiring person youve met through it
IAmA,not_removed,you highlight hidden heroes on the show but i am wondering if you have one in your life or have ever experienced a memorable random act of kindness first hand
IAmA,not_removed,other than working being with your family and working outis there a hobbypassion you enjoy doing
IAmA,not_removed,big fan im a cat person and an animal lover too whats the silliest thing your cat has ever done
IAmA,not_removed,im so in love with you when are you going to relaunch wild on that show got me through my teenage years winkwink

IAmA,not_removed,star wars or star trek and have you given your halloween costume any thought yet
IAmA,not_removed,hi brooke big fan thank you for taking the time to do this ama what was it like to work with jane seymour and whats the story behind your tattoo best of luck on the apprentice
IAmA,not_removed,whats the weirdest thing a fan has asked of you but you still obliged
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever hit a guy in the balls accidentally or intentionally like during dancing or wanted to what happened and how did he react
IAmA,not_removed,greatest gig ever truly an adventure of a lifetime im an adrenaline junkie and the show was the perfect set for me to try anything and everything i miss those days lets bring it back by the way i was pregnant during the first season so my favorite part of the show was the travel and culture im not much a partier myself
IAmA,not_removed,celebrating good deeds is at the top of my list and i appreciate the opportunity to bring deserving stories to life and to show people that there are heroes everywhere
IAmA,not_removed,funny enough more people want pictures with the mirror ball trophy than with my own family when visiting my mirror ball trophy is in my closet but it has rotated throughout all of my childrens bedrooms it is one of my most prized possessions
IAmA,not_removed,its important for children to be brave enough to find their own voice and i think that charity work is cool i think leadership means you have the opportunity to influence other people theres nothing more powerful than making a difference
IAmA,not_removed,tom bergeron remains a lifetime partner and dear friend i loved our time in the ballroom together what i appreciated most about his hosting skills was his humor and spontaneity and most importantly his confidence to remain calm during chaotic live situations
IAmA,not_removed,when i was years old i was discovered randomly by a modeling agent then i won an acting scholarship that sent me to los angeles i studied broadcast journalism in college but my real experience came on the job during my first tv stint on a show called wild on on e it still remains the most fun ive ever had on a tv show
IAmA,not_removed,i feel really blessed at this point in my career to be part of a meaningful show and although i love the energy of live television i experienced in the ballroom this show has deep family values and i love feel good television the opportunity to have open dialogue with my children about doing the right thing is very important
IAmA,not_removed,very tough question from traveling the world to epic rock n roll to the glitz and glamour of the ballroom now i find myself discovering heroes everywhere its been a very fulfilling career and now im thrilled to be hosting hidden heroes
IAmA,not_removed,watching monday night football in a pub eating cheeseburgers and drinking beer dunking a basketball having my son look like me for a day because we all know hes a copy of david charvet thats all i can think of
IAmA,not_removed,one small town girl who changed the course of many young girls lives in uganda i was blown away to realize that a small idea can make a big difference in the world
IAmA,not_removed,if i could choose a super power it would be to teleport because la traffic is driving me mad i spend more time carpooling my kids than i do in the kitchen not cool
IAmA,not_removed,im not allowed to share much or he might terminate me but i love the language of business and advertising and it was a thrilling experience for me because i was competing for operation smile which is my personal charity i was on a mission i played the game of celebrity apprentice for a much more important reason than just television and i cant wait for people to meet the business woman in me as far as arnold goes of course it was intimidating to have the terminator as your boss
IAmA,not_removed,i teach a class in malibu called booty burn which is a rhythmic body sculpting class its a passion project of mine i also do soul cycle and yoga all of my workouts are equally for my mind and spirit as much as my body i sneak in junk food when my body is really craving it on most days i have a disciplined eating plan but i do believe in cheat days
IAmA,not_removed,i did make new friends laila ali and i connected on the show i have great respect for her for many reasons matt iseman was a new friend that i met during the show as well carnie wilson always cracks me up she and i met on the set of breaking bread and i adore her the rest youll have to watch and see
IAmA,not_removed,what does that look like lol i would actually finish my cup of coffee in the morning without having to reheat it three times i would catch up on morning news and take a yoga class i would read i believe in the value of me time but as a mother of and working woman its very difficult to carve it out
IAmA,not_removed,ricky paull goldin approached me with the idea and i instantly loved the concept ezra frech is a young boy that attends my childrens school who has a prosthetic leg he hasnt missed a beat in life hes a talented and capable athlete with the spirit of a warrior and he is truly a great example for all
IAmA,not_removed,i make it a practice to surround myself with kind people but as far as heroes go right now i am honoring my children for their charitable efforts as i watch them fundraise in our community it makes me very proud they understand the power of small effort
IAmA,not_removed,i love teaching my booty burn class but one thing that people might not know about me is that i love to paint although im not a trained artist its a passion of mine
IAmA,not_removed,strangely my two german shepherds are afraid of my cats my two rescue cats rule the house even a malibu coyote would turn the other way from them
IAmA,not_removed,aint your momma by j lo too good by drake anything by prince work by rihanna locked out of heaven by bruno mars
IAmA,not_removed,i think a bully is as powerful as they are allowed to be children need to learn how to problemsolve by using their own voice if and when thats not effective they need to feel comfortable enough to ask for help this may come as a surprise but i think bullies need help as well the most important thing is to bring all of it to someones attention we have an antibullying program on hidden heroes this season that we talk a lot about
IAmA,not_removed,my dream show would be super soul sunday im a big oprah fan and that show inspires me week after week much like hidden heroes it brings compelling stories to life
IAmA,not_removed,my favorite schwarzenegger movie is kindergarten cop i much preferred to imagine him in that role as opposed to the terminator when we were sitting in the board room my accent sucks
IAmA,not_removed,thanks brooke
IAmA,not_removed,conversely what advantages physically do you see being a girl instead of a guy
IAmA,not_removed,cant help it its one of my favorite brands
IAmA,not_removed,as a former aa employee i would love to hear about this as well i left the company several months after paula took office as ceo and got out of it while i could im curious to know what things are like now
IAmA,not_removed,ryan holiday did an ama here a few months ago and before you may be able to message him hes the former cmo although probably more famous for his other stuff than working at american apparel
IAmA,not_removed,just looked it up that was really interesting thanks
IAmA,not_removed,hes done amas i believe just so you know i think hed do another one for sure last one was a year ago but in the meantime you might wanna scroll down those ones
IAmA,not_removed,if like to hear a rebuttal to video about the hyperloop issues
IAmA,not_removed,he will do one before the reflight of the reusable falcon not sure if it will be on rspacex or here but keep an eye on it i believe the reflight will happen sometime septemberoctober around there cheers
IAmA,not_removed,im just hoping this isnt a long con and that hes not secretly a super villain he totally has that super villain vibe whilst doing super awesome things
IAmA,not_removed,yes yes yes holy shit so many questions i believe elon musk is an alien that has been sent here to help us save ourselves
IAmA,not_removed,since youre nicholas tesla reincarnate where is rasputin right now
IAmA,not_removed,from months ago
IAmA,not_removed,okay im definitely not elon musk but the biggest flaw and that video is that he misinterpreted a low pressure environment for a complete vacuum this is what he talks about for a solid minutes in his video secondly musk is a genius that has made multiple multi billion dollar companies this versus what a high school science teacher thinks makes me believe in whatever elon is thinking will happen ninja edit this is still a very will written video but i have more faith in musk
IAmA,not_removed,i believe elon musk is an alien that has been sent here to help us save ourselves
IAmA,not_removed,i love this idea and thanks for doing the ama what made you want to start a charity also what portion of the nomad convoy income is going to the charity
IAmA,not_removed,how did you arrive on deciding to make the trip available to participants creates some economies of scale but will surely bring challenges to in forming strong group cohesion in such a short period of time risk of it also feeling too much like a tour bus kind of trip what kind of allocation of time did you have in mind between time for folk to work and other activities looks like an incredible trip africa is a forgotten continent even to nomad types youll be playing an important part of spreading some good stories that will bring more people away from chiang mai
IAmA,not_removed,thanks i started the charity after having met mama dolfine the founder of the center we support in i supported her since but things derailed in when her husband passed away and so i decided to support her and her children permanently thanks to the amazing community and our incredible volunteers we made it this far nomad convoy is committed to sponsor education for children per ticket thats about
IAmA,not_removed,hi keith the idea was to have trucks and make it a convoy with people per truck the trucks have space for but we give people space the number also seemed great to do little festivals along the route but actually things just changed and we reduced the total number to trucks and participants we came to a similar conclusion and rather have a smaller group that connects well and trucks still make a nice convoy exciting times
IAmA,not_removed,how crappy is africa how violent and particularly niggardly things happen
IAmA,not_removed,hi dontmakemenonermind your post has been removed because your post has been removed because it lacks adequate proof unfortunately the links or photos youve posted could have been posted by anyone and they dont prove that you are the person doing the ama your proof needs to be something that connects the fact that youre doing an ama with your identity this could be something like a photo of you showing what youre doing the ama about with a sign that has your username and the date it could also be documents partially redacted if desired with a note that has the username and the date please let us know when the proof has been added by replying here and well put the post back up cheers please contact the mods if you need further assistance

IAmA,not_removed,why does no one there know what anything is and why is it when i ask for something specific the employee pauses a moment and then asks what i am wanting to do and then try and show me something else when i clearly want something specific to do what i am trying to do for example my license plate was stolen so i went in to get locking nuts and bolts and an employee said why do you want those and i told them knowing what would happen and they took my to license plate bolts and nut sets basically do hd employees not understand that sometimes what we want to do is moot
IAmA,not_removed,where at in montana i was born and raised also what would you buy with your sweet discounts do you get sweet discounts
IAmA,not_removed,excuse me do you work here
IAmA,not_removed,what is the craziestmost scandalous thing youve had happen to you at work
IAmA,not_removed,why is it that every time my husband and i go to home depot or lowes or ace or an auto parts store i am ignored employees assume incorrectly that he is in charge of why we are there and im just there to pick out colors or whatever is there no training to address this issue the best i get is a good afternoon maam before i am ignored fortunately my husband gets in and always redirects them to me it seems ridiculous to me that no one in corporate has figured out that when a mixed gender group comes in make eye contact with everyone and then say something like how can i help you folks today the person who speaks next is the one in charge how do you address mixed gender couples how do your coworkers address them was there any sort of formal instructiontraining on the store policy for this any sort of instructionpolicy regarding subtle sexismracism etc towards customers very interested thanks for the ama
IAmA,not_removed,i have a question who cares
IAmA,not_removed,is the job market good in your town i suspect youll be shopping again soon
IAmA,not_removed,the first one i can answer pretty well home depot is huge items are being moved constantly but for the reason we dont know what items are sometimes is because those employees may not be in that department personally ive been asked questions about stuff in lighting when im in garden so i try to find an employee that knows what hes talking about and the home depot encourages their employees to inquire about the customers and their projects so thats why we always ask why you need a certain item
IAmA,not_removed,i am a home depot employee and i ask what you want to do or what you are working on so that i can figure out the best person in the store to assist you there are as many as different items available in the store where i work and of the time if i take a customer back to the license plate bolts we find the item they wanted that they had overlooked on the shelf if the item is not there i will find another employee that might understand what they need more than i do understanding what you want to do is far from moot it is critical to me being able to match you with the right person to find the solution i pause during the conversation because i am really trying to help you
IAmA,not_removed,this dude is do you really expect him to know about the stores products ladder hose rake shovel anything more is a bonus
IAmA,not_removed,as far as im aware we dont have discounts but if we did probably patio stuff and kalispell montana
IAmA,not_removed,why yes of course how are you doing today sirmiss can i help you find anything
IAmA,not_removed,ive only worked at the home depot for about weeks not much crazy things have happened to me yet but i can keep you updated
IAmA,not_removed,personally ive never encountered that problem if i see a couple together i just ask how are you guys doing today or whichever spouse is closer to me ill ask what they need help with we get trained to treat and help everyone equally but it will vary from employee to employee on how they treat the customers
IAmA,not_removed,how rude
IAmA,not_removed,haha this post was originally a joke or satire i just wanted to see if anyone actually did care
IAmA,not_removed,yeah the job market is pretty good and what do you mean by shopping again soon
IAmA,not_removed,yeah but if i go in and say hello where are the glazing points i mean i dont really think theres a reason to say what are you doing just sell me some glazing points
IAmA,not_removed,fair enough out of curiosity how much training did home depot give you in your specific department and to what extent did you have to know about gardening and gardening equipment beforehand
IAmA,not_removed,yeah this guy gets it
IAmA,not_removed,right i never said him specifically
IAmA,not_removed,no discount in store but discounts available through benefits package saved on a new ford and cash bonus paid to everyone twice a year more than makes up for it
IAmA,not_removed,come with me i need you to reach something on the top shelf
IAmA,not_removed,how extensive is that training
IAmA,not_removed,ill say a prayer for you tonight
IAmA,not_removed,as a hardware store associate i have no idea what glazing points are my first response would be to ask what they are so i can figure out which department theyd be in then id either find you the appropriate departmental associate or at least get you to the right part of the store
IAmA,not_removed,yes if i go in and ask for a plant that is good at filtering stale air thrives in the shade and is nonpoisonous to my cat do i have a chance in hell of finding an answer from an employee or is that info i need to know before i go in
IAmA,not_removed,when you apply online they have a few questions maybe like that deal with random department questions for example they showed a faucet and pointed at the aerator and asked what it was and gave different options so they do a small screening to see what department youre fit for so most employees in their department already have some knowledge on their department then with multiple employees in that department we can usually answer each others questions and learn from each other and for me personally being a gamer and coming from arizona i decided to do a vocational agricultural class my school offered at voag we learn a lot about plants and animals so i have a decent background on plants and fertilizers but small machines like lawn mowers and weed whackers i dont know a whole lot about yet because we havent had our class on small machines yet
IAmA,not_removed,not really when i say no one i meant no one i shouldnt have to ask different employees where something is that was what i meant
IAmA,not_removed,yeah for sure
IAmA,not_removed,sure just give me a minute to find a ladder and ill be right with you
IAmA,not_removed,about hours it goes and covers a lot
IAmA,not_removed,im so lost
IAmA,not_removed,you do realize that asking what something is and what you were trying to do are two completely different things right and back in the day you could walk into any hardware store and the clerk at the counter could help you with everything these new big chain stores crush those places and offer shitty products and service
IAmA,not_removed,this is another one i can answer d the home depot as far as im aware partners up with another company and they ship flowers we dont order any of them that they grewraised and we just sell them for them and get a cut for selling it for them thats why every week to two weeks we will have different plants and employees wont know where the plants are or what plants we have because the home depot dont order them we just get what the plant company gives us
IAmA,not_removed,haha im sure letsplaydrew has just the thing maybe some friendly catnip
IAmA,not_removed,i was hired years ago to water plants part time and now i am a dskey carrier with keys to the store you didnt ask for advice but if i may offer some get to know your coworkers so you will know can solve problems best and let the managing team know that you want to be full timemore involved if that is what you want they will not ask if you want a promotion or advancement but you will find great support behind you if you take the initiative to pursue it
IAmA,not_removed,hes saying youll be fired for posting this ama dunno if true but thats what hes saying
IAmA,not_removed,you think its hard to shop at those stores try working at one
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair those were much more smallers stores than home depot or lowes i know my store is about sq ft which is pretty large but usually if a customer wants an item i have no clue where it is ill just go to the computer and look it up or ask one of my supervisors that would know where it is
IAmA,not_removed,good for cats but not for what i want in the room it doesnt get much air circulation and has lots of vintage items that waft a bit of scent
IAmA,not_removed,cool thanks for that advice
IAmA,not_removed,yeah thats what i was thinking wasnt sure though
IAmA,not_removed,nah i have a much better job but i was somewhere far worse once
IAmA,not_removed,home depot isnt so big you shoudnt have an idea where things are being a smaller store has little to do with my point the point was the clerk knew what shit was
IAmA,not_removed,well duh i just redirect them in the general direction i couldnt tell you exactly where it is unless its in my department then i could take you right to the item
IAmA,not_removed,they drive always the same van they did do a mini series of episodes in italy france and england yes he drives sometimes
IAmA,not_removed,which lowprofile reps hold more power due to committee chair positions etc than most people would think
IAmA,not_removed,ok its mt and im here let the party begin
IAmA,not_removed,can i just say i decided to try sort by controversial and im very impressed youre taking the mean spirited questions sorry i cant vote for you as i live in nc but i would if i could
IAmA,not_removed,jared so happy to have you as my representative i know you support the concept of single payer nationally will you join the current bill as a cosponsor keep up the good work i also cant wait to see you in april once the house is in recess second question in your opinion why is the democratic leadership and democratic party as a whole so unpopular third do you still play lol edit as of rep polis has signed on as a cosponsor source
IAmA,not_removed,sounds like youre one of the few super achievers out there my question is what drives you
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis as a citizen from co i would like thank you for taking the time to speak with your constituents as opposed to a certain senator from co what type of support for cannabis regulation to you see from your fellow members of congress do you see this act gaining any major support from specific legislators that people wouldnt expect
IAmA,not_removed,since the rule about broadband privacy protection was rolled back as part of congressional review and that supposedly means the same rule cant be passed again what does the future of internet privacy as it relates to the votes that cleared this week look like could congress or the future fcc pass similar ruleslegislation that provide the same protections that were reversed or can the current congressfcc pass ruleslegislation that can at least restrict what isps can do with the data
IAmA,not_removed,what will it take to get congress to leave the internet alone
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared i am a constituent of yours and i just wanted to thank you so very much for signing the bipartisan letter to the dea urging them to halt their scheduling of kratom i emailed and called your office and i definitely felt that my voice was being heard and represented as someone who has used kratom for over a decade i really from the bottom of my heart thank you for protecting my rights and freedom this plant is enormously beneficial to me and many thousands if not millions of americans i appreciate that you are looking out for people like me and the rest of our community had you heard about kratom before the dea completely overstepped their authority and brought it into public discourse
IAmA,not_removed,hey mr polis have you ever seen this video of you singing about our lovely state i absolutely love it thanks jesse
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis i love boulder county and prize the shared values we have here but we live in longmont which means instead of having a cool hightech progressive representative our family is stuck in the district that time forgot i need some real talk here is there any chance at all of either the district swinging moderate anytime soon or longmont moving to the district after the next census dont get me wrong ill all about fighting the good fight but im old enough now to know when to pick my battles thanks and nice job on the bill today
IAmA,not_removed,how will the attorney generals stance on marijuana affect legislation
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis thanks for your service i was sad to move out of your district but am happily supporting rep degette as my new rep hotpotato question re rep devin nunes do his actions with the intelligence committee potentially rise to the level of being exposed to investigation by the ethics committee for conflict of interest if you cant answer that behind the scenes do most fellow committee members schiff nunes have the type of rapport that allows them to behind closed doors say dude wtf thanks and keep up the wonderful work on our behalf
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for being my rep mr polis what are your plans to fight president trumps recent executive order on climate change and the epa
IAmA,not_removed,so i have donated to your campaign in the past and have gotten your emails for years because you were the first politician to actually talk about bitcoin with some sense fast forward a few years to last month im wandering around boulder for the first time after a weekend of snowboarding and wondering why the hell i live in new jersey all of the sudden i see your office i knew you were co but didnt really know specifics and i am like god damn they have this guy too now you are on the front page of reddit i surely am your target demographic question how do you feel about regressive taxes that are meant to promote health wellness the environment etc in philly i live near philly we just implemented a per oz soda tax on all sugary drinks the problem is this includes anything with a sugar substitute sucrose high fructose corn syrup etc and there are many food deserts in philadelphia it is great for public healththe tax is used to fund public schools but the burden of the tax falls mostly on poor people who doesnt have access to grocery stores there is also some controversy on the soda companies saying they have to lay people off but that is all bs in my opinion propaganda to get it repealed i dont really give a shit about them they make so much damn money there are other examples such as the recent gas tax increase in my state of nj again it is good for the environment but really only hurts poor people money goes to a highway fund i constantly find myself torn when forming an opinion on these specific types of taxes and would appreciate your input i appreciate sin regressive taxes as long as the money goes to a good cause and have a way of addressing the sin alcohol taxes should go to prevention and treatment as well as marijuana thats great but where do we draw the line in what a sin is fossil fuels soda plastic bags where is the line where we switch to a progressive alterative higher corporate taxes of fossil fuels stricter regulations better health programs etc i guess what im asking is super broad and somewhat of a lost ramble its late on the east coast lay it on me jared
IAmA,not_removed,what are your thoughts on judge gorsuch
IAmA,not_removed,congrats on seemingly being both a decent human being and a congressman what are your thoughts on universal basic income
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for being accessible can you ask your colleague cory gardner to do the same i support your regulate marijuana like alcohol act how can we solve the concern of driving under the influence of marijuana alcohol intoxication can be determined by bac current law tests of the presence of marijuana in the system using tests that only confirm the presence of marijuana in the bloodstream science says that it may be detected in your blood up to days after consuming marijuana it is unlikely that anyone is under the influence days after the fact what science can be used to determine intoxication follow up how can we get more research going in colorado on how to better determine marijuana intoxication
IAmA,not_removed,can you be my rep too im stuck with chris collins it doesnt seem fair
IAmA,not_removed,what is your opinion on the electoral college
IAmA,not_removed,this guy for president
IAmA,not_removed,can we use the weed money to give our awesome state singlepayer healthcare i dont want to be uninsured anymore
IAmA,not_removed,do you like sandwiches if so whats your favorite type of sandwich
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think should be done to stop gerrymandering also what are the pros and cons of term limits for congress
IAmA,not_removed,i dont live in boulder anymore so you were never actually my rep but youre still one of my favorite ive got a couple of quick questions thanks for doing this ama theres been a lot of talk recently especially on the left about the best way to contact our representatives the idea that oh actually they dont read emails you have to call to have your voice count is the basis for projects like httpswwwcallsforchangecom and i figure it differs between reps but is there a best or worst way to make our voice heard with republicans controlling both the legislative and executive branches and having a lot of sway on the judicial with the current and any possible future vacancies what does that say about the system of checks and balances we rely on with a congressional majority in both houses it seems like they can pass any legislation they want without democrats having a formal say is that the case and if so what do we do before do you still play league of legends at all i remember first hearing about you through that subreddit years ago again thanks so much for your time take care
IAmA,not_removed,not a real political question but i sat right above the dems dugout at the congressional baseball game last year and we were screaming for you the whole night how do you sign up for that is there like a sign up sheet passed around the house floor or something
IAmA,not_removed,how nervous were you on your first day
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared csu alum here who always appreciated you stopping by in these uncertain times we all need to take comfort in our fermented beverages so hows the kombucha bill you introduced doing
IAmA,not_removed,hi mrs polis hope your evening is going well some questions would the decriminalization under your bill mean marijuana sellers could now deposit their cash in fdic banks similarly would the rule preventing drug dealers from deducting operating expenses eg rent utilities advertising salaries overhead etc on their taxes be circumvented if you had to entertain royalty by making sandwiches and hosting lunch describe the sandwich you would make and the luncheon you would put on
IAmA,not_removed,how often to you speak with our senators weekly never only bennet
IAmA,not_removed,representative polis ive been a fan of yours since you were on one of the late night shows a few years ago the daily show maybe do you have plans to go on again you are very well spoken
IAmA,not_removed,hello jared good work and thanks for being active and willing to face adversity what has been your biggest frustration mistake and what keeps you positive
IAmA,not_removed,hello senator co resident here i want to ask you your positionthoughts on offgrid living i know that some people who live on their own land prefer to take their own responsibility when it comes to shelter and energy in many places there are ordinances governing what can and cannot be done in this regard in other places like much of the san luis valley there are fewer restrictions and usually just a permit required to live in a non permanent residence i read a story recently that echoed concerns from citizens who were denied permits and essentially evected from their own land i believe the trend of living offgrid in tiny home earthships etc is growing exponentially with this growth there is at some point going to be a request from these people that their lifestyles are legitimate and should be permitted fully at least outside of urban areas so what do you think of this and where do you see room for improvement or protection for this demographic
IAmA,not_removed,now that trump has announced he wants to get rid of net neutrality what should we do to stop that how will we be able to build momentum for another large protest like in
IAmA,not_removed,waves from denver keep up the good work two questions how do you think this developing trumprussia scandal is going to play out do you think president trump will last a full term what is the best way we coloradans can resist and combat the trump regime thank you
IAmA,not_removed,thank you congressman for both doing this ama and introducing the bill as someone who is stuck with rep trent franks raz i am pleased to see that some of my fellow countrymen get to be represented by someone who isnt a hack my questions are as follows what role does the pharmaceutical industry play in lobbying against legalization in arizona the makers of fentanyl donated to the opposition campaign in the states legalization referendum that was on the ballot last november my understanding and i could be wrong is that they were in the process of developing a synthetic form of thc that they wished to sell legalized marijuana would hurt their bottom line such an example is rather narrow so im wondering if pharma as a whole tends to oppose legalization how much what are your views on decriminalization of other drugs when should a drug be criminalized and when should it not be should all drug offenders receive treatment as opposed to jail time if so what about cost considerations if not to what extent should the penal system seek to provide treatment thanks again
IAmA,not_removed,sorry im a little late to the polis ama party ive been tracking how you vote and thank you for always properly representing us our privacy laws or lack there of can impact our economy as seen when the eu invalidated the useu safe harbor agreement in us businesses including many in colorado invest significantly in privacy programs and then our laws or actions of security agencies undercut all of their privacy efforts what will it take for congress to think through all of the consequences of surveillance and antiprivacy laws
IAmA,not_removed,do you think that people who disagree with you have rational points of view but disagree or is it really all about the money i happen to agree with you strongly on both of those issues i think its self evident that our view is the correct view and cannot imagine viewing either issue from the contrasting point of view
IAmA,not_removed,why is the lack of net neutrality viewed as a good thing among your peers
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think blockchain will be used for in government in government agencies in government contractors how do you think blockchain will benefit those entities and how soon do you think asking for your gut nothing more that blockchain will be in common use for those entities and anything else interesting you care to share
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think our chances are of ever getting an independent redistricting commission in colorado
IAmA,not_removed,hello first of all thank you for the work that you do my question is not so much related the things that youre fighting foragainst but id like to see what your perspective is being someone on the inside q how do you feel about the increasing polarization or partisanship if you will between the two parties its representatives and its constituents do you think its healthy for our democracy for the two major parties to increasingly vote down the party lines regardless of what they or the people of the nation believewant q how do you view the current political climate when it comes to lobbying by large corporations do you view a large imbalance in influence when it comes to what corporations want vs what the public wants if you do see it as an issue do you have any ideas on where to begin fixing it thank you very much for taking time out of your no doubt busy schedule to talk to people on reddit
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared youre my rep and happy to have you i was pleased with how you pointed out that not a lot of republicans were defending the recent net privacy bill but instead were just voting due to the party questions how do i explain to my gop friends that job creation is actually done by content creators the websites and not by the isps why is there such a large disconnect there almost down to strict party line i have a hard time believing there are no conservative software engineers im interviewing around boulder for software engineering positions can i put you down as a reference
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared i doubt youll catch this comment im a colorado girl born and raised i want to thank you for this my dad worked his whole life in construction and when the recession hit he was laid off as construction company owners had to cut back the employees and take back some jobs onto their own plates when construction started heating up in colorado he started interviewing for similar positions and was typically not hired over younger candidates my dad is now a full time badged marijuana trimmer if not for the marijuana industry im not sure if my dad would have a job aside from my personal family i work full time at a veteran run nonprofit and spend lots of time talking to vets who have combat related trauma tbis and other injuries who find marijuana more effective than the pills they have been prescribed by the va so many veterans are thankful for your work please dont forget it finally we have a huge population of former military interpreters from iraq and afghanistan in colorado these interpreters wore american uniforms and risked their lives alongside our troops and many are credited directly with saving american veterans lives right now the state department is not scheduling visa interviews for interpreters because congress did not allocate enough visas there have been bills introduced to provide adequate visas will you vote to allocate additional visas would you be willing to meet some of colorados interpreters on a trip home
IAmA,not_removed,first let me say that youve been one of my favorite politicians for years and thanks for the ama would you ever consider changing your position on gmo labeling there isnt a single scientific or health reason to label gmos without a credible study otherwise every major scientific organization supports the safety of gmos without a credible organization otherwise hundreds of thousands of gmofree options are available including certified organic nongmo products other gmofree labels whole foods central market coops farmers markets csa boxes online shopping etc but if there isnt a single scientifically supported reason to label gmos the burden of cost should fall on those who want to pay more for an unsubstantiated lifestyle choice the poorest of americans shouldnt be forced to pay more for their food without reason gm labeling killed the gmo industry in western europe against the advice of the vast majority of their scientists and a year review by the eu the foremost antigmo activists recently its also worth noting that gmo labeling ballot measures have failed in every state in which theyve been proposedeven progressive states like oregon washington and colorado above all the label is somewhat arbitrary potentially causing unpredictable mutations in tens of thousands of genes but somehow manipulating a single gene is an outrage somehow they think these crops dont need a label but manipulation of a single heavily studied gene does its disingenuous for antigmo types to claim labeling is about the right to know when there are only a handful of gm traits but httpsenwikipediaorgwikimutationbreeding of mutagenically bred plants which have been used since the very beginning of organic agriculture labeling relies on exploiting to single out a single breeding technique that is safer than theyre fighting to ultimately force the poorest of americans pay more for food that uses more pesticide that farmers dont like as much that yields less and increases emissions why single out gmos
IAmA,not_removed,you ever smoke weed
IAmA,not_removed,as someone in the legal industry does this mean we would have to deal with privatized shipping i know the teamsters are trying to get the ability to ship currently in courts in ca but privatized shipping is a fucking nightmare right now also how do you feel about
IAmA,not_removed,i dont have anything to ask i just wanted to thank you for continuing to represent my interests even though i no longer live in broomfield lord knows that my ohio representatives arent edit apparently by subreddit rules i must include a question so here goes what can we the insignificant people do about the us vs them problem in politics today its incredibly difficult to get incumbents voted out so go vote doesnt seem to be working
IAmA,not_removed,congressman polis first off im a huge fan of no labels and the psc and their mission secondly as a potential new boulder student what do you recommend for entertainment and political activism on campus do you have a way for students to get involved with your office thirdly whats your take on gorsuch many people from co have praised him for his work do you think its possible for dems to get over garland what would help that process fourth and most importantly would you rather fight a horse sized duck or duck sized horses also is a hot dog a sandwich thanks again for doing this ama and i hope youll answer me
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis as one of your constituents i am concerned about your views on rape on college campuses you have been noted as saying that those accused of rape should be removed from the school without contacting the police or having a fair trial how is this fair to students who didnt commit a crime and how do you see it as a better choice than having the police involved
IAmA,not_removed,should zerorating services be outlawed they would seem to be a clear violation of netneutrality
IAmA,not_removed,hey congressman what are the major obstacles to successful regulation of marijuana
IAmA,not_removed,any plans on running for president in mr representative the democratic party needs a strong contender with mass appeal and i think your views policies and career would be quite popular amongst many americans ps i wish i lived in your district even though i dont think i could personally afford it stuck down here with lamborn instead
IAmA,not_removed,why cant we just decriminalize cannibis based on the fact that the origin of the laws were all based on racist propaganda used to further the agenda of primarily the dupont family to criminalize hemp and introduce inferior products like nylon for use in shipping and textiles
IAmA,not_removed,isnt it the exclusive authority of the fda and dea to identify specific drugs under the controlled substances act is there a precedent of congress adding or deleting a specific drug from the controlled substances schedules
IAmA,not_removed,go jared former constituent of yours would you ever consider moving to maricopa county to serve
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think about aca repeal repeal and replace or tweak and make better
IAmA,not_removed,what can we do to stop this nightmare how do we get money out of politics how do you feel about getting money out of politics thanks for your hard work dedication
IAmA,not_removed,can you state and defend your viewpoint on the internet history selling bill that went through the senate recently also less seriously although i still want an answer is peanut butter superior in the creamy or crunchy form
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis youve spoken about overturning citizens united during oral argument for the case counsel for the government suggested that it would be constitutional to ban a book if the book came out during election season im very uncomfortable with the government having this power am i wrong for being worried about this is there a way to redecide citizens united that covers election advertisements but not books ps you were the only dem i voted for last year keep it up
IAmA,not_removed,will you support the libraries that help your constituents apply for jobs access the internet provide books for children and adults community programming and the myriad of other services by signing the lsta and ial dear appropriator letters the number of programs that are at risk of being eliminated or reduced at co libraries is great and we need your support please save the imls
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared thank you so much for your ama i really appreciate the way youve responded to everyone in such a friendly and respectful manner ive got a question about campaign finance and voting reform while i personally support campaign finance reform getting rid of pacs overturning citizens united ending gerrymandering and changing our voting system from firstpastthepost to a system like alternative voting these seem like policies that are impossible to change considering that many representatives who have the power to change them often used these policies to get elected in the first place as someone who has ears on the inside do you think that campaign finance and voting reform is possible are many of your fellow representatives open to these ideas and how can a member of the public work to help make changing these policies possible
IAmA,not_removed,if medical marijuana is regulated on par with alcohol how will this impact individuals who are still serving time in co jails for weed what types of policies would you propose to help alleviate these unfair sentencings
IAmA,not_removed,how are you suggesting to regulate driving under the influence are you gonna do saliva test or how much thc is in the blood what about tobacco companies putting chronicles into the marijuana how much will that be regulated
IAmA,not_removed,ive alwyas thought it should be regulated more like tomatos why alcohol most of our alcohol laws are questionably effective
IAmA,not_removed,i work with a company that creates cbd extracts from hemp and therefore is able to legally ship to all the states weve been clinically proven to have thc my question when will the dea recognize this important and crucial substanceextract and stop sending the dea after people who simply want to improve their health is there an end in sight to the funding the dea receives in chasing these silly manhunts
IAmA,not_removed,i see that a majority of your campaign funding comes from venture capitalist groups and you are very involved in entrepreneurship policy while you might be trying to gain public approval by introducing bills like this one that dont have a snowballs chance of passing overall it looks like you are owned by corporate interests and represent those interests how is it that you wake up in the morning and convince yourself that you arent a fraud knowing you take money to represent companies instead of people
IAmA,not_removed,jared first thanks for doing this that said why bother with legislation like this when its not required it does not take an executive order or act of congress to legalize marijuana it takes the act of one individual with the power and authority granted to them to change the drug schedule the attorney general of the us the failure of the attorney general to legalize marijuana is criminal negligence at the very least it is not only within their authority to modify the drug schedule it is in the job description that such an individual must have the requisite knowledge to know that it should be rescheduled as it is required for the ag to have such knowledge as as the ag has not done so the ag is thus responsible for funding a foreign enemy the mexican drug cartels as well as the imprisonment of millions of nonviolent americans see title united states code usc controlled substances act subchapter i — control and enforcement part b — authority to control standards and schedules while i am glad you are trying to pass this current legislation i am disappointed that no inquiry into the actions of the ag have been made for either this current ag or eric holder the ag or the ag who is also culpable and guilty of criminal negligence with respect to the duties required of them when will an inquiry of these criminal actions which are affecting millions of americans take place
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared first off let me admit that ive not been a fan of yours dating back to the august primary i felt that joan in particular was treated unfairly and her years of dedication hard work were denigrated by becker your team i will also admit to being begrudgingly won over by your years of hard work since that election by your own dedication to being a legislator by all accounts youve proven to be a model of what we want in a representative but lets be real here you didnt just waltz into your seat the facts of as follows in you spent nearly million to win a seat on the state board of education defeating your closest rival alexander who spent about on the election the denver post the millionaires club why leave ballot initiatives to the rich august in the democratic primary election in colorados congressional district when you ran against former state senator joan fitzgerald and environmental activist will shafroth you spent million of your own money with your total spending for the primary reaching over million federal elections commission friends of jared polis committee quarter filing october fecgov daily camera polis wins dem nod august you set a colorado record with the most selffunding in state history during the election with your million in selffunding still standing as a state record denver post joe coors has spent million of own money on campaign october you mention campaign finance reform including getting rid of pacs but those same pacs represent workers as well as corporate interests how would this not just empower the wealthy to fund their own campaigns and put everyone else at a disadvantage you mention matching funds but arizonas matching funds have been struck down by the supreme court assuming though that would be overturned along with citizens united matching funds with caps essentially equal asking candidates to fight with a hand tied behind their back with no cap no one will want to do it
IAmA,not_removed,do you feel that anything should be done to regulate the real estate in your state from what i understand since legalizing marijuana you guys have seen a huge boom in prices that could put undue hardship on people already living there ie being priced out of an apartment you have had for years
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis seeing how colorado set the example for legalization opponents of this bill might point to interstate marijuana trafficking en masse or the uncertainty of testing thc impairment in drivers as a reason to vote against it do you have anything to say to naysayers in the house also there are plenty of veterans in our district that are happy youre our guy so thanks 👍
IAmA,not_removed,congressman since it looks like your colleague from the is going to make a run for governor who would you like to see replace him also what do you think its going to take to win the
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr polis i had an internship with your office during my junior year of high school at mapleton early college high school for personal reasons i regrettably could not continue the internship id just like to thank you for the great opportunity since i never got the chance to do so i learned an immensely valuable amount interning in your office and helping out with your constituents immigration cases its great to see you are doing well and still continue to be one of the good guys in politics your stances were progressive then good to see you havent changed we need people like you in government more than ever now keep up the good fight my question is this what do you think the young generations can do to have the most impact on our government right now it seems that in the last election especially the younger generations voices were drowned out unfortunately greetings from your former intern in thornton
IAmA,not_removed,is it possible to change the laws surrounding preemployment drug testing it seems to me that these tests mostly discriminate pot smokers and not the people who do heavier more lethal drugs as the heavier drugs tend to leave your system much quicker
IAmA,not_removed,my question is has the dea been meddling around in states where its legalized as sessions seems to suggest may happen
IAmA,not_removed,congressman ujaredpolis while youre doing brave things for pot legalization and privacy would you also please consider adding an amendment to legalize home distilling to hr last legislative session there was a bill that dealt with this hr congress i was very encouraged by the high number of cosponsors this bill had showing broad bipartisan support in both the house and senate including yourself there were cosponsors in the house sadly this bill never made it out of committee in short it would have eased the excise tax burden for thousands of alcohol related small businesses specifically craft breweries and craft distilleries as well as put homebased hobbyist distillation of spirits ie strictly for personal consumption never for commercial sale on legal par with homebased hobbyist production of beer and wine presently it is not legal to distill spirits in ones own home for any purpose whatsoever congressman erik paulsen of minnesota has now introduced hr which has similarities to the previously mentioned bill for excise tax relief however this new bill doesnt legalize home distillation of spirits i ask that you please amend hr to fix that problem today it is legal for us citizens to make our own wine and to make our own beer and has been since we can purchase possess and consume distilled alcohol however the process of taking the legal alcohol out of the legal wine or beer is forbidden to us by an outdated holdover of prohibitionera regulation this law no longer serves any purpose to the common good and must be changed to address concerns of potential illegal profiting from a repeal of this law referring to bootleggers and moonshiners specific provisions of the previous bill hr wisely retained prohibitions against the sale of unlicensed homecrafted liquor similar to laws concerning home brewing and winemaking those of us with similar interests believe this remains a commonsense approach as would a limit to the amount of product based on the number of household adults equalizing the legal treatment of hobbyist production of beer wine and spirits would provide evenhanded consistency in law for these directly analogous activities it would also protect individuals and families from overzealous regulation and wasteful and unnecessary prosecution furthermore it will without a doubt have a positive effect on the liquor industry and the economy as a whole as home brewing of beer and wine has already grown the economy by billions of dollars by spurring innovation entrepreneurship and competition in the market thanks
IAmA,not_removed,in regards to this bill given the past statements from jeff sessions on his opinion about marijuana one lifewrecking dependency for another thats only slightly less awful what is the realistic outcome of this is there growing support within the house for a bill like this
IAmA,not_removed,who are other reps you enjoy working with if you dont say mine i will be sad
IAmA,not_removed,hey jared we actually met a couple of years ago at the cu boulder umc it was election day and you won later that evening youre the most awesome politician i know what do you thinking states with legalmedical marijuana have to fear with jeff sessions past antimarijuana views what can we be doing as citizens to help our local economies and stop his possible justice department rules what can our legislators do thanks and keep on being the best dressed congressman in the house

IAmA,not_removed,how about we dont regulate alcohol or marijuana and let adults make their own decisions
IAmA,not_removed,hello im from colorado voted for you these laws and so on as they came fourth do you truely think congress is willing to act on this given the political climate of extremes now
IAmA,not_removed,do you think theres any chance of a mass clemency yes i made that up and yes i know im not technically using clemency right but youll see my point for people convicted or who pled to having very low amounts of painkillers and now have a felony on their record i had a long standing prescription for one type of opioid and then a friend gave me the rest of their bottle nine pills because she was done with them she knew i have a litany of painful health issues and she knew i get prescribed opiods its a long story but is there any hope for my future i went from working for ofa in iowa mo and ks to now having zero future in my dream occupation read politics or government i made calls for your reelection a few years ago and i wish i lived in boulder so you could be my rep ill still like you even if you ignore me or dont give a favorable response
IAmA,not_removed,jared i am a constituent scientist and a supporter how do we incorporate scientific literacy into policy if so much science is public funded why arent scientific journal accessible to the public we need to work on this
IAmA,not_removed,hi representative polis fort collins constituent here its always a pleasure to see you visit i have two questions for you a few months ago you wrote an excellent oped suggesting states should negotiate their own climate change policies such as independently enter the paris agreement as a college student im definitely worried about my future in regards to climate change how should colorado best work to fight climate change should we work with an international body such as the un or enter a new agreement with other states as cochair of the equality caucus and an lgbt representative yourself i am grateful as a queer constituent for your work in the house clearly political support for lgbt rights has diminished under the new administration and yet public support for lgbt rights has increased over the last few years there are a lot of laws that deeply concern me such as sexual orientationgender identity not being considered grounds for discrimination in personnel decisions healthcare access many of my lgbt friends use planned parenthood due to their accessible and non judgmental services accessibility of adoption and official documents that acknowledge gender identitynontraditional partners can these laws be passed on a federal level in the current political climate or will it more likely go through the states
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis its presently illegal to purchase a firearm if youre a marijuana user regardless of your individual states laws on marijuana does your bill address this restriction
IAmA,not_removed,why dont most of your coworkers give even a single shit about us
IAmA,not_removed,hello how is it the dea can agknowledge the facts of marijuana benefits and introduce a synthetic version yet marijuana is scheduled with no medical benefits cant the supreme court or a federal judge reverse its scheduling i dont smoke but i believe its very contradictory
IAmA,not_removed,so i will preface this by saying i am fiscally conservative and socially liberal and usually vote republican with that said ive voted for you every election since ive been able to vote because of the work youve done on many many things my issue though is you seemed to be much more independent when you first started maybe this isnt fair to you i see you are now constantly voting on increasing the debt ceiling even though you started out voting no on the stimulus package in and now seem to be towing the party line more often is this because this is what your voting population wantsi know boulder can be a tricky place for politics p is this you changing some stances on things over the years or a combination of both also has there been much talk about how a lot of the money from marijuana has been going to policing it and administration fees over schools i was pretty sure we were spending lots of money policing marijuana before also thank you very much for defending our internet privacy protections voting no on many more spending bills pushing for legalization of marijuana and all the work you do for peoples rights
IAmA,not_removed,do you like dank memes
IAmA,not_removed,which city in colorado should i move to but more seriously if you had unlimited amounts of money how would you safe the world

IAmA,not_removed,you are a hero fighting for the right stuff i went through a lot of comments to see if it was asked already but i want to get this question in what is the plan for people currently incarcerated for marijuana related crimes or they have an offense on their record if marijuana were to become legally recreational
IAmA,not_removed,rep polis since you represent one of the healthiest states in the country do you have any plans to work on any bills to regulate the pesticide industry more thanks for doing this ama

IAmA,not_removed,what are your thoughts about allowing bikes in wilderness as they were colorado has a lot of wilderness and continues to grow in a few cases cutting access to mountain bikes can you help add more trails to federal lands in co in general
IAmA,not_removed,how do we get more elected officials like yourself well you know besides the obvious like voting for them
IAmA,not_removed,i love you hmm wait sorry i need to ask a question why are you so great
IAmA,not_removed,why should google be allowed to sell user data but not isps
IAmA,not_removed,hey jared big fan of marijuana my question is simple if i were in a spacecraft that had achieved light speed and i were to turn around would i see pitch blackness due to light particles in the back of my ship not being able to reach my eye thanks for everything youre doing
IAmA,not_removed,please why money is so prolific and valued in politics as opposed to the desires of the people how can we get money out of politics so no singular wealthy person can shape our laws through our politicians
IAmA,not_removed,do you know rodney davis ril and if so how much of a douche is he in real life on a scale of to summers eve
IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for your work against sopapipa and for helping to represent blockchain technology properly in america this is a two part question do you ever use a vpn will you join us over at rkeepournetfree were a community that is not even a week old that has organized to fight to keep our net free
IAmA,not_removed,are you for real an actual representative for the people what would you do if there was an issue that you felt very strongly one way about but your majority constituency very strongly felt the opposite about you seem saneish so abortion is probably not an issue for you but what would you do if you were the rep for a rural area in mississippi
IAmA,not_removed,do you support a carbon tax on regular citizens or companies that produce it in mass
IAmA,not_removed,can you be my representative
IAmA,not_removed,representative polis i find myself living in texas my question is as follows any chance we could get a clone of you sent our way im afraid ive come down with a case of representative envy
IAmA,not_removed,why do you want to regulate marijuana like alcohol when the two substances are very different why not make different regulations for marijuana
IAmA,not_removed,why do you want to regulate marijuana like alcohol if its less dangerous
IAmA,not_removed,as a boulder native can you get rid or stop of the fracking frackenlooper that seems to be plaguing weld and soon boulder county that and tell cory gardner to go himself edit thanks for what you do
IAmA,not_removed,i live in louisville co how can i get involved in local government
IAmA,not_removed,what are the odds that this will be a success
IAmA,not_removed,who are some of your favourite republican representatives
IAmA,not_removed,whats the name of your nonofficial reddit account
IAmA,not_removed,so whats it feel like to be the only sane one on the boat
IAmA,not_removed,why do some representatives fight against net neutrality even though the national consensus party line or not is wtf is net neutrality idc is pro net neutrality is it really lobbying like the media portrays or is there some legitimate reason for this
IAmA,not_removed,im a broke as hell college student from out of state what can i do to help
IAmA,not_removed,good evening sir neil gorsuch has been nominated to the supreme court and hes been a judge in your district for a while what is your opinion on his nomination thanks
IAmA,not_removed,former coloradan here rep polis this may be a controversial question but what is your favorite mountain to ski in co
IAmA,not_removed,was there an iso or vpn that changed your spin on on net neutrality or did you just have a human and constitutional sense of whats right and wrong
IAmA,not_removed,jared i as a young student and many others in this thread probably are wondering what is in your opinion the way to live life and do you have any advice for a political sciences student like myself
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for doing what you do now where should i donate or otherwise help
IAmA,not_removed,not sure if this will get answered but what are your thoughts on legalizing gambling such as sports betting its another opportunity for billions of dollars of tax revenue for states and the first state to do it will have an even bigger advantage
IAmA,not_removed,how can i help if i am in texas to support the legalization and taxation of weed
IAmA,not_removed,have you considered running for president in the next cycle
IAmA,not_removed,what can we do to help
IAmA,not_removed,hello what do you think of other voting systems do you have a favorite to replace firstpastthepost
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr congressman what advice would you give for a young person looking to enter a career in politics have you ever decided to turn down a campaign donation from a personcompany that just didnt feel right and what made you come to that decision whats something that many congressmenwomen do that most people dont know about thanks in advance life long and prosper
IAmA,not_removed,is it actually worth calling the offices of congressmen and senators does it even make any difference i seriously doubt anyone called their representatives expressing a desire for their privacy to be invaded
IAmA,not_removed,why are your colleagues such cunts ive been watching a lot of jim jefferies lately
IAmA,not_removed,jared polis your no bullshit grilling of the dea chief a few years ago was amazing keep up the great work
IAmA,not_removed,given that almost all the republican senators have been given donations by isps to repeal the fcc regulations which would have provided some level of privacy for consumers would you be willing to table a law banning senators from lobbying for any corporation
IAmA,not_removed,what made you choose the public representative life and how does money from interests groups reflect your votes regardless of what the people you represent
IAmA,not_removed,mr polis if you get the opportunity to talk to rep pat meehan rpa can you tell him to listen to his constituents and not lobbyist
IAmA,not_removed,i just gotta say i think its awesome you use reddit i also want to thank you for signing that letter to the dea last year asking them to not schedule kratom im not a criminal and the dea shouldnt make me one or any of the other million americans that have used it for years decades that was an abuse of their authority in the first place since emergency scheduling was supposed to be for crazy new synthetic drugs that hit the streets not a plant thats millions of years old that humans have used for millennia so many people depend on it to relieve their chronic physical pain including myself it would be a terrible thing to take that away from them forcing them back onto actually dangerous pharmaceutical opiates or street drugs like heroin and on top of that turning them all into federal criminalsenemies of the state i mean jesus most of them are older people how many grandmasgrandpas are we going to throw into jail sorry for my rant i do have some questions though are you guys in the congress ever considering fundamental electoral reforms to enable more proportional and accurate representation to make more than two political parties viable what about removing the cap of and vastly expanding the house of representatives
IAmA,not_removed,representative polis im going to google you so i can get an overview and idea of how you started off in politics but i have a question that your wikipedia page probably cant answer when did you start aspiring to be involved with politics on a national level also what was it like when you were elected as far as emotions etc thanks for doing an ama and keep up the great work
IAmA,not_removed,my question in your opinion can we expect to see legalization nationwide or is the effort being stopped
IAmA,not_removed,i find lumping marijuana with alcohol to be unacceptable unless marijuana is given a much lesser status than alcohol in terms of intoxication effect substance control and beneficial use and vaster difference in terms of long term brain effects alcohol is a poison to the brain fun as it may be sometimes really the fact that our citizens have been lawfully isolated and punished for decades treated like outlaws and criminals should lead us to accept no compromises in this new set of changes that will inevitably take over it has been a disgusting injustice basically slipping marijuana right in with alcohol seems legally easier but its still a farce marijuana is less potent than kava kava sold openly without regulation on vitamin store shelves marijuana is less potent than many prescription drugs given openly to people of any tolerance without legal ramification marijuana should stand on its own and should be treated like a native plant that it is it should be separate from alcohol my question is is there not clear value to bypass the severely overcompromising bullhit of blatant overtaxation of marijuana and also the still far too heavy classification of marijuana in term of alchohol so many people have fought very long and hard for these measures why go soft now when they will just use any new standard to the max and use it to prosecute people on some level
IAmA,not_removed,mr representative before today i have never heard of you but now that i have i believe you will be on my radar in the future tanks for all you have worked on my question is what can we as citizens do to help keep net neutrality and broadband privacy
IAmA,not_removed,how would you suggest that someone in their midlate get involved with politics with the goal of perhaps eventually becoming a house representative
IAmA,not_removed,do you use cannabis yourself
IAmA,not_removed,broomfield resident here thanks for taking the time to respond to questions on reddit my question is about the medicare resident caps for the uninitiated the limits that were introduced in and havent been revisited in a loooong time the aging of the baby boom generation is producing an increasing need for healthcare generally the residency system however is an artificial bottleneck in the way of adapting to the nations need for more doctors the limitation is having significant impacts in fields like psychiatry where the recently expanded benefits for drug treatment are less effective simply because there arent enough psychiatrists to meet the needs of the community what is your position on the medicare residency limits do they need to be revisited should the funding be separated from medicare would you consider this to be a bipartisan issue or is there resistance to change it due to partisan politics any thoughts are welcome
IAmA,not_removed,i would say kevin brady rtx in charge of all tax issues chairman ways and means and rep rodney frelinghuysen rnj in charge of spending chairman appropriations and ill add the chairman of my committee the rules committee pete sessions rtx
IAmA,not_removed,dunno markets are markets im sure there will be some big players and some small players we have to make sure that any laws and regs are easy for small players to navigate there are lots of small liquor stores but also some chains it will probably be like that
IAmA,not_removed,i worked with the marijuana industry from the position of a government regulator until a couple of months ago and while i know there are plenty who are committed to producing what they feel are the best strains or at least one or two that theyre known for some see their current business as a means to an end ive spoken with quite a few grow owners who are just waiting for nationwide legalization with the hopeexpectation that major corporations will buy them out there really seems to be a visible division between people who see it as an investment opportunity and those who are invested in the culture as it were to be clear im largely ambivalent because i dont partake but i will say that ill be very curious to see what happens if it becomes a corporate industry there are a lot of people working in grows who are not going to fit into a suit and tie environment
IAmA,not_removed,i imagine this situation to be similar to the craft beer market vs big market beer ie coors miller etc the smaller more niche cooperations will thrive in specialty strains or other products while the bigger players will control mass general products
IAmA,not_removed,its like anything else in capitalism the bigger they are the lower the common denominator will be theres a reason wal mart does not sell high fashion clothing items the big players in cannabis will ultimately be those who cater to the cheapest lowest common denominator and do so the fastest when the bottom falls out of the market for the little guy itll be the boutique specialty shops that cater to a knowledgeable consumer with an artisan product who are left standing after the other ma n pas have gone out of business the problem is that any chode can pump out something exquisite the hard part is cultivating your consumer its not enough to say this is the best stuff come git it you have to educate wouldbe patrons without coming off as a psa look at successful examples in the craft beer market for the way forward they arent selling beer they are but thats the secondary product theyre selling a story this beer is made from previously extinct paleolithic grains that havent been sampled by mankind since dinosaurs last shat in the woods now you get to participate in this unique event
IAmA,not_removed,i lived nearby your office last year and would frequently park in your lot on the weekends would vote for you again
IAmA,not_removed,just wanted to say ive voted for you for years now and i feel as though you always have my best interests in mind from trying to stop sopa and pipa to health care to marijuana keep up the amazing work you are one of the only people in congress i actually want to stay in
IAmA,not_removed,im recently returned to co grew up here from oregon im super happy to have someone like you representing us what can i do to help
IAmA,not_removed,toga party toga toga toga
IAmA,not_removed,jared i know youre gone but i would love to know your plans for helping protect your constituents in your state since as of right now it is nigh impossible till midterms for the democrats to do anything to stop the republicans from doing what they are doing right now is there anything you can do in your home state to protect net neutrality ideals and privacy or is colorado suffering the same issues
IAmA,not_removed,oh i try to respond to them all especially constituents part of my job
IAmA,not_removed,hope to see you soon our tactic is rather than bring forward our plans for health care we want to first defend what we have it is under immediate fire there is no chance with the current congress to move towards medicare for all when i look at the democratic party being so unpopular you have to also consider that the republican party is just as unpopular i think people particularly younger people just strongly dislike parties in part because they are seen as topdown power structures so its not so much the democratic party as parties in general i love lol but havent played in a few months
IAmA,not_removed,runexpectedleagueoflegends
IAmA,not_removed,my chauffeur just kidding i dont have one i drive myself
IAmA,not_removed,there is much more support when a representatives home state has moved forward with legalization its a theoretical issue if its not happening at home now so many states have moved forward we have a lot more allies on both sides of the aisle
IAmA,not_removed,congress could certainly pass a law that resembled the rule but keep in mind this is the same congress composed of people who overturned the rule so not likely but yes if members of congress change their minds or a future election gives us a more privacyminded congress we can make broadband privacy the law of the land
IAmA,not_removed,new congress
IAmA,not_removed,it really came to my attention then i had read maybe an article about it and vaguely heard about it before but then i had to spring into action when they surprised us and im so glad it worked for now
IAmA,not_removed,id never heard of this plant before now i think ill read up on it thanks for mentioning it
IAmA,not_removed,yes its a really catchy tune love it i showed it to rep flemming and im not sure he knew what he was looking at
IAmA,not_removed,that louisiana rep is so full of shit
IAmA,not_removed,theres one you tube group whos gained a new subscriber
IAmA,not_removed,haha well you can consider me your honorary rep there will be a new census in and redistricting so you never know because co has increased in population we will add a seat and therefore all districts will shrink even though the district will shrink who knows maybe it will include all of boulder county in any event your district did have a wonderful democratic rep betsy markey for one term so it is possible in the right year
IAmA,not_removed,im in the same boat we are literally a short bikeride away from polis district its frustrating because its like on one side of hygiene you get this awesome rep doing great great things and then on the other side of that line you have like the complete opposite ideology in tea party member ken buck at least we get to enjoy blowing up his voice mail every day like we do what a shithead that guy
IAmA,not_removed,yeah but dont you get municipal fiber
IAmA,not_removed,not yet signed by the governor to allow all existing recreational licensing be instantaneously and retroactively converted to medicalmodel licensing in the event of federal enforcement sessions said he would specifically target recreational businesses but any crackdown is not gonna be some surprise attack his first step will be to rescind the a set of guidelines and law enforcement priorities put forth by the doj for states that regulate marijuana sales
IAmA,not_removed,on your second question i think that most of the members are more friendly and informal with one another behind the scenes if i had a problem with the chair of my committee i would definitely approach them informally and see whats up
IAmA,not_removed,weve already created tens of thousands of jobs in colorado growers dispensaries products but its also pumped money into alternative newspapers ads and real estate leases its been good for our economy
IAmA,not_removed,doing everything i can today introduced climate act along with several colleagues to prevent these new executive orders from being implemented of course its more an effort to use our soapbox because obviously he wouldnt sign these bills even if they somehow passed there might be some opportunities in tax reform too the real battle will be to defend funding for epa and renewable research and then work hard to elect a congress that cares more about the environment and climate issues
IAmA,not_removed,following
IAmA,not_removed,i am fine with sin or excise taxes boulder maybe your new home town just passed a sugary drink tax i think its regressive if it is on a sales tax of things that you have to buy but taxes on things like sugary drinks alcohol gambling are only taxes if you choose to pay them
IAmA,not_removed,i want to see more data and information on it its an intriguing idea
IAmA,not_removed,there are actually some good testing technologies but nothing is perfect an article about my efforts in this area
IAmA,not_removed,well i dont think that upstate ny will be added to my district anytime soon but hey you never know btw my mom is from peekskill
IAmA,not_removed,we should abolish it and directly elect our president
IAmA,not_removed,he has my vote
IAmA,not_removed,im down for that
IAmA,not_removed,he has my vote my donations and my volunteeringorganizing should behind him if he runs thats for sure
IAmA,not_removed,its not enough it is helping build and repair some schools though
IAmA,not_removed,while this sounds awesome as a fellow coloradan i fear people moving only to our state to take advantage of this if it was nationwide id be more of a believer in this idea im a democrat btw
IAmA,not_removed,dont love sandwiches hold the bread or just bread and no sandwich also good
IAmA,not_removed,is this a himym reference or are you actually asking about sandwiches
IAmA,not_removed,someone mentioned this earlier a ballot initiative like california passed would take districting out of the hands of politicians and give it to a nonpartisan commission i think it would pass in most places it was put on the ballot term limits pros are you get new blood in and have more opportunities for people to use their real world skills and knowledge cons are that it makes lobbyists more powerful as they become the institutional memory and you also lose historical knowledge
IAmA,not_removed,i think calls and letters from constituents are both great petitions dont do much same when i hear from people in other states we still have the judiciary also keep in mind that both parties are broad tents to we democrats werent able to pass everything we wanted when we were in the majority no immigration reform or carbon emission reduction and the republicans so far cant even seem to repeal obamacare which they have said they wanted to do for years
IAmA,not_removed,oh and i havent played in a few months
IAmA,not_removed,last year i didnt hit as well as usual neither did our whole team dmn knuckleballs we have begun baseball practice already and hope you can make it again this year we practice most weekday mornings am we recruit one another to play no list to sign you just show up
IAmA,not_removed,more excited than nervous
IAmA,not_removed,we are trying to get clarity for kombucha the fda at times has threatened to regulate it like alcoholic beverages which would make it much harder to buy and put many small companies out of business we have good bipartisan support and i think we can get our fix into the appropriate bill theres a similar law already on the books regarding apple cider it turns out that if you leave cider out it also ferments duh so they have a special exemption i actually had to talk to a fermentation professor at csu to explain all this to me to help craft the bill
IAmA,not_removed,focofocofocofocofocofocofocofoco i think hoursweek fundraising is average for me
IAmA,not_removed,also im mr not mrs but im flattered that my drag is so convincing
IAmA,not_removed,yes it would solve the banking issue we also have narrow legislation to solve that issue but it would be solved by the comprehensive bill the tax companion bill wyden and blumenhauer of which my regulation bill is a part would fix this tax issue well having it be for royalty kinda limits it arent that many royals around probably id host it for a bunch of micro nation kings they seem like an entertaining lot and id serve vegan food
IAmA,not_removed,i spoke to gardner last week id say i speak to him about oncemonth bennet sometimes i will speak with several times a week and other times it could go a month or more not seeing him or talking to him so on average bennet onceweek and gardner oncemonth
IAmA,not_removed,nothing planned right now but it would be fun to do again
IAmA,not_removed,well i think so many of us thought trump couldnt win but then he did i did go to pa to campaign for hillary but i guess i could have done even more if i knew where it was headed i stay positive because i believe in this country and i know that things will swing back at some point to rationality
IAmA,not_removed,its really close the last time we brought up our similar amendment we lost by votes now there are new members and i think more of them support getting the federal government out of it than the retired ones i think the new reps in particular who havent voted on it yet are great ones to reach out to the outcome will be in their hands
IAmA,not_removed,i think its an interesting and responsible lifestyle but its also not for everyone i dont know if it is a scaleable part of significantly reducing our carbon emissions that being said i would support policies that make it easier for people to live off the grid if they want
IAmA,not_removed,i think the best effort would be to win an election for another pro net neutrality president and a pro net neutrality congress there are legislative efforts to create some compromise laws around net neutrality but we have to be very careful about those i think as long as providers know that net neutrality could be around the corner they will be discouraged from implementing complex tiering and pricing systems because of the uncertainty around them
IAmA,not_removed,i have no idea if trump will last it depends on what he actually did there is a lot of smoke we dont know if the russian connection goes all the way to him or just a suspiciously high number of people around him i do think that we will get to the bottom of it and if he committed an impeachable act he will be held accountable but it could take time all the calls and letters to reps have been helpful peaceful marches too but most importantly volunteer for good candidates and vote in if democrats take the house back its a different ball game entirely
IAmA,not_removed,i think that pharma has bigger fish to fry and generally has not been very engaged with a few exceptions in opposing legalization thats just my observations marijuana is a clear cut case for highly addictive narcotics like heroin i do think that there are times that the criminal justice system needs to be involved but abuse is first and foremost a health issue physical through addiction and also mental health
IAmA,not_removed,well repealing the broadband privacy rule is the wrong direction also there are a lot of trojan horses in cybersecurity bills that could also impact privacy i constantly watch and monitor those and work with ds and rs to defend privacy i think a lot of reps dont understand the importance of privacy laws to the internet ecosystem and the jobs it creates as well as the services provided for all of us
IAmA,not_removed,well somehow of the country thinks trump is doing a great job and is not only right but is a terrific president so i dont think special interests have bought off all those people somehow they rationalize it in their minds
IAmA,not_removed,you would have to ask them i think maybe they dont understand it i have heard them call it a government takeover of the internet
IAmA,not_removed,there are a ton of uses that are being looked at one of the reasons i formed the blockchain caucus is to explore these opportunities obviously for land titling medical records personal records and to enhance cyber security for geospatial data the gov has a lot of big data stuff that would benefit from blockchain we also have to make sure to do no harm to private sector deployment
IAmA,not_removed,i think it would have a pretty good chance of passing if it got on the ballot as an initiative thats how it passed in ca
IAmA,not_removed,q how do you feel about the increasing polarization or partisanship if you will between the two parties its representatives and its constituents do you think its healthy for our democracy for the two major parties to increasingly vote down the party lines regardless of what they or the people of the nation believewant i think that the parties and the elected officials reflect the polarization of american society people get their news from different sources almost have different facts its scary q how do you view the current political climate when it comes to lobbying by large corporations do you view a large imbalance in influence when it comes to what corporations want vs what the public wants if you do see it as an issue do you have any ideas on where to begin fixing it i think campaign finance reform would help this a lot including public matching funds for small donations and getting rid of pacs the arm of companies that can actually give to candidates and overturning citizens united
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know sometimes it seems like people are deliberately being stupid i mean we all want the pipes to have a decent return on investment for the companies who connect us but they dont get to own the internet not unless youve done software dev work for me
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for sharing your story its a great example of what are laws have mean for people thanks for your work with veterans and yes i will also support additional visas for those who helped us in iraq and afghanistan and happy to meet with some pm me
IAmA,not_removed,if people have ethical concerns or environmental concerns about gmos its reasonably that they have the information to make informed decisions we cant agree on everything but am always happy to look at new information i think that labelling gmos will increase awareness of crop science and create new markets i generally think we should err on the side of providing more information not less
IAmA,not_removed,well every democrat just voted the other way on that so if it was a bribe it didnt work
IAmA,not_removed,nope
IAmA,not_removed,well i think you are reading something i misspoke at a couple years ago i support a campus process to ensure a safe campus environment while ideally there would be a criminal prosecution that isnt always the case for a number of reasons
IAmA,not_removed,thats a good question the main difference is that the consumer receives the zerorated services for free so if something wants to provide something that isnt the internet like access to a proprietary network for free and charge for internet access i think thats probably ok what do you think i try to think of the various useabuse cases but would love more input on this i dont want to discourage free services
IAmA,not_removed,mostly just laws and political change colorado showed that it can be done nothing is perfect but our regulations are much better than prohibition
IAmA,not_removed,i doubt it i have a year old and year old and want them to have a somewhat normal childhood
IAmA,not_removed,um
IAmA,not_removed,did a research paper in college on industrial hemp dont remember the racism part but the rest is definitely true
IAmA,not_removed,yeah of course i remember you daven i think or something like that jorian is doing great too jordanna lives in boulder and jorian in nyc anyway yeah we need to fully fund special ed part of special ed funding is federal and since its a federal mandate the federal government should pay more i will be dropping a bill to fully fund special ed and it probably wont pass but the good news is that this area is also likely to be immune from the cuts that are going around in other areas it is important to understand that the marijuana tax money does not go to the operational budget of schools only repair and construction in our state ultimately it will take a ballot initiative to fund education more i was involved with the last one that passed amendment in but would love to work on a longer term solution to funding education is our most important investment in the future
IAmA,not_removed,the precedent is prohibition alcohol there was a federal ban in our constitution it was repealed now alcohol regulations are in the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms which we would add marijuana too and it would be the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and marijuana
IAmA,not_removed,there are times in winter that i think of it
IAmA,not_removed,yes i spoke on this a lot on the house floor two days ago extensively on this and my oped also creamy peanut butter better crunchy is only partially made into butter its like half peanut butter half peanut
IAmA,not_removed,no there is and should be a safe harbor for media newspapers books etc the restriction has to do with the the right of corporations to buy political ads directly for or against candidates read what the opposite counsel said hopefully they refuted that
IAmA,not_removed,the best chance on these reform ideas is usually at the state ballot box through the initiative system for the states that have it
IAmA,not_removed,glad to hear that my hard work has earned your trust and respect there werent a lot of policy differences between me and joan in that race but campaign finance reform was definitely one of them i dont think i claimed to waltz into anything running for congress was definitely one of the two or three hardest things ive done in my life you remember that campaign a year and a half of going door to door calling people and i think we had or so joint appearancesdebates and yes i do believe there is a better way than pacs superpacs and self finance and thats why i am proud to sponsor the government by the people act httpssarbaneshousegovbythepeople would it fix it no but it would be a vastly better campaign finance system and the special interests would have less power
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think that marijuana directly led to residential real estate price increases but in general our economy is doing better and yes its becoming hard to live most places like boulder and fort collins in my district but also denver people have to move farther out to afford to live there is no easy answer but i know our state legislature is considering some measures and local governments also have to make zoning and density decisions
IAmA,not_removed,yeah there is marijuana use whether it is legal or illegal by making it legal we take the money away from cartels and drug dealers and give it to legitimate people who are heavily regulated its safer and the taxes help other public projects driving impairment is important to have laws on the books heres an article about some of my work in that area
IAmA,not_removed,i think if ed runs there are a lot of great dems in his district who would step up no early favorite not evading or anything its just way too early to say i think is the time to finally win the hopefully well have a strong candidate up and going soon
IAmA,not_removed,great to hear from you did you work with gina at our office in mapleton or our boulder office i am sorry you werent able to finish it hopefully we got to meet young people need to get involved and vote i hope that watching trump is helping people of all ages and young people realize whats at stake some people avoid voting and say there arent any differences well there are huge differences and were seeing that now
IAmA,not_removed,could that be an insurance issue as well and not strictly a legal concern
IAmA,not_removed,hasnt happened yet that im aware of but based on his remarks we are worried about it could happen any time
IAmA,not_removed,jeff sessions is one of the main reasons that we need this bill so urgently we are worried about some sort of crackdown on legal businesses or consumers that he might be cooking up there is significant bipartisan support for this bill its hard to get it to a vote but if it were on the floor tomorrow it would be very close indeed and might even have enough votes to pass in the mean time we can force ifwhen the cjs appropriations bill comes to the floor a vote on something called the mcclintockpolis amendment which would defund enforcement of marijuana laws in states where it is legal and im confident we have the votes to pass that sorry that all sounds kinda arcane and wonky but let me know if i need to explain any more
IAmA,not_removed,i will encourage others to not be scared of reddit
IAmA,not_removed,who is yours
IAmA,not_removed,we simply dont yet know how much we have to fear theoretically the ag could have some kind of mass enforcement action and round up people who own or work in dispensaries in co and even go after consumers i think if he does bad things it will likely be more subtle but i am worried and thats why im working hard on this bill it becomes more urgent if there is some kind of action he takes our legislators can pass a law like this but trump is president and would need to sign it unless we have and thanks for the compliment on my clothes lol
IAmA,not_removed,alcohol causes many more deaths than marijuana we should have alcohol addiction treatment available and marijuana addiction treatment too
IAmA,not_removed,well maybe they have a different vision for our country i sometimes ask myself the same question some are scared about not being renominated or elected by their party but its a better question to ask of them than me there are only a two or three who are really nuts the rest seem pretty normal
IAmA,not_removed,ive never been blackmailed or threatened
IAmA,not_removed,i am surprised that you got a felony for simple possession of a few painkillers sounds harsh if you were prosecuted under state law a governor can grant clemency i dont think a mass one is likely but if youve been clean since with the law you can certainly apply for it with your governors office i honestly dont think you have zero future in politics or government just be up front about your experience and talk about what you learned from it it could make a compelling narrative if you run for office about how you want to reform drug laws
IAmA,not_removed,that is so so needed i was in a green room recently with bill nye and i realize how much i admire his outreach efforts he went on a foxnews show and they were just brutal to him and i realized why most scientists dont want to subject themselves to that crap and yes for any science that is publicly funded the studies should be made freely available
IAmA,not_removed,great questions given who the president is and the actions he is already taken and the composition of congress we should focus on moving forward at the state and local level ca which if it was a country would be the largest economy in the world is moving forward on their own and so should we and yes we should work together with other states like ca but also internationally cas cap and trade system is international with canada i dont think we can work through the un as you have to be a country to be a member i will look into it but states can enter agreements with other countries thankfully co has a fully inclusive nondiscrimination law however lgbt americans have very few legal protections in the areas of the country that we need them the most and face the most discrimination we have a few republicans who support our equality act and we should keep the pressure up on them to join but i dont see a scenario that the republicans would let us vote on the equality act last year they shut down the spending bills over nondiscrimination because a majority of members wanted it but leadership didnt so while progress can be made at state and local level we will need to change congress to move forward
IAmA,not_removed,as someone who is both proguns and promarijuana thank you for bringing this to my attention somehow it flew under my radar
IAmA,not_removed,asking the important questions
IAmA,not_removed,boulder and fort collins are great i think renewable energy tech is critical to save the world
IAmA,not_removed,so far the states that have votes by the people initiatives are the ones that have moved forward politicians elected state legislators dont seem to want to do it so states have no initiativereferendum process and none of them that i know of have legalized marijuana
IAmA,not_removed,to be clear there are still people prosecuted and jailed for marijuana crimes in co if you are caught smuggling or illegally growing or selling marijuana we are very serious about enforcing our laws and sending people to prison mostly our state treated possession of a small amount or even dealing a small amount as a small crime so i would be shocked if anyone is still in jail for that after so many years there may still be people in jail for large scale smuggling or dealing activities that are still illegal under current law im not sure a law can fix this i think a governor carefully reviewing old cases and granting pardons if appropriate might be the best way
IAmA,not_removed,yes the role of money in politics is part of the problem not the entire problem because ideological divisions are also real but we need real campaign finance reform to reduce the influence of special interests states can lead the way particularly with initiatives that dont need to go through politicians
IAmA,not_removed,we have worked with cycling groups to establish special use areas for biking when we have public lands that are a good fit for cycling we work with the cycling community on those designations
IAmA,not_removed,yeah probably voting them in
IAmA,not_removed,thats completely different for search which is just one of many activities that people do on the internet competition is just a click away if you dont want google having your data use bing or aol or whatever other search engine you want with broadband i have comcast they are the only provider in my area i dont know how i would even have high speed access in my home and i would pretty much need to accept whatever lack thereof of a privacy policy they force on me
IAmA,not_removed,does google actually sell user data though i would think theyd want to keep all user data to themselves since theyre the ones doing the advertising and thus benefit from it theres definitely privacy concerns with google but i didnt think that selling user data was one of them
IAmA,not_removed,you have mass no light speed for you
IAmA,not_removed,seems like a nice guy his office is near mine
IAmA,not_removed,at the end of the day i would follow my conscience but then again most issues are not a matter of conscience but yeah i would be happy to do what was right and then just not get reelected and do another job
IAmA,not_removed,i have been active in this issue for years and it is one of the hardest battles ive fought there is currently a fight down at our state leg to at least move it a little further from schools ive also been very active in supporting the rights of our local governments fort collins broomfield boulder county to establish their own zoning and regulations of fracking
IAmA,not_removed,call or stop by the boulder county democratic office they would love to hear from you httpwwwbocodemsorg
IAmA,not_removed,i like justin amash thomas massie walt jones mark sanford among others
IAmA,not_removed,this one is my main one
IAmA,not_removed,well if you didnt have net neutrality there would probably be more of an incentive to deliver broadband to every home because the broadband providers would make more money and maybe it would make broadband cheaper if they didnt take all the extra revenues for their profits
IAmA,not_removed,i did do some initial market research but nothing fancy in the case of proflowers i knew there was a market there for flowers if we could delivery more efficiently and fresher and just looked up size of market online bluemountaincom far exceeded our hopes and projections in use and ais well i dont think i did much research but our thought was that people would want dialup accounts which is what we started off doing in chicago like indra in boulder
IAmA,not_removed,a group was in to meet with me about this recently yes this issue is largely bipartisan as are many issues i would love any thoughtful input and ideas on how to improve the system
IAmA,not_removed,oh god my representative is in charge of appropriations im sorry everyone
IAmA,not_removed,those three are well known powerful committee positions though are there any subcommittees or working groups where people have surprising amounts of power
IAmA,not_removed,i like the honesty here dunno its good to not get a line of bs that some of us just want to hear
IAmA,not_removed,gotta quibble with your last sentence there the repeal of alcohol prohibition set up a system wherein manufacturers could not also directly own retail outlets more or less in co your alcohol sales laws are different than in my state so im not exactly sure how it would shake out given a state by state basis but the original question seems to imply producers too your reply mentions the existence of large and small retail outlets but that is not really the question at hand id urge you to look into the trend of consolidation in beer distributors over the last years and how the craft beer movement has played out in your state and others there are a lot of lessons to be gleaned about how the end of cannabis prohibition might play out i think ops question isnt about where retail jobs might land of course there will be all sorts of business sizes to fit local markets but more about how wealthy interests like big tobacco ab inbev etc might be able to swoop into a fledgling industry and quickly squash the independent producers that made this market possible in the first place i dont think it takes an economist to understand that in terms of creating quality jobs it is more beneficial to have a lot of smallmedium sized players than a few well oiled corporate entities that leverage their existing infrastructure and lobbying power to achieve market hegemony
IAmA,not_removed,im not from the usa but i like any polly that is confortable starting a sentence with dunno is stead of bullshitting like they do
IAmA,not_removed,also didnt early local adopters get some kind of limited privilege on distribution licenses to give them a head start to give us a few years until the phillip morris of the world come to co and push the little guy around i wish i remember the details
IAmA,not_removed,you need only look at the craft beer industry to see the exact same thing playing out
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt think i fit into the suit and tie environment and maybe i dont but as i grew and matured ive now found myself in a corporate chef environment its different for sure but i put on my uniform with a similar eye for detail as a tailored suit it takes creativity and restraint at times but every industry needs talent i think the two industries will have that in common having tattooed weirdos at the top not being uncommon
IAmA,not_removed,nearly every industry is like that you have people that go into it for the love of it and some who see it as a gap in the market
IAmA,not_removed,yeah but look at how the big brewers have consolidated down they are also famous for making craft beer that is actually bottled in the same factor as the peasant beer
IAmA,not_removed,idk i buy craft beer because it tastes good i dont give a shit about their story i think you might be exaggerating
IAmA,not_removed,growing really good weed is not easy
IAmA,not_removed,yeah weekends are fine but during the week you might get towed you probably saw me walk my dog sometimes too
IAmA,not_removed,completely agree im proud to have voted for polis and he seems to truly have peoples best interests at heart
IAmA,not_removed,welcome back to co say hi if you see me around our state is going well not that we dont have our challenges but its a great time to be in co
IAmA,not_removed,no the toga ones are the senators roman senators
IAmA,not_removed,oh man this is the first time anyones actually responded to me in an ama im feeling starstruck in all seriousness thank you i know your job is way harder than people think it is and you must get a lot of hate from all sides not just from your policies but also just congress is evil and they wanna sell us to corporations i could never do what you do without letting that get to me and i frankly admire anyone who can handle that without shutting down and becoming cynical
IAmA,not_removed,but dont you know that amas are for answering popular questions to make yourself look good youre doing reddit all wrong in seriousness thank you very much for coming here being honest and answering even the hard questions
IAmA,not_removed,rep polis could you do me and my neighbors a solid and infect your esteemed colleague rep reichert from wa with this responding to constituents thing youve caught wed appreciate it mightily
IAmA,not_removed,dunno if youll read this but just here to say that its refreshing seeing a down to earth politician here thanks for doing what you do and representing your constituents well greetings from australia
IAmA,not_removed,follow ups i take that as a no to join as a cosponsor i feel that line of first defending obamacare which is fantastic but flawed comes from the leadership as its a line commonly hit by all congressional ds why not take the lead on this of dems support it of public do so what if it cant be passed this is what the people support and in my eyes can help to repair the party image and give the grassroots energy a win which are few and far between especially to those of us on the left of the party to truly resist trump regarding unpopular parties do you believe that the image that neither party truly represents the people plays into that unpopularity senator sanders was able to speak to the individual and that is why his campaign flourished he stood for all of us not corporationsbig money interests how can we combat the popularity issue in your eyes ie ensure dems turn out also a new question do you consider yourself progressive liberal is there a difference to you
IAmA,not_removed,when i look at the democratic party being so unpopular you have to also consider that the republican party is just as unpopular be very cautious approaching this type of question this way to many progressives it can come off as yet another misdirection or dodge well look at trump which was used on us exhaustively over the last months unifying is possible but this sore spot absolutely needs to be addressed the up and coming voting population will richly reward honesty and abruptness regarding real issues we believe in and are very good at spotting weasel words or nonmessages
IAmA,not_removed,i really appreciate the distinction between the democratic party or republican party being unpopular and the unpopularity of parties in general thank you
IAmA,not_removed,whats your ign and how long have you been playing
IAmA,not_removed,hes the coolest
IAmA,not_removed,he also wears positively dreamy purple velvet sport coats
IAmA,not_removed,dad confirmed
IAmA,not_removed,so what are you driving
IAmA,not_removed,dad
IAmA,not_removed,a future election gives us a more privacyminded congress thats my hope im about to turn and have only voted in federal elections and have never really actively looked into my candidates ive simply voted republican up until november when i voted for johnson and a couple of other libertarian candidates on the ballot i recently discovered the new democrat caucus and it seems to be much more aligned with where i find myself politically these days its so frustrating to me that privacy of all things is such a partisan issue
IAmA,not_removed,what is the future of womens health laws every time a republican is president planned parenthood goes under how is this to proceed in this new political climate and for future administrations
IAmA,not_removed,that means its time to vote people
IAmA,not_removed,i also spoke with your office regarding kratom before that bill was up your office is fantastic and i connor thank you enough for the hard work you did to prevent the insane dea classification i know more than a few people whos lives have been saved by kratom and your work certainly saved countless more youre a legend
IAmA,not_removed,theres a written by georgi boorman at the federalist i think she has been able to reveal why all of a sudden this ancient plant is under attack by a small group of individuals and organizations hint all of them connected to big pharma
IAmA,not_removed,thats a really clever stance you took it must be frustrating having a rep from a state like louisiana with their obesity epidemic trying to tell us how to lead a healthy lifestyle in colorado well done
IAmA,not_removed,did you actually
IAmA,not_removed,overdosing on marijuana and deaths related to marijuana lol
IAmA,not_removed,my wife was ecstatic to hear about our new honorary rep thanks
IAmA,not_removed,well you can consider me your honorary rep i will do the same my rep sucks
IAmA,not_removed,colorados districts seem to be clearly structured to favor republicans despite being so even between the two sides in the overall attitude httpspublictableaucomprofilegabedewittvizhomeknowyourstaterepresentativesknowyourrep
IAmA,not_removed,hell yes we do not only is it better faster and cheaper than the comcastcenturylink duopoly but after the privacy rollback its even more awesome
IAmA,not_removed,i live in nc and we have a whole infrastructure just waiting to be used for cannabis since the drastic downturn in tobacco production in the past years lots of rural areas in nc are hurting bad this could be a huge boon for them if we could only get people to see it and let go of old prejudices
IAmA,not_removed,what do other reps have to say when these points are brought up
IAmA,not_removed,follow up what can a concerned citizen do to influence the public debate about climate change i dont want to hear dont eat meat or bike to work we need big national scale change to save human civilization
IAmA,not_removed,republican here i agree its an intriguing idea i dont see how that would work but the way automation is going it may eventually be needed then again everyone talks about the trends being towards a servicebased economy which would curb some of the need for a universal basic income from these market factors
IAmA,not_removed,as i understand current co law there is a nanogram limit on the amount of thc in a persons blood after which they are considered violating the law i believe in science legislators literally pulled this nanogram limit out of the air i am not aware of any scale of inebriation for marijuana that is similar to alcohol where drinks in a hour may cause a woman to blow over there is no equivalent linear measure for marijuana taking hits off a joint may affect one woman different than another and one or both may or may not be unsafe to drive current legislation seems to be operating by legislators personal beliefs as opposed to actual scientific evaluation how do we make sure that science has a larger role going forward in determining marijuana intoxication especially in light of the current presidents ignorance of facts and trust in science
IAmA,not_removed,do you support the efforts of httpfairvoteorg towards ranked choice voting and multimember districts also do you support the httpscitizensclimatelobbyorg carbon tax and dividend plan
IAmA,not_removed,a local school district of mine recently applied for the best grant those funds definitely go to a good use and since everyone is complaining about their reps doug lamborn
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know how to respond what are you either case i respect your decision and will not hold it against you thank you for what i think is an honest answer
IAmA,not_removed,this is one of the most politicianlike nonanswers to a question ive ever seen and i love it haha
IAmA,not_removed,theres a lot you can tell about a person by the kind of sandwiches they eat representative polis has given me a lot to think about he either doesnt want to offend the ethnic sandwich caucus or he really is trying to avoid carbs and i guess be healthy
IAmA,not_removed,ive asked it in an ama i think its a lighthearted humanizing question and you never know when you might have a favorite sandwich or other food in common with a public figure of some sort
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for answering i know these are becoming bigger topics over time so its nice to see a represintives perspective on them
IAmA,not_removed,this is the way the uk and canada both do it independent electoral commissions you can never stop political meddling but it goes a long way to making electoral boundaries a nonpartisan issue
IAmA,not_removed,i might be a bit too late but do you think that there is an advantage to a carbon tax over cap and trade or vice versa it seems that looking at british columbias carbon tax that it would be more effective than the seemingly weaker eu cap and trade but im not a policy expert so thats just my highly uneducated opinion
IAmA,not_removed,sorry typo on my phone
IAmA,not_removed,sure but what kind of sandwich would you serve
IAmA,not_removed,whats the tone of those interactions is it generally focused on getting particular things done for co or are there ever broader policy discussions at play
IAmA,not_removed,im sure your sponsorship of this bill would get you a slot on real time with maher
IAmA,not_removed,i know that things will swing back at some point to rationality dear god i hope so
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for the response however what can we do now to help protect net neutrality i have donated to various groups like free press and the electronic frontier foundation and i would love to see people mobilize against efforts to repeal it the news may have only come out tonight but i care deeply about net neutrality at the same time though i dont want to have to check the news about it every single day yet i use the internet a lot so it keeps worrying me constantly checking the news like that is detrimental to me so im not sure what i should do
IAmA,not_removed,do you think that all of the confidence on the democrats side with trumps massive losses so far will create overconfidence in the senate races basically are democrats deluding themselves like in same question regarding the redistricting also
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your response i agree with you about the lack of understanding and hope the right experts and voices from the large online based companies are included and listened to in future decisions
IAmA,not_removed,fair enough i just wonder who had the thought to say this seems like a great idea
IAmA,not_removed,thank you again
IAmA,not_removed,this question comes from an australian but with american patents and i know this so i dont mind if you dont have time to answer anyway here we traditionally have had two parties but increasingly have more representation of minor parties in the legislature do you feel that two parties can adequately represent all three hundred million plus americans additionally i feel that the current two party system in the us has arisen due to the way your electoral system is structured particularly the use of first past the post voting do you think thats the case and do you think any change is needed in the electoral system
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt gerrymandering also play a huge role in the polarization of congress specifically though
IAmA,not_removed,lol thanks for the response ok i wont put you down keep up the good fight hope i get to live in boulder for a long time and have you as my rep for years to come edit i see we have serial downvoters great silence people talking to their own representative that makes sense
IAmA,not_removed,oh my god you actually responded and now i feel like an idiot so heres an actual question what tips would you give someone looking to go into state level or national level politics
IAmA,not_removed,this is the first time ive seen someone especially a politician take a direct question on a sensitive topic like that on an ama
IAmA,not_removed,i believe isps should be common carriers both to consumers and content providers is there a way to reconcile that with zero rating and thank you from loveland you do a great job representing me an independent ill be truly sorry if we get cut out of the in
IAmA,not_removed,please run for gardners seat in we will help babysit your kids
IAmA,not_removed,thats a actually a pretty good reason not to do so thanks for answering do you have any idea on who is currently planning on running for the party in or anybody who you would personally support if they ran
IAmA,not_removed,he does have a point on the racism thing with marijuana as it was tied to a dislike of hispanic people same thing was true of early gun control laws but even if the origin is racist there is some merit to regulating or at least debating the regulation ofmarijuana and gunsand i say that as a very pro gun and prolegalization person
IAmA,not_removed,for clarification his argument is based on which has received good reviews
IAmA,not_removed,dupont and hearst if im not mistaken industrial hemp was going to give what we know as paper a run for its money hearst owning a vast empire of newspapers and achieving vertical integration in the paper production industry used his influence to bolster the reefer madness stereotype
IAmA,not_removed,also did a research paper they hated mexicans mexicans smoked weed while white people drank was pretty easy
IAmA,not_removed,google william randolf hearst propaganda campaign
IAmA,not_removed,i regret leaving every day dont do it serious question though if you have time people weve left behind in fort collins say parts of old town are turning into a dump with less than savory characters brought in by the legalization of marijuana the few times ive been back i tend to agree would you agree how are you planning to combat it if so short of convincing every state to treat marijuana like alcohol
IAmA,not_removed,fort collins resident here what do you think of the condo defects bill all the developers are trying to push through to limit their liability to class action suits they claim its making it too expensive to build lowercost housing but im calling bs it seems like theyre just trying to pad their bottom line also nisp glade what do you think should be done there how do we make the explosive growth pay for the necessary infrastructure upgrades when so many levers of power are controlled by developer interests
IAmA,not_removed,i worked in mapleton with gina and jorge wonderful people we met once briefly and you were so kind and personable i do hope this last election increases the voter turnout in dramatically also heres to hoping trump and his picks dont cause too much damage in the coming years thanks for all your hard work combatting bigoted and xenophobic politics mr polis
IAmA,not_removed,exactly what id expect someone who was being blackmailed to say blink twice if you need us to send someone to help
IAmA,not_removed,you know i thought it was a little harsh too apparently and i didnt know this but there are some small town cops who patrol the interstate and who have such amazing vision that despite driving in the opposite direction of my car with a grassy median and spillway separating the two they are able to spot one not both broken license plate lights on my car seems impossible i know but thats what the cop said so it must be true then he used that infraction as grounds to spend an hour turning my car inside out looking for something oddly i was never cited for the broken license plate light it was a lot of fun trying to get someone i know to answer a random county jail phone call to bail me out thanks for the positive advice about the future it had crossed my mind to make that narrativeand if i put it out up front then at least i couldnt be blackmailed or be seen to be a liar too it just is really painful to have this scarlet f and for something utterly victimless i hope with all this frenzy about the opioid epidemic it doesnt get lost that there are those who need the medicine for legit reasons
IAmA,not_removed,foco fosho
IAmA,not_removed,can confirm have lived in boulder currently in fort collins both are amazing cities
IAmA,not_removed,from denver
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your response and hard work
IAmA,not_removed,sorry maybe i phrased that badly what i meant was how can we find and then support candidates we believe in
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared i wanted to jump in here ive admittedly not been a fan of yours dating back to the august primary i felt that joan in particular was treated unfairly and her years of dedication hard work were denigrated by becker your team i will also admit to being begrudgingly won over by your years of hard work since that election by your own dedication to being a legislator by all accounts youve proven to be a model of what we want in a representative but lets be real here you didnt just waltz into your seat the facts of as follows in you spent nearly million to win a seat on the state board of education defeating your closest rival alexander who spent about on the election the denver post the millionaires club why leave ballot initiatives to the rich august in the democratic primary election in colorados congressional district when you ran against former state senator joan fitzgerald and environmental activist will shafroth you spent million of your own money with your total spending for the primary reaching over million federal elections commission friends of jared polis committee quarter filing october fecgov daily camera polis wins dem nod august you set a colorado record with the most selffunding in state history during the election with your million in selffunding still standing as a state record denver post joe coors has spent million of own money on campaign october you mention campaign finance reform including getting rid of pacs but those same pacs represent workers as well as corporate interests how would this not just empower the wealthy to fund their own campaigns and put everyone else at a disadvantage you mention matching funds but arizonas matching funds have been struck down by the supreme court assuming though that would be overturned along with citizens united matching funds with caps essentially equal asking candidates to fight with a hand tied behind their back with no cap no one will want to do it
IAmA,not_removed,piggybacking on this how do you feel about the calls to buy congressional browsing history from the isps and make it public
IAmA,not_removed,selling it to themselves no reason to sell it to advertisers when youre the biggest one
IAmA,not_removed,what if my ship were to be covered with some sciencey term like antimatter would this make me invisible to gods wacky rules
IAmA,not_removed,well let him know i look forward to voting against him as i have since he was first elected
IAmA,not_removed,good representation isnt a career do good then leave when youre not
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the reply you have my vote my parents my wife my inlaws etc and anyone else i can convince or twist their arms should be easy soon best regards
IAmA,not_removed,all the libertarians basically then what about rand paul
IAmA,not_removed,oh god my rep is in charge of tax issues im also sorry everyone
IAmA,not_removed,they arent well known to most people i bet most redditors havent heard their names maybe something will come out of the nolabels problem solvers working group with freshman nj rep josh gottheimer dnj and tom reed rny as cochairs
IAmA,not_removed,certainly not wellknown to me
IAmA,not_removed,that was my immediate thought at well dunno markets are markets is the best answer ive heard from a politician in quite some time most would have given some bullshit circular answer and be taking about their upcoming book by the end of the post lol
IAmA,not_removed,yes what i mean is that it will play out at the state level and states will have different laws some will prohibit vertical integration grower and dispensary others might require it some wont give more than a certain number of permits to a particular company in some states like pa the state actually runs the alcohol stores weird but true so the interaction of markets and local regs will determine the outcome but i think its likely a few larger players will emerge
IAmA,not_removed,good point and those microbreweries are being scooped up by the big boys because they threaten of their profit
IAmA,not_removed,and potency im not trying to dab bud lights pass me the torch and the imperial porter
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i dont buy craft for its unique characteristics as much as the delicious flavor
IAmA,not_removed,he is i dont give a fuck where a beer comes from if i like it they can stroke themselves all they want if they say these seeds have been in a time capsule since the ill care just as little give me a taste
IAmA,not_removed,well we need the obligatory picture of your dog now
IAmA,not_removed,time for a new account username no longer valid
IAmA,not_removed,well there are a lot of issues we want to lead on yes healthcare is one how about immigration reform how about a carbon tax or cap and trade i can think of so many things the danger isnt so much in this one bill as in if we focus on all these things that we cant pass with the current congress we are taking our eye off the ball in stopping the bad stuff yeah i think that senator sanders has a lot of personal popularity but that doesnt make the democrats any more popular same with republicans there are many people who love trump but dislike the republicans i think people see them as topdown and run by elites and not responsive to the people i think we can combat the lack of popularity by showing people the huge difference like all the horrible stuff republicans are passing daily democrats wouldnt do that we can certainly talk about our ideas for the country too and how they differ i dont know what i call myself obviously others call me all sorts of things including letter words liberal to be is an oldersounding term and it also has another meaning in classic liberal than todays liberal progressive also has one meaning from the early century and a related but also different meaning now i love progress and moving forward and am very future oriented so i guess i would pick progressive over liberal
IAmA,not_removed,the up and coming voting population will richly reward honesty and abruptness regarding real issues we believe in and are very good at spotting weasel words or nonmessages im less optimistic given the state of education in this country
IAmA,not_removed,given how this last election went i couldnt disagree more with your last paragraph far too many people are undereducated and are turned off by facts and honesty and more attuned to easy to digest sounds bites regardless of truth carl rove said it best the gop and its voting base does not operate or care about facts anymore feelings are more important to them
IAmA,not_removed,this is also known as fighting a malignant political party whose disastrous policies will be the ruin of many with nothing absolutely nothing no program at all just were not that bad
IAmA,not_removed,or he answered he drives himself good advice
IAmA,not_removed,this guy just won my vote and i dont even live in his state actual humor in our politicians is so rare we need more al frankens
IAmA,not_removed,a yellow submarine
IAmA,not_removed,yeah both parties are very large coalitions and privacy is one of those issues that has some very good ds and some very good rs working together so its important to dig deeper than party libertarians are really good better than ds and rs on the government side of privacy preventing gov from having your private info but not as good at protecting against privacy from big corporations theoretically the market should take care of privacy but the problem is that in something like broadband most consumers dont really have a choice
IAmA,not_removed,being an informed voter is a good thing id encourage you to look at what you like and dislike about different candidates actually make lists it can be very helpful especially at the local level and in primaries i typically vote for democrats but i always look at what issues i agree and disagree with each of the candidates on so i can vote for the candidate that represents me best
IAmA,not_removed,ive simply voted republican im glad you are starting to look at who and what youre voting for lots of people out there are republican or democrat simply because thats what mom or dad was i dont care what party you vote for just make that effort to be informed and vote for what you believe thats the point of voting
IAmA,not_removed,get rid of the gerrymandering first
IAmA,not_removed,hello connor
IAmA,not_removed,christ im from louisiana and almost all of our representatives and senators are complete turds were definitely doing our part to turn the country into a shit hole
IAmA,not_removed,woah man thats a pretty crazy coincidence
IAmA,not_removed,it will kill our children
IAmA,not_removed,follow up what can a concerned citizen do to influence the public debate about climate change depending on what you mean by public debate my suggestion would be to ignore it the one and only thing that matters is raising money and buying candidatesvotes theres between what voters want and what laws get passed
IAmA,not_removed,im pretty sure biking to work is national change cars being one of the biggest polluters d
IAmA,not_removed,we should organize in a decentralized way to cause the transition that we know needs to be done im in agreement with your sentiment look i made a comment about this in a small climate sub combine what i describe in that thread with a coordinated push to get people into office with policies like are being described in this thread into office at as many levels of government as possible
IAmA,not_removed,did you see a few months ago if machines produce everything we need the outcome will depend on how things are distributed everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machineproduced wealth is shared or most people can end up miserably poor if the machineowners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution so far the trend seems to be toward the second option with technology driving everincreasing inequality
IAmA,not_removed,my gf is part of a group of neuropsychologists looking to address this exact issue they presented their evidence based research program to a mixed group of legislators and police departments and the police in particular were offended that their assessment of impairment could be questioned by evidence and their project ended up not getting state funding there is a huge uphill battle against entrenched interests and its going to be tough but know that there are people trying to fight against random arbitrary limits and we should do the best we can to support them
IAmA,not_removed,fyi the nanogram rule was nullified by a jury in colorado
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair alcohol affects people differently too as a teetotaler partygoer i observed people getting drunk for a decade and the differences between reactions to alcohol are unbelievable the same amount which made a big guy to fell over made a tall but thin girl just happy that was a famous accident science should find out how fast thc other active ingredienst leave the system how long it alters the behaviour in average on the other hand i think its easier to deal with happy people waiting for the stop sign to turn green than with angry drunks speeding my cents
IAmA,not_removed,i cant complain about mine its ujaredpolis edit had the dumbs and forgot where i was
IAmA,not_removed,if you want a good sandwich in this representatives district i would recommend halffast subs
IAmA,not_removed,also snarfs everythings good but i always order the pro italian on wheat
IAmA,not_removed,what he answered it pretty clearly i thought i take his answer to mean he doesnt like sandwiches but does like both filling and bread separately
IAmA,not_removed,at this point i think a carbon tax is easier to explain to pass and probably a more straightforward policy
IAmA,not_removed,and i thought it was my high heels
IAmA,not_removed,right now im thinking
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldnt hesitate to call either one if there is a senate vote coming up i think they should pay attention to or a bill that i want to do with them i would say our discussions are colorado issues and general issues i called gardner last week on an education issue for instance
IAmA,not_removed,trump was unpopular when he won the election and yet he still won so we should take nothing for granted this could be a long haul
IAmA,not_removed,its hard to be overconfident when one looks at how horrible the map is i dont have my source for the following available off the top of my head unfortunately but if the numbers repeated themselves exactly same voters turning out and voting for the same party republicans would end up with a seat majority in the senate same scenario except a uniform five point swing favoring democrats would still result in republicans picking up a few seats
IAmA,not_removed,yes with our current electoral system it is very hard for minor parties to get elected if we had a parliamentary system then there would be several minor parties greens libertarians at least with seats
IAmA,not_removed,gerrymandering has no effect on the senate yet the senate is just as polarized gerrymandering simply gives a bigger voice to certain voters in many areas the fact that the house is limited to members does this as well
IAmA,not_removed,just get involved there are surprisingly few barriers just start showing up and before you know it youll be an insider
IAmA,not_removed,loveland is a great city ill be there for a town hall in two weeks thanks for your input on isps i think with zero rating what is being offered should not be construed as the internet if groups want to set up free wifi for their own propriety services i think thats fine i dont see the harm
IAmA,not_removed,its too early but i will work behind the scenes to make sure we have a strong candidate and hope to back someone really good and who can win and beat trump
IAmA,not_removed,i think the um was shorthand for hey look at exactly what im trying to do not i have no idea what youre talking about
IAmA,not_removed,well i would like to see some data on this i suspect that the general increase in opioid abuse might be more to blame but in this case if i was advising the city of fort collins maybe ill mention it to the mayor they just need to enforce their no smoking in public ordnance in old town to clean it up
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget about
IAmA,not_removed,touche
IAmA,not_removed,i think that voters value honesty and admire someone who has faced real life challenges and learned from them
IAmA,not_removed,foco foco foco foco foco foco
IAmA,not_removed,yes most people in this country are good people i agree with that
IAmA,not_removed,probably want to repost this to the parent thread
IAmA,not_removed,yeah thats my point
IAmA,not_removed,i like you
IAmA,not_removed,haha his policies and ideas dont overlap much with mine
IAmA,not_removed,youre so right im sure about the general awareness of the heads of the big committees i wasnt dont they do the talk shows at all but cant wait to check out nolabels
IAmA,not_removed,httpswwwnolabelsorgourpeople looks like they need to update their website neither josh gottheimer or tom reed are listed anywhere here lieberman and huntsman are the listed cochairs for anyone else curious httpsreedhousegovmediacenterpressreleasesgottheimerandreedelectedcochairsbipartisanproblemsolverscaucus
IAmA,not_removed,wait tracy jordan and jenna maroney aka the problem solvers are on the case
IAmA,not_removed,nolabels is on a lot of college campuses hoping it leads to electoral college and district drawing reform which rep polis i hope you support
IAmA,not_removed,its also the most accurate answer ive heard from a politician in a while most act like theyre prophets foretelling the path of the economy when in reality you cant see the future
IAmA,not_removed,agree agree agree wow youve made my day this is the first interaction ive had with a congressional representative that wasnt a prefilled letter so cool btw i have family in your district and i guarantee they probably voted for you shout out to the pedantic police i triggered with my guarantee probably wordplay hey guys in language you can subvert the expected context of your wording for comedic effect hey wowzers
IAmA,not_removed,im in utah and the state runs the liquor stores here too if you want a bottle of booze you better get it before because thats when they close and thats just the tip of the iceberg of how restricting this state is when it comes to alcohol its mind numbing so there is about chance of anything marijuana related being passed here because as everyone knows marijuana is way more dangerous than alcohol
IAmA,not_removed,in canada there is now a billion dollar corporation canopy growth corp and corporations that are licensed producers and are able to produce and sell marijuana some even go so far as to export medically to other countries in europe there are definitely going to be some large competitors whenever there is money it will be interesting to see how it all plays out
IAmA,not_removed,but by and large a lot of these places still produce exactly the same beer they had before what generally changes is that now other plants jation wide are now also producing the craft brew to be shipped else where supplydemand while i dont know if rogue brew co is bought out as well i know that each one i pick up has been a damn good beer thus far and ive seen it as far as texas
IAmA,not_removed,httpimgurcomapadre
IAmA,not_removed,ujaredpolis we seriously need a pic of you and your dog or just your dog
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for taking my questions
IAmA,not_removed,classic liberal than todays liberal im studying international relations and this is so true neoliberalism in ir is way different from econpol
IAmA,not_removed,this is a good thread thrashpantsand it kind of highlights the idea to me that even our more progressive representatives continue to drop the ball on whether they stand for a goddamn thing or not why not take the lead on this of dems support it of public do the answer well there are a lot of issues we want to lead on if we focus on all these things that we cant pass with the current congress we are taking our eye off the ball in stopping the bad stuff then lead take a stand plant a flag cosponsor the bill not to be too harsh on you rep polis i was in the cinder block union hall in when you and two other primary candidates pitched about of us and i did vote for you that primary but goddamn stand up for this yall gotta get behind a concrete program to make peoples lives better that means universal health care living wage college for all a green new deal shits not complicated it just takes people with courage who arent bought and have principles and news flash rep polis that doesnt rule you out i really do believe youre one of the good guys but ffs if you cant even cosponsor conyers bill what are you even there for so anyway i feel like representative polis could use an earful from jimmy dore or maybe his in depth part interview with thomas frank my question if i send a copy of the book listen liberal by thomas frank to your office will you read it
IAmA,not_removed,or that the population he speaks of even votes
IAmA,not_removed,he won my vote and im not even american
IAmA,not_removed,just wish he was running here in alabama
IAmA,not_removed,i heard we all live there
IAmA,not_removed,i really appreciate how candid this ama is and how thoughtful your responses have been im in ohio or youd have my vote cheers
IAmA,not_removed,rand paul mr libertarian cosponsored the bill but abstained what do you think of that i think its a joke by a career politician that is a huge part of the problem why havent people called him out on this
IAmA,not_removed,could you ever see internet being classified as a basic public utility are there any initiatives on the horizon to do so which we the people can support
IAmA,not_removed,is there any talk about colorado protecting privacy with a statewide policy like
IAmA,not_removed,privacy is one of those issues that has some very good ds and some very good rs working together where are the good rs working on this it was a partyline vote every single member of the gop edit in the senate voted to sell our online privacy by treating isps like websites even though theyre drastically different considering isp competition is so sparse already boulderites know what im talking about this seems a huge step in the wrong direction i dont see any good rs on this issue
IAmA,not_removed,yeah ive become way more aware of things in the last months now that im back in tn and plan to stay here for a while i want to be involved more rep diane black absolutely needs to go when shes up for reelection im torn about our senators sen bob corker strongly supports efforts to fight modern slavery which im behind but he and sen lamar alexander both bow down to partyovercountry rep jim cooper d is part of the new democrat caucus and blue dog democrats both are the more conservative factions within the democratic party theyre more liberal on social policy but not extremely liberal on them theyre seemingly more concerned with education not betsy devoss education infrastructure technologyscience and practical governance
IAmA,not_removed,hey a correct spelling of my name need something
IAmA,not_removed,they said as they take a drink of their year scotch
IAmA,not_removed,even bigger is the meat industry going vegetarian or vegan is an insane reduction on carbon footprint and the amount of water you consume
IAmA,not_removed,you know that a lot more people work in boulder than can afford to live there im afraid thats not a choice individuals can make in big enough numbers to matter edit thought you were jp maybe you dont know how expensive boulder is
IAmA,not_removed,are there any research papers concerning this you could link me to
IAmA,not_removed,a jury nullification doesnt mean it cant be enforced
IAmA,not_removed,snarfs instead
IAmA,not_removed,god now im going to have to go all the way to colorada to eat a sandwich in this congressmans district cause i was high and curious and you all gave me such great answers thanks reddit
IAmA,not_removed,obligatory pics or it didnt happen
IAmA,not_removed,something something south carolina
IAmA,not_removed,beautiful
IAmA,not_removed,rep polis are you vegan very exciting if so i thought booker was the only vegan in government currently speaking of animalrelated issues you were a cosponsor of last session rep hastings introduced the resolution again this session its now numbered but i see youve not yet signed on as a cosponsor is there a reason why not thank you for doing this ama
IAmA,not_removed,trump didnt even get of the total american population including kids and other people who cant vote that being said he had one of the biggest minorities in the country presuming hillary doesnt run again who are the democrats going to unify behind if only there was some charismatic person from somewhere like colorado
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for the tip just a fun question ive seen on this thread that you play lol do you play anything else sorry if this has already been asked
IAmA,not_removed,thanks again for your hard work and taking the time to do this ama it really means a lot to us i think that zero rating offers could be perfectly acceptable when taken with actual internet service being regulated as the essential utility it is until then zero rating is simply a ploy for the largest content and therefore largest advertising providers to place their carefully crafted content in front of consumers exclusively
IAmA,not_removed,take gardners seat in hes an asshole
IAmA,not_removed,i thought it was shorthand for you must be trolling me with that question
IAmA,not_removed,i like you all but you you i wink at
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair the alternative would require him to admit extensive knowledge of marijuana which would be politically awkward if he was well versed
IAmA,not_removed,say hi to them for me
IAmA,not_removed,i guarantee that there is a probability of everything
IAmA,not_removed,guarantee they probably voted for you what
IAmA,not_removed,as a pa native state run alcohol sucks whats worse here is that only recently last year or could you buy beer by the pack in grocery stores all beer sales had to be done by the case and was only available at specific distributors that only sold beer wanna grab a sixer and some chicken for dinner on a friday too fuckin bad you gotta drive and extra minutes out of the way and buy enough beer to host a small pong tournament
IAmA,not_removed,also from utah not all of them close at some open until wowow but i feel your pain relatively close internet individual utah will likely be the last to legalize the marijuanas on the upside flights to denver are bucks and heres to hoping wendover goes crazy with the opportunity
IAmA,not_removed,in washington we only had state ran liquor stores we voted to privatize alcohol then we legalized marijuana
IAmA,not_removed,an op that delivers are you sure youre a politician
IAmA,not_removed,am boulder resident can confirm this is in fact a dog keep up the good work jared
IAmA,not_removed,for geek cred
IAmA,not_removed,would pet your doggo
IAmA,not_removed,he delivers
IAmA,not_removed,i looked at your picture immediately reread the headline and went yep and nodded my head
IAmA,not_removed,well shit youve got my vote even more now
IAmA,not_removed,most wholesome politician ive ever seen on reddit
IAmA,not_removed,dog dog dog dog dog dog dog
IAmA,not_removed,the dog is a lie curse politicians and their imaginary pooches
IAmA,not_removed,or your dog and someone else but lets get serious this is mostly about your dog
IAmA,not_removed,see you in a week or two
IAmA,not_removed,because like he said theyre on defense and if the agenda of the house is moving along they have to too when youre the minority party you cant pick and you certainly cant dictate legislative agenda this bill wouldnt make it out of committee why not move on and say work and fight this tax reform tell me what good does it do to waste time and effort on a pointless gesture than to meet the republicans where they stand yeah having a concrete agenda to push for is really important and democrats need to rally around a message if this was or sure lets talk policy but now is the time for defense time to defend your flank call it defeatist but i like to call it how government works
IAmA,not_removed,he would definitely be running in alabama from a mob with pitchforks torches and a noose
IAmA,not_removed,truth be told i dont think id give up living here in boulder to live in alabama haha
IAmA,not_removed,yep in a reply north of here he said that there would be a mixture of big and small players if marijuana were regulated like alcohol kind of how theres a budweiser an anheuser busch and many small breweries jared didnt try to pander to the voters who would rather there were not giant corporations producing marijuana with consistent medium quality and for low prices with doublespeak or avoiding the question he was honest
IAmA,not_removed,rand paul has never claimed to be a libertarian he has said so before that above all else he is a republicanconservative with libertarianish leanings as a supporter of his my own personal issue with him is that he puts his feet in the water but never truly jumps in on anything id much prefer it if he supported the bill either or not being passionate on issues is why he never got past in a nomination that should have been his
IAmA,not_removed,friends having friends would be nice
IAmA,not_removed,getting people to go vegan or vegetarian is not really feasible on a large scale instead maybe focus on eat meat only after or cut meat out days a week youd get more buy in
IAmA,not_removed,along the same lines eat local shipping food from across the countryoceans is a big source of pollution buying from local farmssupporting restaurants that source locally dramatically reduces emissions
IAmA,not_removed,coincidentally i just watched food inc in school
IAmA,not_removed,thats the problem my gf and the group of neuropsychologists wereare trying to be the ones to write the paper on this but they are having a hard time getting funding against an openly hostile police force they are looking for funding in other areas though so hopefully it works out
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,my partner is vegan but im not strictly vegan ill make sure i get added right away to that bill
IAmA,not_removed,agreed so is his office staff
IAmA,not_removed,not really i dont think he one of the largest supporters of marijuanna in our government if hes a good politician he should be very well versed
IAmA,not_removed,im sorry im so late but i feel the need to support your cause as a new yorker what can i do to help mr polis and his direction
IAmA,not_removed,so youre saying that there is a chance that there might not be a probability of everything
IAmA,not_removed,as a pa resident i tried to upvote you i then realized i hadnt loggedin and id have to get up and go to the keyboard to do so htpc i took many unwelcome steps to the keyboard after soda and whiskeys to upvote youfor anyone unaware thats how shitty pa liquor laws are
IAmA,not_removed,yes if you need liquor beer and mixers its three different stores and an hour ordeal to go to the grocery store state store and beer distributor
IAmA,not_removed,luckily that has changed although it should be noted that you could also have bought six packs from some bars and restaurants now you can even but alcohol on sundays in some stores im glad pa has loosened up on the stupid blue laws
IAmA,not_removed,dont bring any weed home from denver bam felony its sickening how cops line up on the utah side of the colorado border profiling hippies and harassing them hoping for a bust kudos to this congress person for trying to put an end to that bs despite the current political climate
IAmA,not_removed,a down to earth politician whats the catch
IAmA,not_removed,httpimgurcomapadre and hes wearing a star wars shirt
IAmA,not_removed,haha hieroglyphic star wars
IAmA,not_removed,and heeeeeeeeeeeeeres gia httpimgurcomavoxnq
IAmA,not_removed,anything to get that vote they know our weaknesses and exploit them for power and money its a goddamn shame what our political system has become give me doggo or give me death
IAmA,not_removed,hi jared i just wanted to ask if you see this do you have any opinions on what can be done about gerrymandering do you foresee any workable strategy on attacking this issue i see it as the main thing keeping politicians with reasonable platforms locked out of so many seats thanks for fighting on these issues by the way
IAmA,not_removed,just for the record singlepayer is wildly popular among democrats
IAmA,not_removed,this its like asking why arent you taking any shots on goal to a midfielder when hes playing for a side thats two men down against a full team of eleven thats been on the attack and continues to be on attack the entire time they cant take these shots like medicare for all since they dont have the votes and they need to play defense to avoid having obamacare fall
IAmA,not_removed,alabamas not that bad we arent allowed to use the noose anymore
IAmA,not_removed,it could be he liked the original bill but an amendment was added that he really didnt like and that killed his ability to vote for it
IAmA,not_removed,knowing the pauls he did it to save face
IAmA,not_removed,definitely starting small and making slow transitions is the best way to get more people on board and make more change happen
IAmA,not_removed,or dont eat meat on friday holy toledo i think the catholic church may have been on to something
IAmA,not_removed,its amazing how much easier try to eat meat once a week or less is than total vegetarianism
IAmA,not_removed,write to your rep
IAmA,not_removed,youre often on the internet right stay on top of issues and argue firmly byt friendly whenever you see policy formed by ignorance
IAmA,not_removed,new york is going to be very split on this issue ive found that legalization has decent public support but elected officials are not eager to acknowledge it democrat or republican write email call your member of congress senators schumer and gillibrand and even your state senator and member of the assembly to propose a similar bill i suggest calling their local home office rather than their washingtonalbany office if youre in the rochester area im happy to help
IAmA,not_removed,maybe
IAmA,not_removed,i cant guarantee that
IAmA,not_removed,wow thanks for making the major effort award for most difficult upvote ever
IAmA,not_removed,having been to pa i do not recall any of this i think i did most my drinking in bars however now ky i distinctly remember how crazy that state wasis in one county we pulled up to a drive through place and bought a pint mixer and cups with ice right at a window without getting out of the car next county over dry no alcohol sales whatsoever
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i just moved here a year ago from a state with some of the laxest liquor laws missouri and its like bizzarro world when it comes to alcohol three separate stops for alcohol on the weekends and bars take underage drinking incredibly seriously
IAmA,not_removed,yea bars will sell six packs but usually at an upcost and while ive made many late night bar runs its never a preferred method
IAmA,not_removed,brings a tear to my eye sniff god bless the am standard mi resident
IAmA,not_removed,a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
IAmA,not_removed,that hes gay no problem in my book but might be a hard sell to the religious vote if this guy ever makes a run for president i was one of jareds constituents from to and ive kept an eye on him ever since the man is a class act a true saint
IAmA,not_removed,the catch is that op is actually the dog
IAmA,not_removed,he probably disagrees with you on at least thing
IAmA,not_removed,he doesnt get money from lobbyists thats the catch
IAmA,not_removed,maybe its that political leanings effect how we perceive the personalities of people we interact with and makes us like them additionally from the title i may have correctly ascertained that this was going to be a hugfest among democrats and found a comment to insert my unsurprise it is weird though how rare it is to see the followthrough
IAmA,not_removed,damn i already used my a surprise to be sure but a welcome one line on another comment
IAmA,not_removed,one of us one of us
IAmA,not_removed,did anybody notice the url says padre
IAmA,not_removed,can i i get a full pick of the shirt i love the dog but im so curious now
IAmA,not_removed,best congressman ever
IAmA,not_removed,dog payment satisfactory mob has quieted you may proceed to the next quest
IAmA,not_removed,what breed is she also please boop her snoot for us
IAmA,not_removed,oh my god shes adorable can you tell her shes a good girl for me
IAmA,not_removed,carpe canisem
IAmA,not_removed,computer science has at least a partial solution to the issue of gerrymandering you create an algorithm that optimizes district boundaries to maximize compactness im sure many people including myself have independently thought of the idea but has gotten some publicity for implementing it politicians are still necessary of course obviously youd need people like ujaredpolis tagged because i hope he does this to write and pass the law requiring use of the algorithm but youd also need them to decide things like httpbdistrictingcomabouthtmlcompact or how to define the initial conditions for example the algorithm i linked takes the existing districts as input and incrementally adds or subtracts census blocks along the edges the algorithm i thought of would be based on a httpsenwikipediaorgwikivoronoidiagram where the input seed points would be httpsenwikipediaorgwikicountyseat or something the point is there is no single ideal algorithm and there is no single globallyoptimal solution even using the same algorithm so there would still be plenty of stuff for the politicians to fight over at reapportionment time
IAmA,not_removed,nows really not the time for it though even if best case scenario the democratic party actually does line up behind it itll just be another partyline vote good luck getting any republicans to agree to pay for anything that doesnt go pew pew
IAmA,not_removed,rnocontext
IAmA,not_removed,they usually eat fish on those days though not the same issues but still notable issues with fishing nonetheless
IAmA,not_removed,and tell himher to support mr pollis bill each time one is introduced and at important stages thereafter and money either to mr poulos or a local campaign that you support it is sad that money play such an important role however since the supreme courts worst decision in the postworld war ii era citizens united money will play a role until that ruling is circumvented legislatively or overturned by the court itself until then money is going to be a large factor and unless you want two republican and brothers deciding whether and how you are going to obtain healthcare and make decisions about your body it takes some money to counter the money on the other side also it is important to realize the concern about money is not just because they can purchase endless advertising to influence voters it is because that money is also dangled over the politicians heads and is they dont vote they way they are told they dont get the money if lobbying wasnt already an insidious legal form of bribery citizens united makes it that much worse
IAmA,not_removed,well it certainly cant hurt damage already done its good that there are some people out there that are making positive comments about what to do about fixing it instead of just bitching about it
IAmA,not_removed,imho america will not follow south africa and canada as long as the republicans are in charge richard nixon declared a war on drugs back in it was ruled a felony to possess marijuana or heroine hippies were associated with pot blacks were associated with heroine they tend to vote democrat so they changed the law to remove voting rights from felons for life we have the highest rate of incarceration in the world in americans are in jail now not to mention all those ex cons and parolees thats an awful lot of democrats off of the voter rolls this in conjunction with computeraided gerrymandering and unnecessary votersuppression ensures a minority rule until they severely overreach things will have to get very bad before the lies and fingerpointingdemonizing false populism stops working
IAmA,not_removed,yes its definitely a last resort where abouts in pa are you
IAmA,not_removed,come join us in nevada we have the divide by zero standard
IAmA,not_removed,itll make a fine addition to add to my collection
IAmA,not_removed,rprequelmemes
IAmA,not_removed,too bad hes wearing a first order new republic shirt
IAmA,not_removed,source just about everyone in our political system does you have to backup a claim like that with a source id love to know
IAmA,not_removed,its treason then
IAmA,not_removed,a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
IAmA,not_removed,the attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed
IAmA,not_removed,congressdog
IAmA,not_removed,yeah it took me a while to transfer from my phone to computer because nothing is ever as easy as its supposed to be
IAmA,not_removed,shes a terrier mix almost years old adopted her as a puppy
IAmA,not_removed,i live in the lehigh valley which is nice cause most booze related stuff is always pretty local but i grew up in a super rural area so even the closest gas station was a good minute drive
IAmA,not_removed,time to abandon ship
IAmA,not_removed,first order and rebel alliance shirt hes the chosen one who will bring balance to the force house
IAmA,not_removed,check his opensecrets page very low amount of pac money taken most of it is individual contributions which are capped at or something
IAmA,not_removed,this summer rob schneider is congressdog coming this july weekend join the fight fur freedom also could have gone with put a paws on corruption
IAmA,not_removed,sounds like politics
IAmA,not_removed,worst swinging excursion
IAmA,not_removed,how do you decide if youre going to do it is there like an approval process or are you of the more the merrier camp
IAmA,not_removed,so are most of the couples white
IAmA,not_removed,are you ever going to consider marriage a serious relationship
IAmA,not_removed,why do the couples do it and do the husbands sometimes send you their wives and dont bother to watch
IAmA,not_removed,this is one kink ive never understood do you have any insight as to why a man would enjoy some other guy having sex with his wife in front of him ive even tried doing research and it seems like nobody really seems to have an answer suggestions include i think shes going to cheat on me so rather than getting shamed im going to own it or even biology says that when another male is present your sexual drive gets kicked into higher gear but that one doesnt make much sense to me since they arent really participating seems like you might have some good first hand knowledge
IAmA,not_removed,can i be your assistant
IAmA,not_removed,has any of the husbands requested action with you if so are you up to
IAmA,not_removed,if you sleep with girls a night when do you eat
IAmA,not_removed,why you and not any man on the street
IAmA,not_removed,so you just post flyers around town or what
IAmA,not_removed,why you
IAmA,not_removed,my question would be how did you get into this line of workwhy couldnt the husband do this themselves
IAmA,not_removed,ever had a situation where the husband got cold feet during but you and the wife continued anyway
IAmA,not_removed,crazy interesting life a few questions have you met anyone else in your situation describe yourself height looks on a scale of build dick size just curious to know if there are certain features that most couples look for
IAmA,not_removed,was the user name theprobonergigolo already taken
IAmA,not_removed,the article mentions an herbal pill that you say works better for you than viagra can you share any details on that
IAmA,not_removed,have you ever feared for your safety robberies or setups or for your health disease and whatnot
IAmA,not_removed,as a year old i didnt know this was a thing until someone linked rhotwife when did you find out this was a thing and how did you react i reacted how i should have by spending a good amount of time and arm effort
IAmA,not_removed,how did you get into the swinger life has it ever gotten in the way of any relationship youve had do you have a list of rules or anything that you make sure they know you will and will not do before hand
IAmA,not_removed,how hung are you grower and a shower
IAmA,not_removed,i was brand new to phoenix and i had been speaking with a couple online he sent me some pictures of his wife telling me she was really excited to meet me he must have sent me pictures of her in lingerie and different poses she had long red hair and was just a gorgeous woman the night of our scheduled meeting i began driving to the address he gave me turns out they lived in a bad area which didnt make a difference to me but it was the begining of a red flag i pulled up and he immediately opened the door and plumes of cigarette smoke came flying out to each his own but that was a red flag too i came in he said nice to meet you can please keep it down our daughter is asleep and pointed to a door feet from where we were standing i agreed and proceeded to greet the mrs who was seated on a couch in a sexy sky blue lingerie she got up to greet me gave me a hug a kiss on the cheek and as she stood back and smiled i noticed she had no less than teeth in her mouth and they were not in good condition she began kissing me on the neck meanwhile im panicking on the inside because there was no way this was going to work out for me at that precise moment i received a phone call it was a social phone call however i turned it into an emergency and told them i had to leave immediately and tend to a patient believe it or not that was worse than the dude with the swastika tattoo
IAmA,not_removed,its crucial to meet people in a social setting first when i first began i used to say the more the merrier however after being with some women i wasnt necessarily attracted to i realized i could be more selective meeting someone tells you if youre attracted to them also if the woman is into it or if its something her husband is pushing her into its very much like dating someone you wouldnt just jump into the sack with them sight unseen or maybe you would i wouldnt
IAmA,not_removed,yes happy birthday
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely im very open and not opposed to either when that happens ill have no issue giving this up
IAmA,not_removed,why couples do it is probably too hard a question to answer here everyone has their own reason some people do it to accentuate their sex life some people want to fix their sex life there are a myriad of reasons yes quite a few husbands have sent me their wives without watching some guys cant perform that well any more and they like to know shes still getting satisfied others like the idea of being at work and knowing their wife is at home doing something naughty
IAmA,not_removed,you know i have been asked if i have a friend id like to bring but because of my need for extreme discretion i never have anyone that comes to mind
IAmA,not_removed,i have had a few husbands ask if they can help the wife with me orally or if they can grab my penis and put it inside of the wife its not something that offends me however i it doesnt personally turn me on so i kindly decline
IAmA,not_removed,if the woman weighs more than in her picture its a deal breaker i have nothing against larger women but i dont like false advertisement also the wife is in anyway reluctant ill call things off immediately
IAmA,not_removed,i dont charge im the pro bono gigolo
IAmA,not_removed,there are usually fruit trays laid out so i snack on those in between
IAmA,not_removed,i mean i could ask why your wife and not some random slut on the street its about personality and the individuals character if i wanted random sex i could go into any random bar and pick up a girl
IAmA,not_removed,no its all done online at least initially
IAmA,not_removed,ive met other gentlemen that participate in this also ive been to parties that are cuckold parties where there are four of us but they dont happen to have my winning personality im darker completion short cropped hair muscular dick size is x but i dont think looks are all of it my personality is most of it imagine a gorgeous woman with big breasts but she also has a great personality it makes to so much better
IAmA,not_removed,no it was right there staring us in the face all along damn it
IAmA,not_removed,it used to be called goldrealla however there were some proprietary issues because there was some viagra in it so they had to stop selling it now its called the rhino series theres rhino black rhino they work fantastic up to days and theyre safe as long as you dont have any serious heart condition just to be clear i am not being paid by them
IAmA,not_removed,id probably give the same advice to a guy whos trying to get into the dating scene be yourself dont be pushy accept no is an answer youre going to hear sometimes nicely sometimes not so nicely dont get frustrated and never ever ever exaggerate your penis size also checking out some of the lifestyle sites is a good place to start
IAmA,not_removed,hahahah make out time with a toothless chick pretty good
IAmA,not_removed,holy fuck
IAmA,not_removed,i can relate to that youre my kinda guy no homo
IAmA,not_removed,holy shit thats some self confidence there
IAmA,not_removed,really wish i could answer this because im an ex mormon but i havent seen the musical
IAmA,not_removed,are you writing a term paper
IAmA,not_removed,youll have a better response if you come over to rexmormon and ask around there havent had a chance to see the musical but i love the soundtrack
IAmA,not_removed,hello sir i am rubel
IAmA,not_removed,there is no such thing as a former kgb agent vladimir putin
IAmA,not_removed,ve vill ask ze qvestions
IAmA,not_removed,im afraid most of them will be either in league with putin or may have died from a completely accidental poisoning
IAmA,not_removed,nice try cia
IAmA,not_removed,vladimir putin
IAmA,not_removed,i think you are confusing the kgb with the stasi
IAmA,not_removed,accidental
IAmA,not_removed,heh they think we will give up our secret hideout in west addison chi il suckers they will never know
IAmA,not_removed,are you welsh
IAmA,not_removed,are you a dragon
IAmA,not_removed,do you roar
IAmA,not_removed,will there be an api to create apps or ifttt scripts to change the imagetext automatically the way we choose
IAmA,not_removed,do you wish to become your own clothing brand like hugo boss or would you rather be a company which lets other brands use your technology
IAmA,not_removed,how much will weight the battery can you assure us it will not be visible or create strange forme on a side of the shirt
IAmA,not_removed,how did you get the idea to build led tshirts
IAmA,not_removed,do you like cookies
IAmA,not_removed,were you born in india did you go to iit
IAmA,not_removed,got any free samples ◔◔ d
IAmA,not_removed,hey have you been thinking to integrate the smart shirt with a lyrics app when a track will be played the lyrics will be dislayed and flow over the tshirt or way more cooler a software that will recognize the track being played like shazham and display the lyrics on the tshirt
IAmA,not_removed,can we have different t shirt styles like ralph lauren plus in flash sale we are buying more do we get discount on shipping
IAmA,not_removed,have you been thinking to make a special editon version i mean a special colour like tealturquoiseblurple blurple is the most special
IAmA,not_removed,the normal wear time is nearly from morning till evening atleast that comes around hours but hrs which u assured is very very low
IAmA,not_removed,and the look of the tshirt is too old fashioned i think contrast colored collar and arm ends must be tried since full plain color tshirt is old fashioned
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr nagubandi igg has been discredited in the crowdfunding community many times because of the many scams that have been and are still taking place especially on the technology section campaigns like ritot comet fontus and skarp have made headlines in many sites for their dubious practices designed to get monetary support from naive backers who dont look too closely at the campaign igg have very lax rules about setting up a campaign and prototypes are not required what do you think about those practices and how can you assure your backers than your campaign will deliver what they promise
IAmA,not_removed,the first version of the api will allow you to send messages from the web or where you can send one single message or image to multiple tshirts i like the idea of ifttt i will share this with my team and explore the possibility of including this thanks
IAmA,not_removed,for generations people have worn clothes and there is hardly any innovation designs have changed and fabrics have changed but there hasnt been any innovation to clothes we believe that we have ideas that change the way people wear clothes we want to become our own clothing brand and introduce lot of garments tshirt is our first idea
IAmA,not_removed,the battery thickness is about mm we are working with various vendors to reduce the thickness assure you that it wont look strange on the side or feel uncomfortable
IAmA,not_removed,we got this idea couple of months back the idea was a result of one of the discussions we had we were discussing about mens and womens clothing and realised that men have very few options as compared to women in mens wear there is very little innovation possible for the shirt the only garment we thought at that point of time there was a possibility was tshirt people wear tshirts with messages and images and these messages change based on age mood occasion why cant a single tshirt display messages based on anyones mood or occasion the led tshirt idea is the answer to the above question
IAmA,not_removed,will the shirt set off walkthrough metal detectors such as in airports
IAmA,not_removed,yes i was born in india no i did not go to iit
IAmA,not_removed,happy to know that you find our tshirt interesting we want to change the way people wear clothes we will be announcing our next product in the next couple of days we are working on a shirt womens garments at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,we are bootstrapped unfortunately we cannot give free samples at this point of time
IAmA,not_removed,havent thought about integrating the lyrics app do you think it is a idea that people will like
IAmA,not_removed,yu get a different price for shipping when you buy more tshirts the application calculates and displays the price accordingly if you want a discount please send an email to hellobroadcastwearcom and we will get in touch with you
IAmA,not_removed,special edition idea is good at stretch goal we will unlock game play we can have the special edition tshirt as the next stretch goal after we reach
IAmA,not_removed,we spoke to lot of people and demonstrated the tshirt lot of people shared that they may not keep the same message displayed based on this feedback we created the tshirt with battery life of about hours if all the leds are lit then the battery life is about hours when only some leds are lit then the battery life increases
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion i will share this input with our design team and see what best we can do
IAmA,not_removed,the metal detectors will detect that the tshirt has a battery and micro controller
IAmA,not_removed,will the shirt set off walkthrough metal detectors such as in airports
IAmA,not_removed,bummer p never hurts to try i guess good luck with your shirt and if you ever do d
IAmA,not_removed,i think only if itll integrate with shazam recognition engine for exmaple the software will be running on background and turing shows it will automatically load the lyrics for each track automaticlly its a nice idea and lots of people will love it but it does require getting with the right people over shazam any other similar software
IAmA,not_removed,the metal detectors will detect that the tshirt has a battery and micro controller
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the idea we have shared out tshirt idea to lot of people and have incorporated most of the ideas weve heard i will share this idea with the team and ask them to explore the possibility
IAmA,not_removed,i wish you the best it would be super fun wearing your tshirt in big festivals around the world everyone would be jealous
IAmA,not_removed,i was a security officer for over yrs so i can help with a couple of those there are ways of getting in that position the first is simply being a security officer for the company that is providing security for said event most of the time the company will just position their parttime officers that are already on call if its a slightly larger event they will use their parttimers as well as some of the full time officers will be offered overtime positions to help cover the event if its a very large event like san diego comic con the compan in charge will do all of the above as well as put postings out for temporary employees a regular person would simply apply and interview as any other job position ive never really had anything too crazy happen at an even that people pay to attent festivals concerts the craziest things that ive personally been evolved in happened at sites like walmart during black friday the rude fans customers at such events are usually just a little too drunk someone might want to get on stage or back stage without permission i was at lillith fair and bonnie raitt slapped someone that was attempting to sneak backstage after that i was forced to escort the person off property as long as you are in uniform you are supposed to act professional at all times so no alcohol no eating drinking smoking in public view no dancing and no fraternizing with the patrons were there to provide safety and assistance in the case that something goes awry the hiring process is the same as any security position no criminal record no visable tattoos unless you can cover them up are the only real things that seem universal with the security companies ive worked for they dont always tell you where youll be working you will be told a date time and address of your work schedule if you are hired as a temp then you might recognize the information and know beforehand where youre going but it usually isnt specifically told alright youre going to be working such and such concert when i worked at comic con people applied because they recognized the information in the job posting timedatelocation and when they arrived they were usually placed at an entrance exit and stationed there for the entire shift
IAmA,not_removed,how thoroughly do you search people ive been to concerts where it ranged from full pat down balls included while another officer hardly looked and then the vip line wasnt searched at all
IAmA,not_removed,this is usually decided either beforehand by the venue or by us based on how heavy the traffic flow is if the venue wants specific instructions then we have to do it that way because they are the ones paying us to be there if the venue just wants random inspections or doesnt really provide clear instructions then we base it on how heavy the flow of traffic is light traffic usually a fair bit before the even starts pat down most people that come in med traffic about hr before event search every people heavy traffic even is starting soom search out of some guards will use this traffic as justification to search nobody as it holds the line as for how thorough if the venue wants us to check pockets bags etc thats what we have to do if they dont provide specifics here we just normally do just simple pat downs on the outside portion of the torso and waist
IAmA,not_removed,sadly koko isnt much more than a hoax with the interpreter interpreting to fit the situation
IAmA,not_removed,shes not a hoax but she has been used and over sold for an agenda which is a real shame its actually quite tragic because we arent seeing the reality of what gorilla cognition is capable of through the haze of the foundations coaching agenda and manipulation she actually has a really funny attitude and personality but its not very pchas been known to grab nipples and call people shitty poopy toilets and definitely not going to make her an attractive spokesanimal for pennys lobbying
IAmA,not_removed,no what is saying is that on the rare occasions where theyve had an independent third party interpret kokos signing its been nothing but nonsense at best random gestures that arent actually signs at worst theres never been any actual communication when kokos handlers havent been interpreting it its basically the animalcognition equivalent of facilitated communication
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a source for this because this is not what ive heard
IAmA,not_removed,there seems to be a problem with your account that must be fixed at the admin level you can contact them using the link below im afraid we are unable to assist you further
IAmA,not_removed,is that nice ice tea
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about america and its response to the war in syria does the idf have a technicalhacking unit
IAmA,not_removed,what are your views and opinion regarding the united states and the us military whats your mosjob were you a volunteer or were you conscripted what would you do if isis somehow attacked israel what do you think of the israelpalestine situation like are the claims about israeli troops using force against palestinians actually true or are they sometimes bogus
IAmA,not_removed,what is your favorite species of bird
IAmA,not_removed,how long was your training and what roles do you have responsibleties and duties
IAmA,not_removed,did you have to shoot someone in the time you served so far where are you usually stationed also do you have any moral problems with serving in the idf
IAmA,not_removed,how old you are you fight against someone if you under im very fear about your future or something
IAmA,not_removed,are you from israel where did you learn to speak such fluent english the fact that you even know the common english abbreviation is very impressive goodluck out there
IAmA,not_removed,what is it like to serve with the worlds most beautiful female soldiers any good stories how do you feel about manditory service
IAmA,not_removed,yes it is
IAmA,not_removed,imo all responses to syria are just to even to state not to finish the war since this state is good for everyone else isis assad etc they consider both enemies so they dont care if they kill each other yes we do
IAmA,not_removed,i think its too political goes into wars for oil and money more than survivle wars foot soldier serving mostly in the jordanian border there is mandatory service in israel volunteers are mostly people from abroad wanting to serve here fight them probably since thats one of the reasons my battalion was created of them are false or they just show you half the picture palestinians purposely trigger andor attack israeli soldiers and as soon as they try to do anything about it they start filming them those are most of the videos we question or arrest someone they act like heros and hit the soldiers than his family starts filming and edits the video basicly cant win actual fights or battles so they try to win the media if anything israel should have less restrictions on the soldiers imo because now lets say an arab throws a rock at me im not even allowed to react to it regardless of size strength or we i mean even if someone threw a moltov at me as soon as it is out of his hand im not allowed to open fire
IAmA,not_removed,ravens
IAmA,not_removed,changes between battalions platoons and draft cycles mine was months long our role is mostly to protect the jordanian border and to fight isis in case of an attack among other things to capture drug smugglers and illegal workers
IAmA,not_removed,not yet usually stationed in between the dead see and eilat and no im just protecting my family and friends as far as im consured never was given an order to fuck with someone for no reason
IAmA,not_removed,im and its ok everyone here serves for at least years so its not like im throwing my future
IAmA,not_removed,not bad im actually in a mixed gender battalion so quite a lot of stories and fun one is when someone threatened to blow up a hotel unless everyone would be evacuated in mins ended up as nothing but got a shit ton of forces over there and lots of stories about the female soldiers since everyone is away from home for a few weeks and you know get lonely about mandatory servoce its a mixed opinion i guess lots of desk soldiers doing nothing but i suppose there are still more combat soldiers because of that since people say im there for years so i might aswell do my best
IAmA,not_removed,follow up questionsif you dont mind are there things that you like or applaudrespect america for if so what are they what do you think of donald trumpthe egotistic and ignorant idiot and hillary clintonthe shady lying i need computer classes idiot how do you think as an israeli soldier that the current israelpalestine situation could be resolved peacefully do you enjoy your service any scary storieslike as in you saw this weird creature walking around or something
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the response just wandering how long do you have left in the army and then you can leave retire
IAmA,not_removed,thanks follow up question and an obscure one at that do you have any knowledge about a numbers station named it was speculated that it was run by mossad but rumors were it was actually military in nature
IAmA,not_removed,caracal battallion
IAmA,not_removed,well i like the opportunists that a big cpuntry like that provides also the respect for you have veterans here its mostly every times theres a war people remember to support the tropps other than that most of them dont care both of them are morons imo and unfit to run the country at moments its mostly boring but you do have good people with you so you make the most out of it hmm nothing like that had a few times where we expected to be fired on but everything turned put well
IAmA,not_removed,got untill march
IAmA,not_removed,never heard of it tbh sounds like something to ask someone at serving at intelligence but even if they do know i guess its classified
IAmA,not_removed,last question who do you dislike the most trump or clinton
IAmA,not_removed,oh hope it goes out well and stay safe
IAmA,not_removed,thanks again
IAmA,not_removed,is it true that after idf soldiers kill muslims they turn into lizards and then feast on the dead bodies and absorb their soul to hail satan
IAmA,not_removed,trump
IAmA,not_removed,not that i heard of
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwcheckcom out lane merrifield lanemerrifield httpwwwcheckcom out spike hike spikehikecp
IAmA,not_removed,hope this becomes fulfilled im a player of toontown rewritten and former club penguin
IAmA,not_removed,if i told you i thought this was just another pumpanddump cryptocurrency how would you explain to me why its not
IAmA,not_removed,as a citizen of the united kingdom as is the rest of our small team currentlywe recognise the potential turmoil our economy may be facing and we would like to take this opportunity and try to do something that could perhaps depending on how successful we are at reaching a larger audience there could be opportunities here for people that may wish to hedge their bets a little and maybe just maybe it could help those in need in the future
IAmA,not_removed,i understand hillary is awful but in my opinion donald trump is the definition of an unqualified candidate for leader of the most powerful military force on the planet take an outsider and show them the recent debate its obvious who has the better common sense and temperment yea yea i know its cool to say if so and so is elected this country is fucked however i feel that is an accurate statement with trump with hillary nothing may change and thats the worse case scenario shes an experienced politician she knows how to handle things i dont want to imagine the worst case scenario for a trump presidency my question is do you think trump is truly mentally stable to run this country or is it more of a fuck the establishment vote is it a team spirit vote where you will stick with your party through thick and thin no matter how outthere the candidate is
IAmA,not_removed,what policies of his do you agree with
IAmA,not_removed,what did you think when trump said wages where too high
IAmA,not_removed,have you seen the countless instances where hes contradicted himself how can you support someone who cant seem to stay consistent with his opinions on major issues and do you really think the numerous news sources that disprove his words are all lying
IAmA,not_removed,so with trump pushing for trade tariffs do you realize that means higher prices for you everything imported at walmart and target will get more expensive by a lot
IAmA,not_removed,honest question i hope you dont read this as sarcasm what would trump have to say for you to not vote for him
IAmA,not_removed,how much will you enjoy continuing to work minimum wage jobs after the election
IAmA,not_removed,only half of trump supporters are deplorable are you sure you are one of them
IAmA,not_removed,where do you get your news and information from mainly did you watch the congressional hearings on clintons emails would you say you are relatively happy in your life at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,was he your first choice among the candidates in the republican primaries who was and how did you feel when trump came out ahead
IAmA,not_removed,hi iam from germany so all media here a not really taking trump serious as politician can you take him as one i would be full of fear that he cant handle the foreign policy
IAmA,not_removed,why do you say deplorable seriously
IAmA,not_removed,have you considered to invest that time in finding a betterpaid job rather than well whatever you do there
IAmA,not_removed,i guess the obvious question is why
IAmA,not_removed,do you grasp the concept that he is his own special interest how do you laugh off the fact that if he was really worth billion we all know thats pure bullshit his only articulated tax reform would save his estate billion do you really believe he gives a flying fuck about anyone else but himself and his family
IAmA,not_removed,my question is do you think trump is truly mentally stable to run this country or is it more of a fuck the establishment vote much like bernie sanders and the dnc the republican establishment hate trump america right now distrusts the media and certainly he has been attracting much of the antiestablishment vote but i think he really will be a great tempered president while in office ive read donalds book from and in it explains his philosophy well the point is that if you are a little different or a little outrageous or if you do things that are bold or controversial the press is going to write about you ― donald j trump trump the art of the deal
IAmA,not_removed,since there are too many to list ill instead list some of his that i disagree with banning muslim immigration barring a religion is inhumane i believe banning immigration from countries would be better instead bringing back water boarding forcing tech companies to hand over data to the fbi
IAmA,not_removed,i thought he was human he quickly redacted that statement so i think he just misspoke
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,he is quite inconsistent he says controversial things and sometimes redacts them he sometimes even contradicts himself in the same day however that doesnt seem to bother me very much because it tells me he isnt a puppet who has donors pulling the strings on his stances the mere fact that he largely self funded his campaign allows him to go off message as he pleases his antiestablishment vibes resonate with me more than his inconsistencies
IAmA,not_removed,as in my response to another question trade is my number one reason for supporting trump my city was once one of americas richest cities due to industry now thanks to nafta all high paying factory stem jobs moved to mexico do i worry about prices rising for the consumer not as much as i worry about losing all industry in america if chinese made goods raise in price then so be it
IAmA,not_removed,if he suddenly became liberal or suddenly supported many of their policies i would have to hear it from himself not through a mainstream media anchor or a bunch of edited clips mischaracterizing what he said
IAmA,not_removed,i enjoy my work now i just dont enjoy the pay i regularly work hw and bring home less than i am in military inactive reserves so my future might be different soon
IAmA,not_removed,i am in the inactive army reserve and ready to fight and die for my country if called upon hillary can call her pawns of military service deplorable just as i can call her handling of her email server deplorable
IAmA,not_removed,i listen to talk radio hosts ben sharpio micheal savage rush limbaugh alex jones milo yiannopoulos etc httpdrudgereportcom is my homepage it is a collection of news articles from an altright perspective i browse rthedonald and frequently i know most media outlets are heavily partisan and most of the mainstream ones lean left i typically try to go to different websites to get different points of view however i do more often than not read sources that confirm my conservative biasesjust as most people do
IAmA,not_removed,i was initially going to support rand paul but in august i switched my support to trump after watching him in the debates i consider myself altright and trump seemed to fit my views best if i had to list the alternatives to trump i would have supported in order donald trump rand paul ben carson ted cruz chris christie mike huckabee
IAmA,not_removed,the alternative is amazingly worse
IAmA,not_removed,gee there is so much i could type to condense my response ill stick my main reason trade i live in httpwwwreuterscominvestigatesspecialreportusainsecuritymuncie a city of who has lost factory jobs since my father worked for a union factory borgwarner for years it paid and he was well off before it httpwwwwthrcomarticleborgwarnerannouncesmuncieplanttoclose and moved to mexico in forcing him to downgrade to a job that pay to half what he made before he lost all his retirement years and foreclosed on his home in my city was once americas booming city thanks to nafta it is a wasteland
IAmA,not_removed,i believe he is acting in his own self interest in the area that he is a narcissist but not to his own assets or company he has self funded tens of millions of dollars to his own campaign he could have simply used other peoples money but he used his own
IAmA,not_removed,so he is tricking you just putting on a whacky act in order to obtain some more publicity i can tell you this he never planned on getting this far everything he says lacks has any sort of substance he just says things
IAmA,not_removed,what establishment is he anti to to me the people who set the establishment are the ones with the money thats the one thing trump sees the value of money hes even more establishment than the establishment as a low income hard worker do you think trump is interested in bettering your situation to him youre a loser do you think that trump figuring out how to not pay taxes is going to trickle down to you he only gets away with it because he has mountains of money the greatest con of all time is making people choose what isnt in their own best interest mindless cattle marching to their demise with indignant and self satisfied smiles
IAmA,not_removed,military inactive reserves my future might be different soon isnt trump planning on cutting defense
IAmA,not_removed,that doesnt answer the question are you one of his racist and sexist supporters if not then you arent deplorable
IAmA,not_removed,explain why shes worsewith actual facts dont just say shes worse and expect people to not want an explanation
IAmA,not_removed,sorry but nafta is not what screwed it all up the fact is that the jobs were leaving they were either going to china mexico or canada he lost retirement because republicans have repeatedly let companies weasel out commitments
IAmA,not_removed,oh and unions have lost all their power because of douche bags like trump and pence
IAmA,not_removed,it was greedy pigs like trump who wanted cheaper prices for their goods that contracted with overseas manufacturing
IAmA,not_removed,um im really not sure what that has to do with the presidential election to the best of my knowledge and feel free to correct me if im wrong but trump favors economic reform closer the regans trickle down which would mean that your father would actually make less since nafta doesnt effect domestic commerce and any tax breaks would be higher than your fathers income bracket i am really having a hard time understanding your stance
IAmA,not_removed,trump revealed his plan for raising defense spending just a few weeks ago
IAmA,not_removed,calling half of trump supporters deplorable and irredeemable is quite frankly bigoted i wrap myself with the word deplorable because it demonstrates how tolerant the opposition is to people with differing opinions i stopped wearing my make america great again hat in public because whenever i did i was harassed by random people on the street but no if you may insist i am not racist sexist homophobic xenophobic islamaphobic you name it the mere fact that the media dehumanizes trump supporters just makes trumps base grow larger
IAmA,not_removed,i hold conservative views so of course i find her to be bad in my mind but if you want me to list some of my biggest complaints about her that arent philosophical disagreements then you just have to look at her record her years as secretary of state were a complete disaster her response to the arab spring uprisings was to arm the rebels which backfired majorly her handling of benghazi was atrocious and most importantly her private server where she sent classified material through was hacked and who knows how many countries have intel on us now she is a puppet of the donors who have funded her for the last years anytime she flip flops on a stance its because the public no longer finds her stance favorable she only supported gay marriage and antitpp when public opinion polls those opinions to be favorable
IAmA,not_removed,just makes trumps base grow larger source
IAmA,not_removed,hey i love your youtube videos im just wandering how long do these type of videos takes you to produce and what type of work goes into it
IAmA,not_removed,whats your favorite time periodmoment in history also id like a video on the english civil wars they make a great story
IAmA,not_removed,your work looks amazing and ill have a gander as soon as i can but would you ever want to do a history of psuedoscience if you could get spirit science in there then i think thatd be great
IAmA,not_removed,you said you like the world wars history the most but what part do you like out of them most i have friends who can name every division in some battles and others who can name seemingly every flying ace and their history do you focus on the political or geopolitical side or the people side either the psychology how people performed in battle and the homefront wws is so fascinating because you can be very generalist and be very indepth
IAmA,not_removed,i like your cartoons and the concept i think having this is better than not having this if i may offer a critique i find your narrator incredibly boring he takes the excitement right out of the product it doesnt match the cartoon i think for this to really grab viewers it needs to be much more fast paced and have more pop to it have you seen this consider that every single viewer of todays audience has adhd the narrator from the oxford book of british kings and queens may be right up the alley of your standard history buff but isnt going to get todays youth interested in history
IAmA,not_removed,on average how many hours does it take you to animate video o and what is your full time job
IAmA,not_removed,have you done anything on the ottoman front of wwi
IAmA,not_removed,any chance of getting a julie daubigny video
IAmA,not_removed,this is my first time arriving to an ama before it closes d okay my questions are any chance of a video highlighting the first woman to ever run for president of the us victoria woodhull is a very fascinating person any chance of videos about historical events in eastern or middle eastern countries like maybe about the chinese interacting with the romans for example
IAmA,not_removed,my favorite part of history is the american presidents something about this job and the people who take it up always interest me do you have plans for any presidential events jfk shooting watergate etc and who is your favorite president
IAmA,not_removed,how far back in history do you intend to go and what sort of history do you intend to teach as in will you stick strictly to orthodox teachings or include alternative theories and leave things up the viewers do you think that its important for everyone to think about our history in the same way and accept the same model what about historical bias will you depict people events and civilisations as being good or bad or be neutral and objective is there anywhere in particular you will focus on or will all countries and cultures be covered and lastly how accurate and indepth will you be will you avoid making generalisations and assumptions or try to simplify things so its easier for the average person to understand
IAmA,not_removed,would it be possible to do one on the crusade of varna also do you play games like and
IAmA,not_removed,what are your thoughts on italian organised crime more specifically the mafia will you ever do a video about them
IAmA,not_removed,how would i find the books you mentioned you make i would be interested in these for when my son grows up im a history buff but have always had a hard time capturing my attention without illustrations i think what you do is amazing and i cant wait to watch more of your videos side note i dont agree with the comments on the videos being boring of course they arent action packed exiting videos they are simplified facts and fulfill theyre purpose
IAmA,not_removed,when can we expect the animated version of the usa dropping large condoms that are labeled as small on german forces during wwii
IAmA,not_removed,this stuff is super cool as an aspiring upcoming history teacher this is fun to watch for my question where do you get your narrators from is there a process
IAmA,not_removed,will you take into the account historical accuracy or just the story at taught in the west
IAmA,not_removed,which one of your videos have you had the most trouble creating
IAmA,not_removed,how do you you ensure as much historical neutrality as possible obviously history is written by the victor and a lot of modern western history is incredibly embellished
IAmA,not_removed,do you have sentcils or library of things already produced how do you maintain that library
IAmA,not_removed,what encouraged you to start making these shorts btw i am a huge history buff aswell and i love your short films
IAmA,not_removed,can you do the paraguay war
IAmA,not_removed,you mentioned that you studied history in university then did you learn animation by yourself if so was it difficult to learn by the way i love your videos
IAmA,not_removed,wow thanks for doing this what a great educational tool how do you address issuescontext that is embarrassing such as the opium wars whose perspective would this be told from request history of kemet propaganda information wars
IAmA,not_removed,is there any chance of you covering the ussr if so can you guarantee youll check american claims of what it was like for accuracy there was a lot of propaganda in the and on from both sides that is still pervasive
IAmA,not_removed,what program do you use to animate any good tutorials on it
IAmA,not_removed,i teach grade history and i love people like you i am very animated about my content and am always trying to find new resources to reach students who dont like my approach or simply need a different angle the rise of educational youtube channels has been incredibly helpful have you ever considered looking over bigger states educational standards and creating items tailored to common themes if you could pitch it to teachersdistricts in this way you may be able to leverage this into a major business opportunity
IAmA,not_removed,agincourt is on the list i hope
IAmA,not_removed,why do you want to do this what motivates you to do this
IAmA,not_removed,is theres a chance of seeing gallipoli campaign canakkale savası video that war was kinda important
IAmA,not_removed,do you plan on do any videos about the hun empire and the mongols or golden horde
IAmA,not_removed,are you planning on covering specific subjects such as the history of aircraft as well as general history
IAmA,not_removed,teacher here do you use the social studies standards to create your videos this is a gold mine for schools
IAmA,not_removed,how fucking early do you wake up on sundays
IAmA,not_removed,have you heard of horrible histories series
IAmA,not_removed,i love these can you do the romans leaving and the english anglo saxons coming from germany please
IAmA,not_removed,do you need any male voice actors im willing to offer my services
IAmA,not_removed,what do you think of the francoprussian war
IAmA,not_removed,do you plan on doing a christmas special
IAmA,not_removed,ive seen historical recreations of tank battles on the ahc channel but they seem dated have you thought about teaming up with a someone very knowledgeable in and create something similar
IAmA,not_removed,can you do siege of vienna
IAmA,not_removed,will you do any persian or middle eastern videos
IAmA,not_removed,do you focus mostly on military history or would you do cartoons on economic history like the origin of the rise of the or that time that aaron burr founded the manhattan water company that he actually turned into a bank
IAmA,not_removed,woo i went to school with you glad youre doing so good since this has to be a question so it doesnt get deleted hows the youtube format working out for you is the passion more about the history so you dont really care what format its on or would you prefer to be just a youtube or just an author
IAmA,not_removed,have you considered partnering with badass of the week if not you should check it out note resubmitted because first post wasnt a question and im dumb
IAmA,not_removed,do you like your job what motivated you to do it
IAmA,not_removed,how long would it take to create an animated cartoon depicting real life events eg celebrities just alone if it was your only job
IAmA,not_removed,will you do one on the ottoman empire
IAmA,not_removed,how about that nullification crisis
IAmA,not_removed,how do you plan to expand and improve your channel the artwork is near and i know you have another job but the videos seem a bit dull
IAmA,not_removed,no thanks
IAmA,not_removed,those who control the past control the future so exactly which ideology are ya selling
IAmA,not_removed,wow subbed to your channel do you limit yourself to creating animation for significant world events only please do one of the philippines overthrowing of ferdinand marcos
IAmA,not_removed,will you do the gold rush
IAmA,not_removed,i watched your brief wwii history video i have two suggestions dont make derpy and silly faces on anyone even hitler this sets a precedent of bias even though it may seem small and innocent i believe history should generally be told as unbiased as possible even when someone was clearly in the wrong by todays standards take more time i would rather see minutes of a high quality video than minutes of a meh quality video see in a nutshell for an example its the only channel ive subscribed to youtube has infinite videos whats separating yours from everyone elses
IAmA,not_removed,the first step is writing up the scripts this is hard since the information has to be accurate as its educational this can take a good half of a day depending on how complex the subject is the animating part takes a few days as im mainly doing it after work and a illustrator and a volunteer animator is helping on the odd scene in their spare time
IAmA,not_removed,this is the latest video the treaty of versailles what did the big three want httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvryhlnqmrro
IAmA,not_removed,that would be the world wars
IAmA,not_removed,haitian revolution at first im doing alot of subjects i studied at university and have a familiarity with but i plan on covering almost everything in history i also want to represent the lesser known parts of history the main thing the further you back with is the costume accuracy as i am drawing everything i have to research the costumes from reenactors and online illustrations like osprey books the further you go back the harder it is
IAmA,not_removed,spirit science its a possibility although it would take a lot of research on my part as i am not familiar with this topic i would like to do videos celebrating scientists in history like einstein
IAmA,not_removed,i dont go that focused in like battle strategies and maps etc i am into the battles broadly the technology weapons factions campaigns
IAmA,not_removed,i have to agree the narration needs a little more excitement pop i watched the blitzkrieg and it just didnt fully grab me the accent is nice just the excitementpacing seemed off anyways looks great so far best of luck
IAmA,not_removed,agreed just speeding it up a bit would do wonders the narrator was too slow for me and im mid love what youre doing though keep it up
IAmA,not_removed,speak for your own generation grandpappy
IAmA,not_removed,to be honest i havent timed the amount of hours yet but it is taking me about days to finish the videos and add all those layers of sound on top i am a video editor for a elearning project so similar to this
IAmA,not_removed,no but ive written up a script on the gallipoli campaign so expect to see this soon in a week or two
IAmA,not_removed,i have an idea for a playlist icons of history
IAmA,not_removed,this would make an interesting video womens history is definetly something i want to make videos about i think this video is a good start although it was criticised for being anglo centric lesson learned httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhbtqcpgjei i actually did my dissertation on the crusades i found it a fascinating topic we have made a video on the great wall of china built during the ming dynasty and i also wrote a whole book on the history of china from the first emperor to the qing dynasty it was very difficult to get reference images for the costumes of soldiers ie during the warring states periods
IAmA,not_removed,ive written and illustrated a book on the cold war so jfk and nixons characters have been drawn up for these videos heres a page from it can you notice the water gate easter egg
IAmA,not_removed,when there is a n established community around the channel i will make videos on what the audience want to see the most
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps the further you go back the less sources have survived and the more interpretation there is i would therefore have to show this in videos ie the crusades i think its impossible for people to think of history exactly the same way as everyones experiences and upbringings are different and therefore their interpretations are different although you could argue that the way nations view their role in history are often very bias i will try not to show icons of history in too much of a black and white way their mistakes should be known as much as their victories the idea is to have the videos short and snappy and cover one specific topic event without too much waffle some people wont like this style as it may appear too simplistic but learning history can often have so much information overload you dont know where to start and it can certainly put you off learning if you are a pupil or student so i hope that i can help with that
IAmA,not_removed,possibly would take alot of visual research is this featured in those games i am a big gamer and love games with a historical setting in regards to strategy rise of nations and age of empires i also thing games are an amazing way to connect with history and feel like you were there
IAmA,not_removed,i have written a book on the roaring twenties and dirty thirties looking at alcapone and others during prohibition i think this needs the video treatment
IAmA,not_removed,if you pm me your email ill send you one of them as an ebook so you can see thank you for your kind words
IAmA,not_removed,after fx and flash fir animation and to edit the video premiere illustrator to do the drawings i would like my pc to be able to real time render faster
IAmA,not_removed,i asked around on a forum showing them the stuff i had done before this is very important as anyone can say what they are going to do and alot of time they never do anything i was then flooded with emails from amazing voice actors who wanted to record narrations
IAmA,not_removed,til every single historical story in the west is inaccurate
IAmA,not_removed,we were taught in university that with history there is always the writers bias i try to be impartial but this can be impossible at times the videos are more informative rather than analytical however
IAmA,not_removed,people are downvoting you but this is a legitimate question
IAmA,not_removed,lets not talk about the rape of nanking sp dont care
IAmA,not_removed,anything specific you have a problem with
IAmA,not_removed,you sound like one of my old history professors a man who said that lenin was a good man and it wasnt until stalin that all the bad shit happened in the ussr
IAmA,not_removed,the world war ii overview one httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhuqyoqvvti is rather complex being that we are not looking merely at one event but several on the timeline this means that several characters have to be drawn up secondly i animate in both flash and after fx now both have offered me problems for one flash crashes of the time doing anything and is very volatile after fx meanwhile guarentees a safer environment for animating but is less fluid for doing in and the files sizes just for one shot are often for a few seconds of footage the shot here for example is like that you have a zoom in and wiggle effects
IAmA,not_removed,the sources im using are as impartial and factual as possible
IAmA,not_removed,yeh ive got a library building up from illustrating and producing the book part of the series here is just one set of characters drawn up in illustrator for the stalingrad battle scene in overview
IAmA,not_removed,i have been writing the books and illustrating them for two years and originally saw youtube as a way to market but instead of making annoying adverts i thought that i could make something worthwhile thats fun and people could learn from i am obsessed with history and studied it at a world class university my family also love history what i noticed on youtube is that there arent any animated cartoon history channels they either have a presenter most of the time which i personally find a bit boring or they have power point style animation with little care for costume accuracy etc so basically in short wanted to make something i wanted to see and what others might like as well
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps but not for a long time as i am unfamiliar with this subject
IAmA,not_removed,yeh i am self taught of course were are not going for the best animation in the world with these videos but enough that it gives an interesting history learning experience thanks d
IAmA,not_removed,history of kemet i would try to be impartial but while i dont know much about the opium wars its generally seen as a very bad thing that britain has done in its past im british good request i was fascinated with ancient egypt as a kid no obsessed i will have to make some videos on the subject asap
IAmA,not_removed,yes ive already written a book on the russian revolution cold war and one on the space race and i studied soviet history for years at university very interesting topic ive also written up a script for the russian revolution so keep tuned
IAmA,not_removed,i have to say everyones journey was unique from where they went after uni personally i took on an entrepreneurial angle and i dont teach history in my job now perhaps with any humanities i would say its good to self teach yourself skills on the side for when it comes to the real world because employers wanted to see these more ie my ability in after fx but this channel and its books are where i continue my love of history in short most people i know have gone onto to do well after studying history and didnt just go into teaching
IAmA,not_removed,flash which is quicker but crashes alot and after fx i just learnt using youtube tutorials and trial and error
IAmA,not_removed,thats good to hear i remember as a pupil how difficult it was to learn dates and remember facts and figures because there was no anchor to it then our teachers tried this thing where we would draw cartoon strips of every event this without doubt helped me get a grades on my modules in history and it inspired my history books and these videos basically i think getting the information overload like you get in the boring black and white textbooks reduced is key visualizing these events too helps kids to remember the facts ive looked at and the american educational syllabuses as a bit of a guide
IAmA,not_removed,thats a good one i actually have some footage of reenactors doing the battle of agincourt without any crowd in the background so could mix in some of that with the animation
IAmA,not_removed,being a history buff and an artist i wanted to combine these two things
IAmA,not_removed,ive already written the script for it and choosing the right narrator so you will see this one very soon
IAmA,not_removed,yes in the future as these will take more research
IAmA,not_removed,yes i love world war technology in particular weapons and tanks and well military history in general changes in technology can dramatically change the outcome of war like the invention of the radar
IAmA,not_removed,alot of the content and sources are from academic and school resources i hope you make good use of the videos in your class
IAmA,not_removed,yes i have
IAmA,not_removed,yes i have done a roman book on hannibal julius casear so a video should be made on the romans
IAmA,not_removed,you can send a show reel or read a line to simplehistorybooksgmailcom
IAmA,not_removed,i havent studied it although we did look at otto von bismarcks policies at university
IAmA,not_removed,yes i will do it on the world war i christmas truce
IAmA,not_removed,can you show me a clip of what you refer to i go to a lot of historical reenactments as you can see on the channel and am thinking of mixing in this footage with the videos
IAmA,not_removed,is this the battle that is connected to the discovery of coffee beans in the ottoman camp
IAmA,not_removed,i think one of the biggest problems people have when getting into learning history is that they are put off by information overload and technicalities as well as people who put them off because they know every thing about a subject my books for example give people are starting point and a grounding in the historical topic in a way a textbook and its sea of text and black and white grainy photos may not dont get me wrong though i would encourage more detailed focused books and videos once the viewer gets interested in a topic
IAmA,not_removed,yes i will
IAmA,not_removed,i love origin stories well weve made one about how lego started httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmvggwfwores so i was thinking of doing more of these on companies like apple google nintendo
IAmA,not_removed,cool whats your name i have the books going on but the video format is another way people can learn and i think while you both have the visual element there so were not just looking at a sea of text video is perhaps a quicker more accessible format the videos are short and keep you engaged if you dont have a lot of time theres also the possibility that they could work in some kind of elearning quiz game as cutscenes if you will i enjoy both in terms of creativity
IAmA,not_removed,i havent heard of this before
IAmA,not_removed,days to make a video if i could purely focus on what i love doing thats just a dream at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,a broad overview i want to make faction episodes on wwi
IAmA,not_removed,i see this is related to the war of which is something i really want to make into a book and video how would you envision an animated style video depiction of this topic
IAmA,not_removed,im sorry that you didnt find the videos entertaining
IAmA,not_removed,not sure who would you say
IAmA,not_removed,philippines overthrowing of ferdinand marcos thanks for the sub at the moment i appear to just be doing significant but lesser known niche events will be made into videos as the channel becomes more grounded because there often isnt much info on the topic on youtube which would annoy me if i was a student studying the topic
IAmA,not_removed,this one has been done
IAmA,not_removed,i really would like to learn more about your animating process do you think you could site some resources
IAmA,not_removed,ive just read this and i love shows like drunk history where they portray historical events ill be sure to watch
IAmA,not_removed,english civil war would be a good one did you study this i aim to have a catalogue of history subjects on the channel
IAmA,not_removed,almost everything in history what do you mean by that thats such an impossible amount of stuff that im curious what your intent is there also put two line breaks in between paragraphs to avoid the whole of your comment being a quote
IAmA,not_removed,you should try the paraguayan war as soon as you can if you havent already of the male paraguayan population dead and all its industry destroyed tough shit
IAmA,not_removed,in my opinion there is no better way to do that than to debunk what is arguably one fo the biggest threats to scientific endeavour that exists in modern times not to sound like a clickbait article or anything but this will absolutely blow your mind if i was to give another example thats similar it would be ancient alien theory which is something that spirit science actually use a lot themselves the rejection of established anthropolgical explainations in favour of claiming aliens built civilization and all this sort of thing
IAmA,not_removed,sweet that theater of the war gets overlooked far too often
IAmA,not_removed,uhwas that a yes i suppose she is an icon in history
IAmA,not_removed,perfect
IAmA,not_removed,the crusade of varna takes place right before the start date is literally the day after it ended
IAmA,not_removed,can we have the name of the book please
IAmA,not_removed,explain every story everywhere is inaccurate to a point or at least missing some data but you can get the gist right are you saying the west lost world war ii or we were the bad guys where do you get your history you imply the east gets it accurate north koreas dictator kim youngil had hole in ones is this true
IAmA,not_removed,not to mention filtering primary source bias through the authors of secondary sources which then passes through our own personal biases toss in some bias of choice to that mix and its impossible to accurately portray just about anything
IAmA,not_removed,i appreciate the answer have an upvote
IAmA,not_removed,it is a shit qustion it implies that all history taught in the west is inacurate which is obliviusly wrong and tries to crucify op for being from the west
IAmA,not_removed,which is generally true
IAmA,not_removed,for a few seconds what codec are using to render
IAmA,not_removed,hey friend even at hd your compression settings sound off if its a few seconds for a gig try using the codec instead of animation in afterfx before rendering the sequence also saving as qt quicktime file format instead of avi mov etc will be helpful and can still open on vlc quicktime windows media player youtube etc keep up the awesome work if you want help i love animation and compositing
IAmA,not_removed,follow up questions on this how much do you engage in the historiography then to gauge the impartial and factual nature of the sources that youre using do you go so far as to mine footnotes to find other sources à la an academic historian do you cite sources in the cartoons
IAmA,not_removed,do you know thealternate history channel i also kinda like his drawings idk xd
IAmA,not_removed,great idea ive sent to my middle school history teaching colleagues
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man im looking fwd to it
IAmA,not_removed,oh cool link to the book
IAmA,not_removed,do it like the monty python one of pearl harbor
IAmA,not_removed,i would really like the hun empire as there arent a lot of videos on them
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for answering theyre hilarious i just think every history buff should watch them
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwahctvcomtvshowsgreatesttankbattlesvideosgreatesttankbattlesbattleofthehellcats there is also the market in the online tank gaming such as world of tanks to sell to please dont make more mediocrity we have enough if you do go forward
IAmA,not_removed,its the one with alot of polish horsies
IAmA,not_removed,its ryan high school days its amazing how productive you are pretty inspiring do you have a day job too or is it all about the history now
IAmA,not_removed,yea i was thinking something like the rise and fall of the ottomans from when they came into power in the century to their fall after wwi but maybe thats too broad
IAmA,not_removed,i was thinking of the time when south carolina decided not to pay a tarriff in the and almost seceded didnt know about a nullification crisis in though
IAmA,not_removed,what resources do you mean i use flash and after fx in fact im animating as we speak
IAmA,not_removed,seen some of those
IAmA,not_removed,not op but currently does a dissertation on the english civil wars and i love that period of history channel looks great
IAmA,not_removed,around the same period makes for a good story starts off with httpsenwikipediaorgwikidefenestrationsofpraguethedefenestration and devolves into allout religious civil war involving all the main powers its also traditionally seen as the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwestphaliansovereignty
IAmA,not_removed,i have a book called history of the world in objects inspired by that i want to depict all the topics that people struggle to learn about and cover stuff from the prehistory to modern i wrote a bit ambitiously earlier p
IAmA,not_removed,didnt south park make fun out of this theory with the first thanksgiving back in colonial times xd and the fact that the history channel was playing episodes as if this was a reputable fact heres something to whet your appetite that we just released about the salem witch trials as you know many innocent people were hanged being accused of witchcraft
IAmA,not_removed,anyone who is interesting will certainly be considered for a video
IAmA,not_removed,yeh this would be interesting the icons of history get all the credit but people forget those around them like paul revere who had several other riders with him when people think he was the sole rider
IAmA,not_removed,simple history a guide to the roaring twenties and dirty thirties
IAmA,not_removed,i think you replied to the wrong person
IAmA,not_removed,thanks
IAmA,not_removed,i never implied anything just asking whether hell recount what hes been taught or do own independent research try asking a swedish middle aged guy what he had been taught in school about compare this to books from a nation that arent total pussies youd be shocked same goes for history books from many countries east and west being born behind the iron curtain but living years in the west i see some differences in teachings if you think that the history taught everywhere isnt inaccurate and shaped by the country you live in youre naive
IAmA,not_removed,red terror dont real
IAmA,not_removed,quicktime full
IAmA,not_removed,awesome
IAmA,not_removed,not sure if i can post the link ill take it down if its not
IAmA,not_removed,i have all the magazines they are an influence but i feel there is a lot of joking about some horrible things like people being killed in horrid ways
IAmA,not_removed,they seem to do the job pretty well
IAmA,not_removed,uhlans
IAmA,not_removed,nice to speak to you again yeh got a day job as well so this is something i jump onto after work
IAmA,not_removed,the sick man of europe
IAmA,not_removed,not in but a cause according to wiki many south carolina politicians blamed the change in fortunes on the national tariff policy that developed after the war of to promote american manufacturing over its european competition
IAmA,not_removed,can you make one about the democratic kkk
IAmA,not_removed,you should try when diplomacy fails he covers a lot of history on the build up and political backgrounds on how wars stars not just and and maybe napoleon but he digs into a lot of lesser known instances while still being very entertaining
IAmA,not_removed,new word learnt defenestration
IAmA,not_removed,well i dont know about that book but a lot of world history courses tend to completely ignore anything that happened in the americas the pacific and south saharan africa until the colonial age so i hope you cover those topics in your series
IAmA,not_removed,gotcha well i enjoyed the wwii video and look forward to your continued work and development as a channel good luck
IAmA,not_removed,theres a bbc podcast called the history of the world in a objects its quite interesting have you listened to it
IAmA,not_removed,have you heard the radio series a history of the world in objects it can be found at if you have a uk ipaddress and can probably be had otherways
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure but i hope so and it sounds like something theyd do ill have to have a look out for that looks like ive found my starting point for this sunday binge im inevitably going to commit to at some point thanks again i look forward to seeing more videos and hopefully not seeing a repeat of the events depicted in your reccomended video but aimed at the scientific community xd
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man keep making the awesome videos best of luck
IAmA,not_removed,something must be going wrong there what frame rate minute of x filmed video encoded with at maximum quality should be about animation should be way less because theres much less colour information to encode for example minute of x animation encoded with at maximum quality should be around
IAmA,not_removed,whoops just saw this are you using assets that are like x quality or something ive made entire minute sequences with whole moving matte paintings that were all over resolution using the same settings as you and it wasnt even gigs
IAmA,not_removed,winged hussars
IAmA,not_removed,defenestration is one of the best words
IAmA,not_removed,thanks subscribe and comment enjoy and learn about history
IAmA,not_removed,have you read got the dorling kingsley books i have one called history of the world in objects you might like it
IAmA,not_removed,i think someone else said about that on here i have to check it out
IAmA,not_removed,yeh actually i think youre right it is at the ceiling of ill have to check one of the after fx shots i did again still its alot had to compress the shot so that i could edit it in premiere with decent ram preview
IAmA,not_removed,i am using illustrator vectors with that continuously rasterize feature on every element
IAmA,not_removed,what were the wings for intimidation
IAmA,not_removed,kindersley
IAmA,not_removed,is not a codec designed for editing youll find you get much better performance for editing using something like the prores codec the files will be bigger though around per minute
IAmA,not_removed,oh wow that explains it seems like you have it together
IAmA,not_removed,i think to block out the horses ears from enemy guns or something probably for poland to feel relevant
IAmA,not_removed,prores codec thanks anything that speeds up video production is welcome
IAmA,not_removed,interesting
IAmA,not_removed,what movie that everyone loved did you hate and why is it boyhood and what movie everyone hated did you love and why is it the postman
IAmA,not_removed,this sucks literally every man in my family has been in a commercial aviation accident except for me great grandfather bush pilot in alaska crashed near fairbanks great uncle i believe he was the first person to ever survive a tail rotor failure during a commercial helicopter flight was also the pilot copilot and all passengers died i think grandfathers father fighter pilotcommercial pilot had a bird strike which caused a fire in one of the engines during takeoff i crashed one of the like actual flight simulators at the training center of a major airline once but that is as close as i have been to a real aviation accident
IAmA,not_removed,this didnt cause a crash but it was scary as hell i was on a flight from athens to la guardia in we had just had our dinner and they were about to dim the lights when the captain came over the loudspeaker saying something in greek and everyone started freaking out then he repeated the message in english apparently a terror group had made a bomb threat against our flight we made an emergency landing in madrid everyones cell phones were confiscated and we had to leave everything on the plane we stayed in madrid for what felt like hours we were all segregated to this weird section of the airport perhaps a hangar we all had to sit on the ground there was no food they found some sandwiches but people devoured and started hoarding them and we had to pass around a water bottle if we needed to use the toilet we were accompanied by two armed guards and not allowed to shut the door super awkward i dont know if we were ever compensated i think not but it scared the hell out of me even just getting back into the plane was traumatic until one of the flight attendants assured me that due to the extensive checks they did this was actually the safest plane in the sky it has definitely changed the way i think about flying now i cant fly without antianxiety meds though im doing better now sometimes i bring them but never use them
IAmA,not_removed,ive never been on a plane but i think the luggage would be the last thing on your mind
IAmA,not_removed,do you remember the flight number
IAmA,not_removed,lol yeah none of them have died though except the great grandfather one of his passengers was injured so he went to get help in the alaskan wilderness of course rescue showed up not long after he left he survived for days on his way to find help and eventually fell into a frozen pond and died of hypothermia i guess he had like marked down the number of days he had been out there so he ended up being the only person who died he was actually really famous back then there are books written about him and stuff
IAmA,not_removed,yeah and he had young children my grandmother is dead now but from what i remember her telling me i think her mother went insane after he died and left all the children alone in alaska they were very wealthy though so it turned out alright for most of them she ended up getting her inheritance stolen by my grandfather when they divorced though it is actually a long and crazy story but the end result is that she is now dead and he has a yacht
IAmA,not_removed,i have a strong suspicion as to why no one has responded
IAmA,not_removed,did you know that it is every americans right to keep and bare arms i have two myself
IAmA,not_removed,lmfao laughing my fucking arms off
IAmA,not_removed,theres voice to text if thats what youre getting at
IAmA,not_removed,hmm i wonder why
IAmA,not_removed,stop it
IAmA,not_removed,you still have to activate it lol

IAmA,not_removed,where do you suggest i post it to then i havent been able to find anyone also is there any way i could see the post after its been removed it took me a while to write those questions up and i would like to at least be able to print them out
IAmA,not_removed,im not really sure you might be able to ask in rphotography
IAmA,not_removed,i was on vacation did all the illegal commissions you get finance this vacation i kid what id want to know is at your branch did the manager have any clue as to what was going on
IAmA,not_removed,did you open extra accounts for customers who didnt request them
IAmA,not_removed,how far up do you believe the corruption was known
IAmA,not_removed,can you give us non yanks a clue on why your bank is in the news and why youre doing an ama
IAmA,not_removed,hi there we have a three month cooling off period between identical amas from the same ama author youre welcome to come back again in the future
IAmA,not_removed,lol no on the vacation and yes it was brought up many many times
IAmA,not_removed,no i was a straight shooter and it cost me promotions i did convince people to open shit they didnt need though and i feel bad about that but i wouldnt do stuff that would harm them
IAmA,not_removed,at least district manager level bare minimum
IAmA,not_removed,wells fargo had a high pressure sales environment where employees were encouraged to open spurious accounts often without the customers knowledge and its been a shit show above and beyond the norm
IAmA,not_removed,cool sorry

IAmA,not_removed,he has no offical social media accounts what can i do
IAmA,not_removed,if there is anything that you can find let us know
IAmA,not_removed,would also love to hear how shes doing
IAmA,not_removed,please upvote i have so many questions
IAmA,not_removed,we could get five or six of those people in here or just one
IAmA,not_removed,why is this weekend the busiest
IAmA,not_removed,whats the weirdest request a customer has made a weird thing they wanted moved
IAmA,not_removed,whats the worst thing that youve had to move
IAmA,not_removed,what was your absolute worst day on the job in detail please
IAmA,not_removed,tbh im not sure my company just told me this is our busiest weekend every year i think its because so many college aged kids are moving back to their campus although i havent moved any college aged people so far this weekend
IAmA,not_removed,nah i can take that out i just figured may as well throw in a shameless plug
IAmA,not_removed,i dont really have any super weird experiences surprisingly i went into the job expecting to sometimes see weird things when moving dressers and night stands because we take the drawers out to move them and i figured some people would forget to take out their condoms lube sex toys etc but surprisingly that hasnt happened yet people are well prepared for that i guess haha
IAmA,not_removed,nothing is honestly too heavy for me between my strength dolleys and lifting straps so thats not really a problem the worst things to move are big heavy objects up and down stairs especially when theres a turn in the middle customers dont like scratched walls so we have to go super slow in particular because im going backwards up the stairs is hard because the object will trap my feet between every single step and its super easy to trip and going down stairs forward is hard because i have to take really small steps to avoid hitting my shins on the corner of the object
IAmA,not_removed,its not even august yet so that explanation cant be right every college whose calendar ive seen admittedly not hundreds but a handful starts a couple weeks later than now
IAmA,not_removed,i went on a private tour of one for my classes once so i can help answer some of these the particular one i went to was completely automated the employees there were mostly to transport recycling and maintain the sorting machines as for cleaning i cant really help you there not sure about what more people should do they didnt bring it up but they really emphasized how bad it is when people bag their recycling because the bags jam the conveyors and machines constantly and it can be time consuming to fix and for nonrecyclable waste usually a shitload
IAmA,not_removed,i dont do this but my mom does its pretty much all actual people work stuff gets tossed on the conveyer and people have different stations to sort stuff out one person might be on newspapers one on bottles etc main complaints seem to be stop putting dead animals in recycling bags and start putting your needles in actual sharps containers they just had someone get jabbed and now she has to do like months to a year of tests and drugs
IAmA,not_removed,if both of the above things are true arent you missing an opportunity to call yourself a pro boneo attorney
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to be part of an organization that denies science on gm technology while you are crying about politicians denying science on climate change
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt tillerson support a carbon tax
IAmA,not_removed,what are your thoughts on elon musk supporting rex
IAmA,not_removed,did you make eye contact with him
IAmA,not_removed,im not a lawyer what does one actually do as a pro bono lawyer in this case what is the actual work that needs done was it necessary to do it in the airport or was it just a convenient rallying spot edit i hope this isnt coming off as sarcasm i really am curious
IAmA,not_removed,when is greenpeace going to stop throwing stink bombs and actually stop japanese whaling boats
IAmA,not_removed,what do you do day to day in your job as an attorney
IAmA,not_removed,why greenpeace
IAmA,not_removed,are you one of those people who in a conversation doesnt listen but just waits to talk about how awesome you are
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know who you are but are you going to answer questions that criticize you or just the people who arent
IAmA,not_removed,who would make a better chief diplomat than rex t
IAmA,not_removed,what was your reasoning for going after rubio given hes not up for reelection do you see him as a republican ally during the trump years if so why attack him if not whats your strategy to rally more republicans to your cause
IAmA,not_removed,i have been seeing lots of comments about how president obama passed a nearly identical executive order on immigration in is this true if not how are the executive orders from trump and obama different and what makes trumps version illegal
IAmA,not_removed,you must have a lot of spare time
IAmA,not_removed,two quick question do you think harassment is appropriate for someone voting how they think is correct he voted for trump kick his ass etc other than election day do you think youre heard or given any credence
IAmA,not_removed,how does someone with so much education not find carrying around a spine demeaning could you not have found a better use of your time considering you have a law degree and why not just have an intern hold the spine
IAmA,not_removed,do you think the benefits of carrying that spine outweigh the drawbacks ie making democrats look like a party of spoiled children
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for being so candid with your political opinions putting yourself out there like this is tough and i respect what youre doing ive read through your responses and i have to say i havent seen any valid reasons to oppose rex as secretary of state can you please elaborate full disclosure i support him and think hell do a fantastic job also as a side question that you dont have to answer whats your opinion on fracking
IAmA,not_removed,why a spine
IAmA,not_removed,did anyone else see greenpeace racist and then spend minutes trying to figure that one out no just me there is no a or c in resist but there is an eye two of which i clearly did not use
IAmA,not_removed,given tillerson is nominated for secretary of state not directly related to energyenvironmental policy could you specifically identify why youre so strongly opposed to his appointment
IAmA,not_removed,are you going to now start following him around with a pair of truck nuts
IAmA,not_removed,also the senate is about to hold a debate on confirming rex tillerson senate democrats are trying to hold it up call your senators and tell them to reject rex
IAmA,not_removed,whats wrong with you
IAmA,not_removed,i have a question why are you so disgustingly desperate for attention
IAmA,not_removed,whos financing your life while youre wasting time as a social justice warriorthe same people who paid for the law degree you arent using
IAmA,not_removed,do you think mentioning that you work with greenpeace lost you all credibility with this ama audience or was it just your posturing and ineffectiveness as a legal professional
IAmA,not_removed,remember when people used activism because they wanted change instead of internet karma
IAmA,not_removed,so you didnt accomplish anything with your stunt in dc are you proud of it do you know rex tillerson has he been convicted of any crime that would disqualify him from being secstate did you cry when your candidate lost the election oh and no i have no respect for your stunts and posturing
IAmA,not_removed,why is rex tillerson bad for the planet
IAmA,not_removed,did you defend any iraqis when obama banned them from travelling to the us in
IAmA,not_removed,how much do you get paid by george soros
IAmA,not_removed,is there anything trump would do or choose for his administration that you would support
IAmA,not_removed,how is the virtue signaling going
IAmA,not_removed,was it really as chaotic as they say
IAmA,not_removed,that was expert level real life trolling cheers to you can you follow paul ryan next
IAmA,not_removed,is this what white people do during their free time
IAmA,not_removed,do you believe this method of conveying your message is the best way or do you believe alienating and dividing parties further instead of attempting to reach across party lines is essentially a waste of time
IAmA,not_removed,i just have to ask what are the specific objectives of greenpeace that you support if you are aware of the controversy around them or some of their beliefs that are unpopular with other environmental groups do you feel that your message might be hindered by association with them or do you feel that association with greenpeace is a necessary component for your message versus simply acting as an independent environmentalist
IAmA,not_removed,what are you actually hoping to achieve as far as i can tell its just time wasted until a court strikes down the decision
IAmA,not_removed,do you think you have garnered enough attention by now or will you continue for a while longer what is your opinion about attention whoring creeping up the ages years ago it used to be only teenagers but nowadays we see people old enough to have finished law school crawing for attention online
IAmA,not_removed,why do you hate capitalism
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to still have trump as your president after all this whining and complaining
IAmA,not_removed,can you tell me in full detail why you think rex tillerson is not fit for the job who would you rather fill it with cinderella
IAmA,not_removed,how can you support a terrorist organization like greenpeace
IAmA,not_removed,you mentioned that the cbp officers were in violation of the court order did they receive instructions or guidelines from dhs or from whoever is at the top of the pyramid to comply or not comply or is this down to individual officers
IAmA,not_removed,what is your education background and what led you to take action
IAmA,not_removed,how many whales have you help save in the wild also how much of the money that greenpeace takes in goes directly to whales
IAmA,not_removed,attention hungry
IAmA,not_removed,what was the best response youve gotten from your spine trolling
IAmA,not_removed,also what was the airport like last night
IAmA,not_removed,in your opinion how effective is a viral photovideo in bringing about actual change my worry is that this was a buzzfeed laugh of the day and no more but my hope is that marco rubio is stewing and plotting for the day when he will rise up and say lets dispel with this fiction that marco rubio doesnt have a backbone
IAmA,not_removed,does anyone want a quick summary of the ops answers here it is reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a job
IAmA,not_removed,whats it like being so hysterical
IAmA,not_removed,serious question why didnt you do this at the airport when obama put a very similar travel ban in place
IAmA,not_removed,do any of your friends or family members find you to be obnoxious
IAmA,not_removed,whos spine is it
IAmA,not_removed,i heard that the solicitors at airports are only able to find out about detainees being held from their relatives waiting for them and wondering why they havent appeared in arrivals once a solicitor becomes aware of a detainee how can they make contact with a detainee mindful the detainee has no idea the solicitor is trying to help them so cannot be requesting them
IAmA,not_removed,how were you able to get so close to rubio did security give you a hard time when you tried to bring a fake spine in the building
IAmA,not_removed,why did you support hillary clinton as sos back in the day she was a horrible sos
IAmA,not_removed,could the judge have sent in the us marshals to enforce the court order if it had come to that
IAmA,not_removed,so is she going to answer any of these questions
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel knowing that you came out for trumps executive order yet ignored the people when obama signed similar orders where you there for them
IAmA,not_removed,did sen rubio interact with you a lot if so what was he like
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to refer to buzzfeed as the news
IAmA,not_removed,what can i do to help
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a real job or a life
IAmA,not_removed,question regarding the situation at hand even though its obvious you arent a supporter of trumps pick for secretary of state if you had the chance to replace the nominee with someone else who would you replace it with and why
IAmA,not_removed,support your work questions how far do you think the us will go in ignoring international treaties in the coming years can visitors still trust therell be a rule of law are you afraid this ama might be hijacked by all the extreme right groups here on reddit
IAmA,not_removed,for those who are unaware what are some things redditors can do to help their cause regarding trumps executive order
IAmA,not_removed,wow huge fan two questions if you had to go on a date with a sitting republican member of either the house or senate who would you choose would you rather fight duck sized horses or horse sized duck
IAmA,not_removed,whats more effective right now callsemails or trolling also does marco know hes a lapdog for a petty tyrant with a size complex
IAmA,not_removed,any comments on that story about green peace people taking pets off front porches or the two activists that forcibly took a dog off a homeless person in france or destroying the nazca lines for a publicity stunt
IAmA,not_removed,just wanted to say youre my hero how are you doing
IAmA,not_removed,hey there fellow greenpeacer loved the nvda you have some gut and a spine my question is how did you think of it
IAmA,not_removed,your username and from all the comments you keep posting you constantly refer to spine do you have a spine fetish also you need to work on your sign skills
IAmA,not_removed,i supported senator rubio during the republican race because i felt like he was a breath of fresh air or as close as the gop would get i supported him when he attacked trump during the race and was devastated when he caved later when i saw him grill tillerson i saw a flash of why i supported him but then it was lost again how was he responded to you if at all
IAmA,not_removed,given the current state of affairs on earth would you say we are getting closer to fulfilling the plot depicted in the matt damon film elysium
IAmA,not_removed,how much does soros pay you

IAmA,not_removed,what is your real name are you volunteering with green peace or are you a paid employee are your friends and family supportive of you or do they think youre a looney whats the most difficult aspect of your job volunteering
IAmA,not_removed,whyd you choose to follow rubio you must have known he had no chance

IAmA,not_removed,questions if the cbp defys constitutional law as a whole what do you think the best solution is would a civilian militia ever be a answerfear what is the reprocussions for cbp longterm
IAmA,not_removed,im about to finish paralegal school i am hugely passionate about human and legal rights but am not sure how to apply this to my career what do you suggest would i have to go to law school
IAmA,not_removed,have you heard anything about how the detainees at airports are being treated ive heard stories of denial of legal representation confiscation of mobile phones declaration of all their social media accounts and preferred websites
IAmA,not_removed,are you jewish
IAmA,not_removed,what did you do when obama banned refugees from iraq and repealed wet footdry foot for cubans or is it only bad when a republican does something
IAmA,not_removed,are you mad that you were not affective
IAmA,not_removed,would you prefer we focus our questions on rampart
IAmA,not_removed,what is wrong with you
IAmA,not_removed,on a scale of how fucked are we in the next four years
IAmA,not_removed,how much does your emotional state depend on you getting attention
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the bit of humor in a seemingly bleak congress if rubio isnt up for reelection in the near future why did he fold on his resounding and determined condemnation of rex doesnt that play moreso into drumpfs sp name calling him as little marc he always builds up my confidence albeit minuscule of any sort of moral compass with congressional repubs then fails to deliver
IAmA,not_removed,do you realize that youre a joke or are you not in on it it is easy to poke holes in peoples solutions but until you are in the seat and have to make some decisions of your own fuck off
IAmA,not_removed,can we have checks and balances back who do we have to sue for that
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your service can you please explain to my why the federal marshals have not been called in to enforce the federal court order cbp is defying
IAmA,not_removed,what the hell why isnt this top comment reddit lets me down sometimes edit what the hell dudes i wrote this when it wasnt why the down votes reddit lets me down sometimes
IAmA,not_removed,i am also a lawyer and i would also like an answer to this i would be happy to provide pro bono services but i have never practiced immigration law and i am fairly confident i would do more harm than good
IAmA,not_removed,im a lawyer that does have some roughly months immigration experience and based on that experience if youre an ableminded person with the ability to navigate the uscis webpage a supervising attorney should be able to direct you to start drafting waivers and appeals the main point of the attorneys being there i think was to protect the immigrants who are scared confused and typically not the best english speakers from listening to what may have been unlawful instructions given by the authorities at the airport
IAmA,not_removed,surely the lawyers there with experience will be able to teach those with less specific experience surely there will be lots of leg work to be done that requires lawyers but not necessarily immigration law experience
IAmA,not_removed,so much this i know of several law school classmates who ran to airports to help help with what exactly yall dont have any experience with this stuff and you cannot speak the language of your clients potentially we just graduated five minutes ago let the actual immigration attorneys handle this
IAmA,not_removed,non shes there to hold a sign real lawyers are researching precedent and constitutionality of the suspension and trying to craft arguments that may help people she wants fake internet points
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget nuclear if greenpeace supported it from founding we would have far fewer coal plants today and global warming would be nowhere near as advanced
IAmA,not_removed,we know op isnt going to answer questions like this
IAmA,not_removed,since op clearly doesnt plan to answer i am someone who works for a different environmental organization that denies the science behind gm technology environment america at the end of the day of the causes we actually work on are unrelated to gmos and i have never seen us actually work on a gmo oriented campaign however we do work on many very important environmental causes like preventing climate change protecting clean water sources and saving the dwindling bee population only a few people at the top get to pick the stances of the organization but i can contribute much more to the causes i care about by using the organizational strength of this group even if the stated position is that they disagree with me on a few issues that they tend not to act on though of the or so people ive met who have worked at various levels in my organization i have yet to find someone who is actually against gmos
IAmA,not_removed,this ama is a joke only answer what you want ama
IAmA,not_removed,wow he didnt answer shocking
IAmA,not_removed,this girl has answered questions with negative scores yet refused to answer any questions that challenge his stance edit gender
IAmA,not_removed,me after waiting for an answer httpmimgurcomakisus
IAmA,not_removed,urubiospinebearer op pls
IAmA,not_removed,this needs to be the top comment
IAmA,not_removed,rekt morons on both side of the spectrum rightists deny climate change and leftists protest nuclear energy
IAmA,not_removed,common guys get this comment tot he top force her to answer
IAmA,not_removed,savage
IAmA,not_removed,im not with greenpeace on the matter of gmo technology or nuclear power theyre both misunderstood but useful technologies but in the grand scheme of things the harm from climate change is such a big threat maybe its a good idea to let this slide and enjoy the helping push even if its not perfectly aimed edit added aside for clarification
IAmA,not_removed,awesome loaded question lol
IAmA,not_removed,tillerson also was president of the boy scouts of america for a few years and apparently was instrumental in allowing openly gray gay scouts into the program
IAmA,not_removed,bury this man answer only softballs ie op has no spine
IAmA,not_removed,ill answer this seriously yes from a public facing stance however its likely this is so he can set it much lower than or should be
IAmA,not_removed,id rather he didnt im more concerned with us senators supporting rex though elon musk is looking out for elon musk us senators are supposed to be looking out for the country
IAmA,not_removed,he made eye contact with me and with the spine
IAmA,not_removed,mostly fill out paperwork that is pretty confusing to probably half or more of native english speakers for people that may or may not be native english speakers also it had to be at the airport because thats where the people are they arent allowed to enter the country at the moment so theyre stuck at the airport until the ban is lifted or they get a plane ticket somewhere else
IAmA,not_removed,customs and border patrol is refusing to allow attorneys to speak with detainees in violation of the court order
IAmA,not_removed,i thought that was sea shepherd
IAmA,not_removed,i have a law degree but i am a campaigner here with a broad portfolio of responsibilities sometimes its holding a spine behind a senator who needs one sometimes its analyzing policy
IAmA,not_removed,this ama is a joke its not ask me anything its ask me anything about the publicity stunt i just pulled but only with positive connotations
IAmA,not_removed,nah op has no spine
IAmA,not_removed,a trex
IAmA,not_removed,the plastic spine i held up
IAmA,not_removed,rubio is avoiding the public eye as much as he can and not taking questions making him look very weak being from florida the state first to feel climate change would make you think hed care but hes trying to not make any noise while following the party line
IAmA,not_removed,i have been seeing lots of comments about how president obama passed a nearly identical executive order on immigration in trump trolls here are some links
IAmA,not_removed,its not really similar obama didnt ban travel he just froze the iraqi refugee program for months after the fbi discovered legitimate terrorists that had used it to enter the us green cards were still honored unlike trumps order and it applied to one country in response to an actual incident
IAmA,not_removed,she definitely does paid for by soros probably
IAmA,not_removed,when did he advocate violence he was taking a political stance with a prop politics is not for the thin skinned
IAmA,not_removed,rofl she wont answer the good ones this ama is a joke
IAmA,not_removed,i havent seen any valid reasons to oppose rex as secretary of state can you please elaborate the big ones are his close ties to russia and his history with climate change while ceo of exxon exxon spread misinformation about climate change while tillerson was the ceo when asked about this he said exxon would have to answer that when asked if he didnt know about exxons policy of undermining climate change science or he didnt want to answer he said a little bit of both it demonstrates a lack of integrity as he put profit before a serious issue
IAmA,not_removed,amongst other things when russia invaded crimea a few years ago one of the many effects of the us sanctions was the killing of a deal between russian business and exxonmobil the deal was worth thats five hundred billion dollars a staggering amount of money now the guy going for they job where he could feasibly do away with these sanctions is the ex ceo of exxonmobil i think half a trillion dollars might be a motivating factor this is clearly a conflict of interest sure the doesnt go directly to him but it doesnt take a genius to see that he would personally benefit perhaps he is an upstanding and principled man whod never dream of doing such a thing but his senate confirmation hearing left lots to be desired with regards to tillerson giving straight answers about russia and the sanctions etc flip it around if hillary was nominating someone like the financial manager of the clinton foundation to secretary of state the republicans would be going nuts tillerson is an arguably worse choice and its not like there arent plenty of good republican diplomats sitting around tillerson is an obvious attempt to bypass the republican and political establishment which is not in itself a bad idea but choosing an oil barron with conflicts of interest and zero experience in the rest of world politics outside of russia seems shaky for the heaviest hitting diplomatic job in the country choose an outsider if you want but choose an outsider who is above reproach tillerson is not a wise choice
IAmA,not_removed,itt op only answering liberal questions and completely avoiding anything of substance from conservatives
IAmA,not_removed,senator rubio gave the indication he might have one and stand up to trump when he put some hard questions to rex tillerson during his confirmation hearing including asking him about war crimes in syria which tillerson didnt really answer seemed pretty damning rubio seemed like he might even vote against tillerson defying trump but then rubios fossil fuel industry donors gave him his marching orders and told him to support tillerson which he did pretty spineless so we brought him one
IAmA,not_removed,because marcos missing his
IAmA,not_removed,soros
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,im going to guess the answer if you ever get one will be a flowery worded sentence that boils down to i dont like him therefore no one should like him
IAmA,not_removed,my senator is rubiodo you think i should call
IAmA,not_removed,called my senator told him to confirm rex the man played senate democrats like a fool during their little hearing refused to give them an inch kept ice cold throughout
IAmA,not_removed,if you are going to call for action can you actually give us some information about why rex isnt the right man to fill the position
IAmA,not_removed,why seems like the most capable person willing to do the job
IAmA,not_removed,sorry but i think rex is a great choice for the position
IAmA,not_removed,nah
IAmA,not_removed,httpswwwmcsweeneysnetarticlestheperksofbeingaprofessionalprotester george soros also helping immigrants pro bono does seem to be using it
IAmA,not_removed,boom roasted
IAmA,not_removed,people are ironically good people nowadays what a world
IAmA,not_removed,agreed
IAmA,not_removed,rex tillerson spent his entire career at exxonmobil his job was to find extract and burn carbon which as everyone but this administration knows causes climate change which is really bad for the planet thats the short answer there are many more reasons ask away
IAmA,not_removed,it sounds like op is the one who needs a spine judging buy all the questions he dodged ama as long as its easy to answer and fits my agenda
IAmA,not_removed,he did not they needed visas from the us government because their countries werent thought to be stable enough to correctly vet them
IAmA,not_removed,tldr there was no ban there was a stricter vetting policy that slowed refugee admissions that year
IAmA,not_removed,i was just about to ask this
IAmA,not_removed,considering other comments alluding to her familys wealth im of the opinion that shes just been brainwashed by the zionists and is not a paid protestor
IAmA,not_removed,i imagine a murder suicide between himself and mike pence would get her panties wet
IAmA,not_removed,well tillerson is going to be secstate and trumps eo still stands soabout as expected
IAmA,not_removed,left is going full retard easiest consolidation of power ever
IAmA,not_removed,by last evening things werent chaotic because lawyers werent allowed to see detainees and cbp still refused to speak to us or the elected officials that came to the airport not much lawyers could do while cbp is still violating the court order and information on those detained and deported is not yet available we are working our hardest to get that information
IAmA,not_removed,funny how when one side dominates they ask why the other doesnt reach across party lines
IAmA,not_removed,is this written in poetic verse
IAmA,not_removed,fuck you shes fighting the real fight back home go back to your little island of racism bigotry sexism xenophobia and climate change denial
IAmA,not_removed,has to be this which arrived in the mail
IAmA,not_removed,answered in another thread by last evening things werent chaotic because lawyers werent allowed to see detainees and cbp still refused to speak to us or the elected officials that came to the airport not lawyers could do while cbp is still violating the court order and information on those detained and deported is not yet available we are working our hardest to get that information
IAmA,not_removed,us too trolling is fun but i think you effectively answered your question rest assured carrying a spine around is not all were doing
IAmA,not_removed,a soros funded spoiled brat whos trying to be edgy its adorable
IAmA,not_removed,obamas temporary travel ban was against specific iraqis maybe afghani too cant remember off the top of my head that assisted with the american war effort in the middle east his reason was that an ied used against us forces was found to have fingerprints of two iraqi translators living in kentucky that were granted a us visa because they assisted our military in iraq upon learning we had traitors involved with that program obama put a stop to it temporarily to ensure there werent more this is very different than a blanket ban on all people from certain countries
IAmA,not_removed,oh fucking please
IAmA,not_removed,about as effectively as her legal defense is
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for asking you should resist in the way that feels right to you on tillerson i would say call your senators and tell them to vote no on policieslawsaction that you object to call your senators and your congressman and explain that you oppose it in general you can get involved in your community on almost any issue important to you environmental justice racial justice immigration fracking money in politics etc heres a great way to plug in httpsgreenwiregreenpeaceorgusaen
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the support i dont think we know the answer to that yet its been days and there have been some unprecedented dangerous and illegal actions already someone already asked me how much soros paid me so
IAmA,not_removed,call your senators and representatives right now capitol switchboard demand that they repeal the ban demand that they publicly oppose the ban tell them to hold up every cabinet nominee vote until its revoked and then tell them to get the names of people who were detained and deported so the lawyers can help them
IAmA,not_removed,the capitol police who saw it go through the xray at the entrance asked me the same thing im going to say to you the same thing i said to them where would i get a real human spine s its plastic but very lifelike
IAmA,not_removed,whoever speaks up first to either a reject rex or b overturn this executive order on immigration so im probably safe getting this one out of the way early im pretty short so duck sized horses i might have a chance
IAmA,not_removed,trolling was certainly the most effective for my soul so i would never discourage it that said call or inperson visit is worth about emails so keep calling staff has to report it to their boss and if their bosses dont listen you vote them out next election
IAmA,not_removed,thanks anyone with a spine can be a hero these days the first days of this administration have been tough but im hanging in there this is a good place to work right now
IAmA,not_removed,thank you it was not the worst reason to work late i dont think we were the first ones to call rubio or any of the gop senators spineless but we did have a spine and proximity to the hill so
IAmA,not_removed,edit he said ama im a woman in the spirit of dialogue with our critics let me answer this just to be clear george soros doesnt pay me our incredibly dedicated and generous supporters do now i volunteered at the airport last night a weekend on my own time not paid at all not for my job it is my job to hold government accountable for decisions that i think will harm people and the planet but i would have done it for free
IAmA,not_removed,if you had ever earned a salary at an independent non profit you would understand that people are not in it for the money sadly paid below market trolls need facts too
IAmA,not_removed,aw sad troll has a sad edit dude she said she works for greenpeace you can look up their funders online you can apply for jobs and learn about salaries you dont have a question you have dated talking points
IAmA,not_removed,thats a popular question around here we heard someone edited the invertebrates wikipedia page to include paul ryan rightly so allegedly protestors also brought spines to senator schumers apartment so if your version of resisting is bringing spines to gop politicians go for it
IAmA,not_removed,i think were looking at the day after tomorrow considering its climate change
IAmA,not_removed,if youre not going to constructively contribute to this ama you might as well do something better with your time
IAmA,not_removed,what does that have to do with anything
IAmA,not_removed,did you spell it that way in reference to the spine thing
IAmA,not_removed,fitting everyone with cumberbunds isnt the worst way to spend time
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,because the crowd is fickle and can be whipped into a lynching
IAmA,not_removed,dont take it personally i downvote every this comment should be le top comment comment
IAmA,not_removed,it is
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,shes keeping the immigrants from signing away their given rights to pressuring government personnel
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget that coal ash contains uranium and thorium which are just dumped into the air meaning that its more radioactive miles from a coal plant than it is the same distance from a nuclear one
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget nuclear if greenpeace supported it from founding we would have far fewer coal plants today and global warming would be nowhere near as advanced thes too much hypocritical and science denying stuff going on in greenpeace that i cant be bothered anymore but i just had this weird urge to ask something when i saw her standing on the moral high ground with greenpeace sign proudly in the picture
IAmA,not_removed,gmos can help to fight against global warming as well iirc rice fields are huge methane emitter while we already have gm rice producing way less methane
IAmA,not_removed,also rex tillerson believes in climate change there are a lot of bad nominees but hes not really one of them
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know anything about this issue but to be fair it wasnt really a question
IAmA,not_removed,its ask me anything not aye my answers
IAmA,not_removed,maybe she should use that spine she brings with her everywhere to face her contradictions
IAmA,not_removed,wrong gender
IAmA,not_removed,but nuclear power helps to combat climate change and its economical so much easier to get support for it from rightwing folks
IAmA,not_removed,openly gray scouts into the program
IAmA,not_removed,why didnt you answer the first question just curious really
IAmA,not_removed,supposed to be that hasnt happened in decades
IAmA,not_removed,cool what does the paperwork entail
IAmA,not_removed,so as a nonpracticing attorney what would you have said to the detainees had you been allowed to speak to them
IAmA,not_removed,the court order from the district in ny that technically doesnt have any authority in the completely different district in va where dulles is located
IAmA,not_removed,it is greenpeace are none violent
IAmA,not_removed,how exactly would you help detainees then not knowing the law in that regard not being a practicing attorney also limits what you can do for them also it aint a secret greenpeace has had a sketchy history not afraid of that devaluing your efforts
IAmA,not_removed,so unemployed
IAmA,not_removed,what do you do day to day in your job as an attorney i am a campaigner here with a broad portfolio of responsibilities
IAmA,not_removed,its a joke on both sides though amas by dbags like this guy would go over much better if they just stuck to the piercing questions and didnt have to resort to ad hominem the guy is a douche for sure but that should he evidenced by his lack of answering real questions
IAmA,not_removed,im not shocked that you dont have a real answer
IAmA,not_removed,to shreds you say
IAmA,not_removed,hahahaha good one sosoros clinton again just being destructive without providing solutions come on just name your oligarch cause fuck em all the way this gets fixed is not clamoring to one manufactured side or another but with strong leadership ousting the entrenched oligarch system thats fucking us
IAmA,not_removed,no real answer shocking
IAmA,not_removed,sounds pretty similar to me
IAmA,not_removed,i believe trumps order was intended to honor green card holders there was just a lot of poorly carried out orders and a lot of confusion correct me if im wrong though
IAmA,not_removed,who the fuck is soros and why does reddit keep telling me hes the bogeyman
IAmA,not_removed,httpswwwmcsweeneysnetarticlestheperksofbeingaprofessionalprotester
IAmA,not_removed,he didnt have to for it to be my question im primarily concerned about it so i asked his opinion
IAmA,not_removed,ties to russia cool start cold war ii already cause itll be hilarious when russians say wut since this rhetoric is completely one sided why is russia an enemy first it was china now its russia us needs to be the only superpower and if it cant be itll break its toys and leave god forbid we work with other nations too much compassion and cooperation might actually kill us
IAmA,not_removed,it isnt even a republican question its why you do what you do
IAmA,not_removed,do you have a spine because in this thread you seem to be nothing more than a greenpeace puppet ignoring all the questions that dont fit your own agenda
IAmA,not_removed,so youre saying senator rubio who was the only republican who actually asked hard questions indicating he wasnt just rolling over for the sake of politics and party loyalty is spineless because he chose not to vote the way you wanted that seems like a pretty juvenile response coming from an educated professional
IAmA,not_removed,username really checks out
IAmA,not_removed,she is an attorney paid by greenpeace
IAmA,not_removed,i dont like trump therefore no one should like his nominees ftfy
IAmA,not_removed,one of your senators isnt marco rubio
IAmA,not_removed,my senator is ted cruz should we cry together
IAmA,not_removed,you should especially call your senator if hes a jerk like rubio flood his phone lines and make him issue a stupid statement like that one from colorado did worst case scenario it does nothing and you wasted minutes best case pressure from my constituents gives him cover for blocking some of the crap thats going on call bill nelson and make sure hes standing in opposition with the rest of the dems too
IAmA,not_removed,show up at his town halls ask tough questions use every oppportunity to publicly shame him
IAmA,not_removed,yea man it might not change their mind but itll annoy the shit out of his aides and flood his phone lines so his donors wont be able to call him while youre at it call his donors too and bitch them out
IAmA,not_removed,me too i was seriously shocked at how impressive he was in the confirmation hearings i think hes perfect for the job
IAmA,not_removed,i agree i wasnt sure what to think before the hearing and he was a star guy is stepping away from the helm of a multimillion dollar company to do public service this is what the founding fathers had in mind the best and the brightest taking time from real jobs to volunteer their time and talents
IAmA,not_removed,agreed why should i reject rex is it because that is catchy ok
IAmA,not_removed,massive conflict of interest
IAmA,not_removed,why not
IAmA,not_removed,thats a pretty weak reason you should think of a better argument in my opinion alternative forms of energy were not feasible for nearly the entire time rex was ceo most forms still are not electric cars are still on early on oil has helped push civilization to where it is today and us to a point where we can become more energy efficient
IAmA,not_removed,if you are viewing this message it is because the original comment was overridden with a greasemonkey overwrite script everyone has reasons of their own for deciding to leave reddit and here is mine i initially joined reddit in the summer of and have cycled through many accounts since i have always been a very active user and enjoyed reddit because it gave me an opportunity to learn about people cultures news science music animals etc from all over the world reddit was much smaller than it is today and more community oriented arguments existed but the community pushed for users to be objective and cordial over the past few years reddit has been slowly overcome with scum i dont just mean people with opinions different than my own i mean actual scum vitriolic racists and misogynists nazis pedophiles criminals facists government cronies and people who are just angry and hateful in general i found that i was increasingly arguing with people and trying to get them to see my perspective but this never worked because its difficult to fight hate and ignorance with logic i only ended up becoming bitter and hateful myself i have realized this is no way to live my life i initially tried to migrate to smaller subreddits in hopes of finding the sense of community that initially attracted me to reddit but these subreddits too have been filled with fighting words and endless arguing and unneccessary hate i fear reddit will never be what it once was i dont necessarily advocate for censorship because i do believe strongly in the right of humans to have free speech but unfortunately allowing hateful messages to spread on reddit under the guise of free speech will only push away positivity and attract negativity i hope to whoever reads this that you will consider advocating for peace and compassion on reddit a practice i myself have failed many times to implement if you too wish to install this script go to the greasemonkey website and install the reddit overwrite and reddit overwrite extended scripts
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever use a mode of transportation that burns fossil fuels planes hybrid cars etc and if so why
IAmA,not_removed,so are you saying that he would drill hydrocarbons and just burn them when they were out of the ground cause thats what your sentence looks like do you also realize that natural gas is probably the most feasible switch from coal usa could make to reduce its emissions
IAmA,not_removed,i think it is bad for the planet but to claim it is the only cause for climage change really glad you leftist types stopped calling it global warming although the name change is the closest we will ever get to you all admitting you were wrong and fools is a bit of a stretch there is more work to be done research cannot be halted the flag cannot put in the ground and declared the finish line
IAmA,not_removed,how the hell are you a lawyer with that kind of reasoning our world is doomed not because of rex but because law degrees are handed out like candy now apparently
IAmA,not_removed,ask away why you wont answer anything that doesnt suit your agenda thats not how this works you poor thing
IAmA,not_removed,this is a weak point you are making there the companies just do what the governments allow them to
IAmA,not_removed,she made eye contact with my question looked confused then mildly alarmed
IAmA,not_removed,hahahaha good one
IAmA,not_removed,yeah its not like they werent allowed to get in because of a ban they werent allowed to get in because of a beauracratic network that was made impotent completely different one is upfront the other is shady gives people hope and then fucks them oh and the wars bushclinton started they hired locals for different jobs promised them visas and after those people risked their lives and faced certain death for working with americans they fucked off for years being denied until they conveniently died id say the whole system is fucked and no one has your back but once you read into it anything fast hoovers fbi has bush sr and his arkansas buddy billy right in the mix state sanctioned planned in early for us imperialism bush sr took office an official detailed plan to knock over resisting oilcreating countries iraq libya syria iran and throw in afghanistan in there and plans for keeping russia weak and plundered and plans to deal with rising china
IAmA,not_removed,can these cbp officers be arrested if yes why havent any been arrested
IAmA,not_removed,years of stonewalls and now its time to work together for the good of the country
IAmA,not_removed,jesus christ if you think the real fight is back home you need to open up your eyes weve been at war for over a decade now to the tens of thousands of soldiers overseas that volunteered to be on the front lines of war every time they kill an isis terrorist tell them they are they not reeeeeally fighting but by all means go back to your protests where youre really at war
IAmA,not_removed,not another thread
IAmA,not_removed,hmm
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for the thoughtful reply ill definitely be more active locally thank you for the link protesting and leaving messages has been my whole month and im not ready to give up any time soon
IAmA,not_removed,trolls but doesnt like being trolled
IAmA,not_removed,given that you are a manlet would you be offended if i followed you around for a day with two average sized humerus bones
IAmA,not_removed,our incredibly dedicated and generous supporters do so george soros
IAmA,not_removed,yeah follow ryan around speaker of cowards
IAmA,not_removed,nothing probably just a coincidence
IAmA,not_removed,lynch him he called us fickle
IAmA,not_removed,coal is not radioactive what the hell are you talking about
IAmA,not_removed,wait seriously now this is something i did not know is there a good resource someone might have about the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear over coal and even over other sources such as geothermal and wind
IAmA,not_removed,greenpeace is denying science i dont know much about them could you provide sources
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know anything about this issue but to be fair it wasnt really a question i clearly asked how does it feel to walk around with a spine while being a part of spineless organization
IAmA,not_removed,you mean aye no answer
IAmA,not_removed,i was looking at this picture and i thought it was the young guy that was holding the spine i didnt look at all of the pictures
IAmA,not_removed,in his defense the first picture on the first link looks like the guy is holding the spine
IAmA,not_removed,yes im in favor of more nuclear power for exactly the reasons you say although the capital costs are a bit high ive clarified my parent comment please spare your scorn the good news is that operating expenses for nuclear power plants are somewhat lower than for fossil fuels i didnt know that before i looked it up just now
IAmA,not_removed,god hates grays
IAmA,not_removed,underrated comment i lold
IAmA,not_removed,he looked confused and then mildly alarmed
IAmA,not_removed,paper work fine print legalese
IAmA,not_removed,correct those differences being for the curious office of border patrol is a part of customs and border protection the people working in ports of entry are typically from office of field operations also a part of cbp ofo works the ports obp the land in between office of air and marine runs the rivers and skies
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,yea thats why they support ecoterrorists and cells of them in the pacific nw drive spikes into trees so the lumber mill saw blades explode
IAmA,not_removed,thats not what i took from that answer she works for greenpeace they have paid staff
IAmA,not_removed,nah she went to harvard for undergrad usc for law she was in private practice for a few years before going to green peace i believe she studied abroad at oxford as well she comes from money of this there can be no doubt so what she does with her time is of little consequence the rules that apply to the working class do not apply to her
IAmA,not_removed,sounds to me like shes a professional protestor
IAmA,not_removed,are you surprised by that answer
IAmA,not_removed,its easier to protest people who try to change things than it is to actually try to change things
IAmA,not_removed,romney would have been an ideal candidate
IAmA,not_removed,your rebuttal
IAmA,not_removed,i agree with her answer id rather have no cheif diplomat than put exxon in charge of foreign policy
IAmA,not_removed,honoring green cards is different from not honoring them freezing the refugee program is different from banning all travel from those countries i dont know how to explain the severe gap in similarities there any simpler than that
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,check out his interview with minutes for a good start
IAmA,not_removed,russia is an enemy because of their interference in our political process and those of our allies and because of their violent expansionism affecting our allies if they cut that out i have no problem with them being an ally
IAmA,not_removed,the republican platform is really extending itself to anyone who isnt a cheerleader for democrats
IAmA,not_removed,the spineful alternative would be her trying to make good puns and jokes out of those negative comments to entertain redditors i dont think she is really interested in doing that its pretty clear she just wants to talk about rubios spine
IAmA,not_removed,uhm i think shes saying that he was spineless because of how much his position changed if he was seemingly against tillerson before or at least cautiouscritical about him why would he suddenly forget those issues and be totes cool with him allegedly he was lobbied into being totes cool with tillerson she is calling him spineless for doing a on his positions bc of some cash
IAmA,not_removed,just peace out of here thecheetobenito is here early in full force so there isnt much for us to do here man i wish i could get paid by soros to do what millions of people are already doing on their own
IAmA,not_removed,so as i said soros you think his open society foundation doesnt have a hand in that
IAmA,not_removed,idk like ted is horrible but he gave that speech about voting for country rather than party at the republican convention maybe ted would be willing to resist its worth a shot at least
IAmA,not_removed,my senator is jeff sessions i would offer to trade but hes about to be all of our problem
IAmA,not_removed,please call him and ask him to withdraw the first amendment defense act
IAmA,not_removed,mine was jeff sessions 😢
IAmA,not_removed,cruz needs the right prod to get him off the reservation that look of soul crushing defeat when he was doing cold calls for the election was cathartic but very telling
IAmA,not_removed,you should both call republicans should feel the peoples disgust more than anyone they should be made aware than if they continue to humor the irrational and bigoted measures of trump they wont ever work again this is people that are displaying that they dont actually care about country or even party as much as they care about their jobs show them that if they keep doing what trump wants even when its clearly against the countrys best interests their careers will be over it should be at least
IAmA,not_removed,town halls hahahahahaha if hes like my republican rep he has telephone town halls and inviteonly fundraisers thats it no uncomfortable public appearances
IAmA,not_removed,i mean the dude has negotiated with nations that are hostile to america without having the threat of force to tip the scales if were talking about negotiations where a single bullet being fired could mean a large scale war there are certainly worse people for the job
IAmA,not_removed,bro she carried a spine around back off she obvi knows totes more than you
IAmA,not_removed,oil took a billions of people out of poverty over the decades
IAmA,not_removed,shhhhh dont tell ireland
IAmA,not_removed,oh they care but only about their bottom line the rest is for after they are gone so why bother
IAmA,not_removed,natural gas is only a patch to get us from coal to renewables it pollutes in the ground instead of up in the air but its out of sight out of mind for the folks not relying on those aquafirs
IAmA,not_removed,solar wind and turbine are the future of renewable energy putting a profossil fuel elected official will diminish the leaps and bounds hat us has tried to catch up on united states is no longer a pioneer or leader in solition to climate control pair that with legislature that has already begun to dismantle federal land up for sale no backbone to back the people only his allegiances pockets
IAmA,not_removed,global warming is as adequate as climate change if not more so because it encompasses both climate change and the general direction of the change it was changed because stupid people dont know the meaning of global and were contesting it because their area became colder glad to see you took the chance to shit on the leftist types while showing your ignorance
IAmA,not_removed,that doesnt mean they should be promoted to high office if they are running companies that are counter to the public interests especially if theyve spent millions undermining public trust and understanding of science to further their goals
IAmA,not_removed,the companies use profits to buy politicians who place regulations and regulators that the companies control to increase profits so they can buy politicians and so on
IAmA,not_removed,i have a friend who was born in america his parents immigrated from the middle east i asked his opinion on trumps immigration policy and he said it would likely make no difference his family has been trying to bring relatives to america for decades with no success
IAmA,not_removed,you know what people like you are fucking lost did obama suddenly ban immigration from countries out of the blue were green card holders deliberately included had obama previously made statements about banning muslim immigration into the usa did obama make vague stipulations about minority religions while telling christian groups that hed make exceptions for christians pull your head out of your ass
IAmA,not_removed,they can and should be held in contempt of court lawyers are working on that but if the entire force is going to defy the order its hard to see the entire cbp staff being arrested
IAmA,not_removed,surely you recognize that the reason for this is because of a fundamental difference of opinion in what is good for the country and that what may have been stone walling has been done by individuals over the past years only some of which will be the same individuals now asking for compromise rather than the same generalized group not all democrats think the same on every issue not all left leaning people feel the same way about every issue they dont need to be lumped together and assumed wrong on every issue because that would be unwise if only by showing how their ideas are invalid by reason to strengthen the position of your own ideas their ideas are worth hearing out and if you find that you cannot find a compelling reason to show why their idea is invalid or unsound then maybe you might even find that one of your own ideas is less concrete than you may have supposed
IAmA,not_removed,obama alienated republicans as soon as he arrived and constantly tried to push things through without compromise i guess reddit is young so they dont remember how that started to begin with
IAmA,not_removed,shes not crying about it someone asked so she answered
IAmA,not_removed,try district offices people often try the dc offices but your senator will have one or more office around your state make sure you give the staffer your zip code
IAmA,not_removed,are women manlets now or do we just attempt to be insulting without even looking at the pictures in the links these days you didnt even have to read
IAmA,not_removed,you know what to do
IAmA,not_removed,whip this man hes inciting a lynching
IAmA,not_removed,coal contains traces of uranium radium thorium and potassium everything is at least slightly radioactive
IAmA,not_removed,therell be most likely a wikipedia article about it not sure whether it will be biased or not
IAmA,not_removed,activists in general only care about science if it suits their agenda i dare you to look at their page regarding golden rice and not gag their page on gm food in general is also pretty shitty last paragraph we also oppose all patents on plants animals and humans as well as patents on their genes biology is not an industrial commodity we should not force life forms and our worlds food supply to conform to human economic models patents are a concern but thats not exclusive to gmos the rest honestly shows how far removed they are from the world if they really believe that they should protest against all agriculture and any medicine that s been properly tested
IAmA,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikicriticismofgreenpeace
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to be part of an organization that denies science on gm technology while you are crying about politicians denying science on climate change no clear mention of carrying around a spine
IAmA,not_removed,where do the chills go if theres no spine
IAmA,not_removed,thats why i put it in quotes
IAmA,not_removed,greenpeace oh so scum
IAmA,not_removed,so shes a professional protestor on mom and dads dime got it
IAmA,not_removed,so she really understands the working class and the plight of immigrants then or maybe she just likes to argue and thinks that using the moral high ground makes her less of an obnoxious contrarian
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt that make anybody who works for greenpeace the aclu or any other advocacy or lobbying organization a professional protestor she has her job and fwiw i take it to be as legitimate a calling as anyone else prodding at capitol hill both for the good and the bad
IAmA,not_removed,paid by soros
IAmA,not_removed,nope
IAmA,not_removed,is that what i was doing no i just disagree with her i like the tillerson pick he has strong experience and ties both foreign and domestic i like his viewpoints on russia and on a personal note i sit next to a guy that worked for mr tillerson for many years and he wont stop telling me about how smart he is
IAmA,not_removed,thats not an option she keeps refusing to give actual valuable responses
IAmA,not_removed,the order does honor green cards its days not permanent and the administration allows exceptions to the order on a case by case basis sounds pretty similar to me
IAmA,not_removed,people who want to see them as the same will you literally cant change their mind to them all citizens of iraq refugees apparently so theres no difference
IAmA,not_removed,exactly the point isnt that we cant be allies but that being allies is counterproductive and dangerous not to mention counterintuitive when trying to navigate relations with our current allies
IAmA,not_removed,lul like we can be the ones preaching about staying out of other countries elections
IAmA,not_removed,lets not be hypocrites though how many elections in foreign countries have the usa interfered with and influenced to push their agenda so its cool for us to interfere with everyone elses political process but were surprised when somebody does it to us
IAmA,not_removed,or actually answer other questions about her stance on tillerson greenpeace stances lawyer work involving the executive order so on and so forth its not hard to find actual questions in this thread its hard to find her answering them though
IAmA,not_removed,if you want politicans who dont change their position in light of more information you want dictators
IAmA,not_removed,positions cant change where were the spine bearers when obama signed off on the patriot act twice
IAmA,not_removed,nah shes just a naive liberal retard asking tough questions doesnt mean youre against the guy sometimes you ask your friends tough questions does that mean youre no longer friend
IAmA,not_removed,uhm i think shes saying that he was spineless because of how much his position changed which you can only do if you inferred that he was against tillerson because he actually did his job and asked him tough questions when i used to hire people id ask them tough questions that didnt necessarily mean that i was against them or didnt want to hire them youre assuming based on no evidence other than how rubio questioned tillerson that rubio was opposed to tillerson that may not have been the case if you cant know for sure what his actual position was you cant say he completely reversed it
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i came here for interesting questions but there are only people stating false information
IAmA,not_removed,not rex they seem to be buddies ted speaks his mind i guess i can give him that much itd be better if my congressman wasnt louie anchor baby gohmert but ive got nothing good
IAmA,not_removed,he gave that speech but then ended up voting for the guy he opposed so no shot
IAmA,not_removed,lol mines steve palazzo and he supports jeff
IAmA,not_removed,calling senator hatch today to try to stop this
IAmA,not_removed,i read that bill it seems the main gripe is using tax code to punish groups that do not approve of gay marriage that wiki link looks misleading am i missing something
IAmA,not_removed,this guy seems to be just copying and pasting the same logic in multiple places its not that hes negotiated xyz without bullets or whateverthere are tons of ceos who could be chose who negotiate well its that this man has a very large stake in oil exploration which tips the scales away from serving the interest of the american people and towards the pockets of him and his friends i bet the first thing he does is lift the sanctions on russia for the invasion of crimea which you will note is not in the interest of democracy but in the interest of exxon
IAmA,not_removed,can you please explain to me how natural gas pollutes the ground
IAmA,not_removed,re your final point obama and his administration charted approved and ran that course they only halted it recently because they knew trump would start it up again thaaaaats politics thats a rocketship
IAmA,not_removed,solar wind and turbine are shit forms of energy production if the us tried to switch entirely to the wed regress to the agrarian days of the late in terms of energy production does that really seem like something we should do
IAmA,not_removed,can you explain how those sources will have enough energy at peak times pm
IAmA,not_removed,or it was changed from global because maybe justaybe it was too broad of a paint stroke im sorry it took me making fun of you to bring out the nasty name calling i sincerely did not intend on triggering you dudebro
IAmA,not_removed,hard but absolutely necessary executive agents cannot ignore a court order that is absolutely the most dangerous development yet
IAmA,not_removed,these people have mouths to feed have you no shame its hard on both sides but to suggest they be incarcerated for erring on the side caution as pensions and mortgages are on the line is hogwash especially as at the end of the day youll still be earning
IAmA,not_removed,well said my friend
IAmA,not_removed,few years ago i was running a blog on skepticism in my country and i had several encounters with local greenpeace all they do is translating documents and answers from above and copypasting every serious discussion with their activists ended up in logical fallacies and monsanto corporations farmers i knew she wont answer my question it doesnt fit her and their current agenda to exploit
IAmA,not_removed,brain freeze i would imagine
IAmA,not_removed,id rather be on the side of scum fighting to preserve the natural world for the next generation than the scum fighting to allow the natural world to be degraded beyond recognition
IAmA,not_removed,she makes between according to glassdoor not much for where she lives but id imagine she has a trust or two set up for her benefit and comfort fun fact her private practice focused on gender and asylum issues she has monetized social justice cant hate on that
IAmA,not_removed,she is pretty hot hired political gun for talking head tv shows is always an option
IAmA,not_removed,thats exactly right
IAmA,not_removed,i mean to be fair hers was a troll response as well she could have taken the opportunity to spark a discussion about who she thinks is more qualified but she did not
IAmA,not_removed,add into this milieu that russia needs us more than we need them and the onus should be on russia to work to cultivate a good relationship its unseemly that were trying so hard to please russia
IAmA,not_removed,its not about preaching its about not letting our own elections and political process and those of our allies be thrown and individual citizens in the us can definitely speak out without being accused of hypocrisy since that type of interventionism has been historically unpopular on the left
IAmA,not_removed,first of all what we did was fucked up second does that mean we have to just sit here and take it from russia
IAmA,not_removed,yeah a texas senator taking a stand on an oil robber baron as sos that makes as much sense as ted cruzs face
IAmA,not_removed,law gives me the right to withhold employment from you because youre gay i could do so legally since the feds would no longer have the authority to enforce nondiscrimination laws
IAmA,not_removed,i hold similar misgivings about the potential for tillerson to abuse this power but i dont see it as a certainty as you do however i will contend that the nature of international negotiations in the oil and gas industry is different than just about any other international industry and the skills and experiences a person participating in those discussions would attain are more in line with those of the state than say the experiences that a ceo at mcdonalds would have
IAmA,not_removed,the goal is to get away from coal energy production not go backwards in envoirnmentsl impact no shit hydro isnt producing because climate change has caused a drought diminishing water in dams to produce the mw that we need solar is the future for climate sustainability there is a reason that countries are committing to energy they see the cause and effect of fossil fuels and determined the right course wind turbines are great for valleys and plains to provide electric support such as san francisco and palm desert
IAmA,not_removed,solar battery back switch to traditional resources if needed wind doesnt take a break from hydro electric produces a lot of power for california however is being affected by climate change going back to clean coal which there is no such thing only makes it worse there is valid reason why other countries are switch to renewable energy and thats because its sustainable and beneficial to the war on climate change
IAmA,not_removed,im literally shaking
IAmA,not_removed,without a spine there is no brain i checked wikipedia and it turns out invertebrates are well capable of growing a brain why am i contradicting myself in my own comment maybe im drunk maybe im i like truth no im just drunk
IAmA,not_removed,not for marco rubio
IAmA,not_removed,you dont know much about greenpeace they dont do shit for whaling industries or big oil they do stupid shit like this and much worse
IAmA,not_removed,if she has a law degree but doesnt practice what is she making for
IAmA,not_removed,im not saying to sit here and take it just its just pretty hypocritical of our government to complain about something they seem to do more than any other country i dont want anyone to interfere with our elections unless were getting the dirt on both candidates its biased so i dont like it personally i like being able to see the dirt and would welcome it if it was unbiased
IAmA,not_removed,letting oil companies step all over us sure makes sense worked for la i work for oil i get it but they need our land badly they should be stepping aside for us not vice versa but the texas government is subpar
IAmA,not_removed,its not that i see it as a certainty its that it used to be that even the potential for these guys to abuse it was a way to disqualify them from appointment hell jimmy carter sold his damn peanut farm in georgia to avoid conflicts of interest nowadays we see corporate plundering and government as the same thing and dont give a shit if this guy could gain tens of millions from his actions in taxpayer funded position
IAmA,not_removed,hydro is pretty much peaked out current battery technology is not even close to good enough to store the energy we need plus a lot of the rare earth metals come from rain forests its not constantly windy so that one will need batteries also most of the counties that gone renewable are from using hydro primarily
IAmA,not_removed,put on a jacket
IAmA,not_removed,hmm well they certainly dont go to his balls this is quite the mystery
IAmA,not_removed,help me out here i cant tell if you are just one of those ridiculously gullible people who have been taken in by the rights parody version of greenpeace or if you just hate environmentalism in all its forms
IAmA,not_removed,her linkedin says shes an attorney for greenpeace thats what they pay their attorneys
IAmA,not_removed,because believe it or not nonprofits pay attorneys too not every single lawyer ever works in private practice
IAmA,not_removed,not that that totally mitigates what youre saying but at least its something i dont know if that makes you feel any better
IAmA,not_removed,the only thing left is the sphincter
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget that one time they httpsnewsvicecomarticledronefootageshowsextentofdamagefromgreenpeacestuntatnazcalines to put up a stupid sign
IAmA,not_removed,wheres he gonna go after years of sos ornamental horticulture nah hes going straight back to the oil industry
IAmA,not_removed,fwiw hes actually barred from reentering the oil industry for years as part of the deal tillerson would agree not to work in the oil and gas sector for a decade if he breaks that covenant he would lose the value transferred to the independent trust which would then distribute its capital to one or more charities involved in fighting poverty or disease in the developing world according to exxon
IAmA,not_removed,in dick tracey there was a scene where dick tracey jumps on top of a pole and slides down and everytime i watch this movie i notice how hard the stunt double hits the pole did you watch this happen
IAmA,not_removed,hey warren with a career of incredible movies spanning decades box office successes magazine covers talk shows red carpets and oscar nominations do you sometimes find it overwhelming to be the husband of annette bening

IAmA,not_removed,hi warren thanks for doing this ama do you see any relation in the character you played senator bulworth and donald trump both guys that didnt give a fuck what they said and somehow get more popular for doing it also what is your opinion of donald trump
IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty thank you for doing this ama i recently watched bulworth for the first time at the behest of a friend who said it was oddly prescient of the rise of a certain orangehued major party presidential candidate who tells it like it is obviously jay bulworth was more of a speak truth to power instead of an exploit the fears of the people in order to obtain power type figure but i was wondering does the message of bulworth have anything to say to the presidential race a more specific question as donald trump halfheartedly attempts to court the african american community does the church scene in bulworth have anything to say to democrats or for that matter african americans today what changes to our system would you like to see to force either party address the concerns of nonmonied groups
IAmA,not_removed,ive noticed that rules dont apply will be your first film in fifteen years are there any recent directorsstars that youre interested in working with for another film or will this film be your swan song
IAmA,not_removed,what was your favorite location to film in
IAmA,not_removed,good afternoon mr beatty i am a big fan of movies based on comic books and i truly enjoyed your film dick tracy my question is what was it like working with danny elfman while he was scoring the film have a great day
IAmA,not_removed,ive written and performed off bway a solo show called great white american teeth about growing up in rural ireland obsessed with american culture and tvfilm a whole segment is devoted to you if i brought it to la would you come see it

IAmA,not_removed,hi mr beatty im a huge fan of your work my question is what would be the biggest challenge you had to face while shooting rules dont apply
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr beatty im so honored to be asking you anything at all im a huge fan of your work particularly bonnie clyde dick tracy bugsy i watch dick tracy a lot more than the others and i have questions regarding that film how were you able to get the vfx shots in the film without using a single computer will you ever return to the character in the near future and if so would it be a sequel or a prequel
IAmA,not_removed,if you could work with one director who would it be
IAmA,not_removed,will there be a dick tracy and could breathless be in a coma all this time and come back to seek revenge on the city that would be epic with madonna of course

IAmA,not_removed,i love the songs from dick tracy and i love your cameo on madonnas im breathless album any chance youd ever consider doing a fullfledged musical

IAmA,not_removed,what is your favorite film that robert towne directed
IAmA,not_removed,hi warren ive always counted dick tracy and bulworth among my favorite films theres a moment in each that always come to mind when i think of your signature style when protagonists have moments of appreciation for the women in their lives accented by unusually strong overhead lighting you glow vittorio storaro was on cinematography for both but im curious to know did you have this specifically in mind when establishing your vision as a director prior to working with him directly and thank you for not giving up on rules dont apply i really wasnt sure wed get to see this when things sort of went silent on the movie after the all the buzz about your return to the chair
IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty youve been a trailblazer for progressive politics and ive read that you stumped for robert kennedy and george mcgovern ive been a registered democrat for years now and in that time i feel as if the democratic party has lost their way given all the shenanigans that took place during the primary i feel as if the progressive platform is dead and its corpse has been devoured by special interests my question is this what is your take on this election cycle and do you have any advice for a disheartened democrat now independent

IAmA,not_removed,when was the last time you laughed so hard that you cried
IAmA,not_removed,hi mr beatty is there a role you were ever up for that you didnt get but deeply regret missing out on
IAmA,not_removed,just wanted to say that reds is one of my favorite films of all time i dont know what it is the idealism of the characters their transformations the gritty and progressive subject matter taking place at a time far before the when civil rights and liberal thought really entered the mainstream but i just cant love that movie any more was it difficult to get the studio to commit to a movie of that length did they try to get you cut it down but you refused
IAmA,not_removed,is it true youve slept with women
IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty im a really big fan of your films since my dad showed me dick tracy when i was a kid my question to you as someone whos been in the film industry for a long time and watched it evolve what are you likes and dislikes about where film is today would changes would you make to todays film industry andor audiences thank you so much for doing this ama
IAmA,not_removed,having done a number of films in different genres would you consider being in an improv film like those directed by henry jaglom or christopher guest
IAmA,not_removed,has any politician in recent memory reminded you of bulworth
IAmA,not_removed,hi mr beatty i heard a story many years ago about how you got bulworth greenlit despite a head of studio change that would seemed to have worked in your disfavor from my memory basically the story went you walked into the meeting pretending that the film had already been greenlit for a budget of million plus and that preproduction was well under way you then got the studio head to be relieved to greenlight the film at a mill budget even though the studio head initially wanted to scrap the project entirely the story as told was likely sixdegrees removed so it wouldnt be surprising to me if it was untrue i wanted to hear about how you did manage to get that film made also did you experience any similar resistancesupport getting reds made despite the controversial political overtones
IAmA,not_removed,what is your favorite memory of natalie wood
IAmA,not_removed,what the heck have you been up to the past years
IAmA,not_removed,are you still as handsome as ever
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,i grew up on your dick tracy movie and i think it absolutely pioneered what has become a billiondollar industry onto itself youve been talking up another instalment for a number of years and ive been excited as hell at the thought of another beattyled tracy film what has been the holdup to get it off the ground
IAmA,not_removed,have you seen empire records and did you enjoy the reference to yourself if so

IAmA,not_removed,how did you guys light the beach bungelow in reds a friend and i he is an afi cinematography grad were trying to figure it out one day in hopes of recreating the style in a short we were doing i am a gaffer the best we could come up with was that it was mostly bounce from practical sources creating diffused pools and we suspected heads placed behind the beams on the ceiling among practicals and what ever mixed source from bfls outside for day or moonlight also your talk in the notes about how it was working with diane keaton to get the performances was one that sticks with me to this day not directly stated but taking that entire scene and scheduling the time to make it right really resonated with me cheers

IAmA,not_removed,bull worth was so ahead of its time and is still relevant today do you feel it got the respect that it deserved
IAmA,not_removed,do any of your kids show an interest in the film industry
IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty i think your role in bulworth would resonate really well with the current election cycle do you think you should go ahead and run as an independent on his exact platforms possibly minus the sick verses and you are a great actor as well but that movie was one of my instant favorites looking forward to your upcoming film
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr beatty im glad youre back in the directors chair in both trailers of rules dont apply the hughess epic hells angels is featured i personally think that film is an eccentric but brilliant film what do you think of that film by howard hughes

IAmA,not_removed,you know how some kids wear play costumes of their favorite super heroes usually its superman sometimes batman i remember seeing ninja turtle masks from time to time i was rocking my yellow hat and trench coat jumping on top of little tike cars recreating some of my favorite scenes from dick tracy i spent five years asking santa for an action figure of the blank it was only available in canada but it was pictured on the back of the box in the united states anyway my family and i didnt know this it was the last one i needed to complete the entire collection but the hunt for it was actually very fun i used to go see the stage show at disneyland nearly every week we were local and had annual passes it was one of the first vhs tapes i ever had and one of the first video games i ever had from the bottom of my heart thank you for being an integral part of some of my favorite childhood memories
IAmA,not_removed,warren have you ever dressed up in the dick tracy costume for halloween or just for fun

IAmA,not_removed,whats it like being bro to shirley maclaine kind of different temperaments so it appears but both troopers
IAmA,not_removed,i love dick tracy i only remember seeing it as a year old child but im wondering how you would feel if somehow they magically asked you to star in a sequel to dick tracy
IAmA,not_removed,did it occur to you that something was wrong when you saw emma stone written on the card or was it just too much fun to throw faye dunaway under the bus

IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty i have a chunk of pork in my mouth and im not planning on chewing it or swallowing it do you have any idea if its possible for my saliva to dissolve the chunk and if it is possible can you say how long it will take for my saliva to dissolve the piece of pork
IAmA,not_removed,rules dont apply looks great but do you feel that by waiting you missed an opportunity to do a drama about hughes because scorsese did it first and do you still have that painting madonna gave you of an aviator
IAmA,not_removed,mr beatty thanks for doing this youve already brought one iconic comic book character to life in dick tracy would you have any interest in doing it again perhaps by joining robert redford and michael douglas in the marvel universe
IAmA,not_removed,hi warren is the reason postproduction on rules dont apply took so long that you had to get your face reconstructed after ripping it off like you did in the music video for ghetto superstar
IAmA,not_removed,is it true there wasis an r rated version of dick tracy i hope we get a nice restoration soon
IAmA,not_removed,what was natalie wood like do you buy the explanation of her death

IAmA,not_removed,who was the funniest person you worked with on set what did they do to deserve that title
IAmA,not_removed,hello mr beatty considering your long lasting film legacy and popularity i was surprised to see that youve acted in relatively few films do you believe in quality over quantity thanks
IAmA,not_removed,hi mr beatty thanks for doing this ama what movie would you recommend everyone watch at least once
IAmA,not_removed,looking at the state of american politics do you think bulworth was ahead of its time also do you think kanye could win
IAmA,not_removed,why howard hughes what fascinates you the most about him
IAmA,not_removed,hello and welcome to reddit youre one of those rare actors who can do both dramatic and comedic roles how do you account for this heaven can wait is pitch perfect comedy while reds is such an epic drama is there any difference in the way you prepare for either or does it just come naturally also did you write the raps in bulworth love the awkward freestyle
IAmA,not_removed,is donald trump reenacting bulworth for real
IAmA,not_removed,which is your worst movie town and country or ishtar
IAmA,not_removed,that was me
IAmA,not_removed,no one posted this yet yikes
IAmA,not_removed,the best thing that ever happened to me is annette bening
IAmA,not_removed,that my mother and father visited me on the set for the first time since it was the first movie i produced my mother was a smoker she and my father sat in and witnessed a production meeting i saw her smoking and i asked her in front of the group if she loved me there was an embarrassing silence she said to me of course i love you why would you ask a question like that i then said well if you love me will you put that cigarette out and never smoke another one she stared down at the cigarette in her hand for a while and then she put it out she never smoked another cigarette
IAmA,not_removed,carly simon httpwwwpeoplecomarticlecarlysimonconfirmsyouresovainsecondversereferstowarrenbeatty but the other two verses are about two other men
IAmA,not_removed,thats a decision only you can make
IAmA,not_removed,i actually cant remember someone ever asking me that question ned beatty and i dont know each other very well but i admire his work
IAmA,not_removed,arrogance
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,youre right about ishtar its a long story about the way it was handled
IAmA,not_removed,to stop thinking about trying to come across as charismatic and engaging
IAmA,not_removed,just be like michael caine or was it roger moore talk low talk slow and dont bump into the furniture
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,i feel lily collins has an unlimited potential in movies she makes brave choices its hard to take your eyes off of her on screen and her chemistry with alden ehrenreich was both hilarious and moving
IAmA,not_removed,no but our hilarious and romantic leading man in rules dont apply alden ehrenreich is the new han solo
IAmA,not_removed,no
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,he wore it in the dick tracy special on tcm what i want to know is if he kept the watch now that they couldnt pry away from me
IAmA,not_removed,ronald reagan or maybe barack obama i might add that ronald reagan who was a friend of mine once said to me not joking that he did not know how anyone could be president now without being an actor
IAmA,not_removed,no
IAmA,not_removed,written
IAmA,not_removed,ive spent a lot of my life in political activism i campaigned for jack kennedy i campaigned with bobby kennedy and quit movies for a while to work with george mcgovern and help him try to get us out of vietnam ive remained a lifelong democrat although i have as many friends who are republicans what concerns me most at the moment is that the commercialization of the use of technology may be creating a cacophony of opinions that obliterates voices of wisdom
IAmA,not_removed,bob altman was a lot of fun to work with he was brilliantly flexible and improvisational
IAmA,not_removed,who unfortunately passed away recently
IAmA,not_removed,i would call it a hal ashbyrobert townewarren beatty movie we were all happily involved
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,my name isnt fucking warren
IAmA,not_removed,i dont like to separate them and i dont like the actors i work with to separate them i like to have everyone feel they are directing at the same time as we are acting together theyre not but i like them to feel that they are anyway
IAmA,not_removed,groucho was a friend of mine i have to go with that i was never close to karl marx
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,i love virginia but i love where i live – california
IAmA,not_removed,my favorite memory from bugsy is how i lost interest in the garlic chicken i was eating two seconds after i met annette bening for the first time
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,my mother was from nova scotia
IAmA,not_removed,annette obviously
IAmA,not_removed,standing holding two camels on a street in marrakesh with dustin hoffman staring at one another
IAmA,not_removed,many years of being amused by what friends of his told me about him
IAmA,not_removed,probably annie hall
IAmA,not_removed,yes thank god someone made a success out of that pedophile
IAmA,not_removed,i have been experiencing fatherhood with the most fascinating people on earth annette and my four kids whom i like to refer to as small eastern european countries all democracies but with chiefs of state firmly ensconced and each one more interesting than any movies people might find bulworth more interesting now than when it was released
IAmA,not_removed,what jay bulworth is saying is very very different from that which mr trump is saying
IAmA,not_removed,rich people have always stayed on top by dividing white people from colored people yeah thats not really trumps platform but maybe it is in his playbook
IAmA,not_removed,hollywood
IAmA,not_removed,there was a rumor years ago that he was to star in a remake from kazan
IAmA,not_removed,ive met a lot of celebs in my time and warren was the only one i was momentarily speechless with i got over it real quick though hes very nice ps ace love affair question above its one of my favorites too i still have the poster
IAmA,not_removed,no
IAmA,not_removed,i would have to meet the rabbit that is the size of the horse
IAmA,not_removed,why are you yelling at warren beatty
IAmA,not_removed,i hope i can assume that you dont feel thats a serious question the thing for me to respond to with a question like that is why are you asking it in the first place and have we reached a point that anyone can publish anything thats not true about anybody and why this has occurred and whether it would be a mistake for a person to respond to your question and thereby perpetuate the ridiculousness this subject – the obsession with sex – that so permeates our american culture is what lies beneath the movie i just made and makes us the laughing stock of other countries the comically sad consequences of american sexual puritanism i believe ive had something like or books written about me ive never read more than or pages of any of them im told theyre full of boloney and i have never cooperated with a writer of a socalled biography of me certainly not the one you just mentioned who used this preposterous statement in an attempt to sell his book im told the book is also chock full of other insane inaccuracies that have nothing to do with sex thank you for asking
IAmA,not_removed,theres a very big difference between spewing hatred and ignorance trump and speaking truths that go left unsaid for the sake of politics bullworth youre missing the point of bullworth
IAmA,not_removed,bloody hell is there any more to this story
IAmA,not_removed,hollywood insurance companies were gutsy back then
IAmA,not_removed,annette bening is the best thing to happen to all of us
IAmA,not_removed,that comment just made my day and im not even annette bening
IAmA,not_removed,i bet you even got to see her dressed up as catwoman too didnt you you lucky bastard
IAmA,not_removed,my moms version of those events are you insinuating that i am not capable of both loving you and smoking at the same time you little shit

IAmA,not_removed,hey its me ur brother

IAmA,not_removed,i love it thank you i do hope some time you can come see my show i just performed the warren segment on saturday for the irish rep in nyc attended by matt broderick small world
IAmA,not_removed,the commercialization of the use of technology may be creating a cacophony of opinions that obliterates voices of wisdom quote of the year id add that the cacophony of opinions are replacing facts ill pick on republicans since i lean right myself was watching the video of the cnn reporter interviewing people at a trump rally one lady was questioned about birtherism and whether it should continue her response was well yes we need to hear what he has to say for himself when the reporter flatly said he released his birth certificate in the lady wryly smiled shook her head and said noooo in complete disbelief
IAmA,not_removed,thank you mr beatty im a dem as well and ive been a year hardcore fan so glad to see you back onscreen
IAmA,not_removed,well said
IAmA,not_removed,creating a cacophony of opinions that obliterates voices of wisdom youre going to have to dumb that down to reach those who are using the most pervasive form of technology today social media if theyre going to understand it scariest part of all is how many of them vote
IAmA,not_removed,the scene where his wife passed away in law order to this day still breaks my heart
IAmA,not_removed,karl was my favorite not very funny but he could write the hell out of a manifesto
IAmA,not_removed,groucho is my idol well one of them always felt he was an underappreciated writer though i wonder did he ever write you a letter

IAmA,not_removed,do you have scissorsfobia now can you use scissors
IAmA,not_removed,im so sorry for what happened glad youre okay though thats a super sick bar story has the incident changed the way you think or look at the world
IAmA,not_removed,if you were in a room with your president and your mugger who would you be most afraid of
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure which part of your body youre being stabbed before and can you describe in detail as much as you can on what you feel the moment you were stabbed until the point when you arrived at the hospital
IAmA,not_removed,did you survive
IAmA,not_removed,do you feel like you have to watch your surroundings more often or are you just as laid back of your surroundings before the stabbing
IAmA,not_removed,your an xmen why didnt you fight back
IAmA,not_removed,who were you trying to mug for them to stab you with scissors
IAmA,not_removed,shouldnt you be dead
IAmA,not_removed,do you know a form of self defence and if not dyou feel some kind of self defence training would have helped

IAmA,not_removed,how would you describe the sensation of being stabbed
IAmA,not_removed,did you get your phone back
IAmA,not_removed,did u get your phone back
IAmA,not_removed,was dirty duterte the attacker
IAmA,not_removed,did they run with the scissors
IAmA,not_removed,i assume you were saturated with antibiotics at the hospital i can just imagine some random scissors and its attendant microbes penetrating your lungs shiver
IAmA,not_removed,but did you get your phone back
IAmA,not_removed,whats the medical care like in the philippines will you have to pay for your treatment also where in the philippines do you live i visited a few years ago touristy places tbh had a great time walking around manilla being told i was tall and handsome as a mediocre looking guy ive never experienced this in the uk
IAmA,not_removed,have you dealt with any ptsd symptoms afterwards
IAmA,not_removed,did you die
IAmA,not_removed,did you die 😋
IAmA,not_removed,did it hurt more than stubbing your toe
IAmA,not_removed,after you got stabbed were you more cautious about things what changed about your daily life
IAmA,not_removed,scissors or an ice pic
IAmA,not_removed,was it your fault
IAmA,not_removed,i was hoping the proof would be a picture of you being stabbed disappointing
IAmA,not_removed,do you think that youre super special or something fuck i was stabbed in the chest with a pencil during the second grade thats when i learned that not all black people are friendly some just want to fuck you up
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for sharing an interesting read first off i am extremely happy you are alright i am a us city police officer and strongly despise hearing stories like this and wish i could have been there to help now for some questions i apologize if they have already been answered but due to a long day of dealing with drunks im feeling lazy how deep was the stab wound i understand adrenaline had spiked rapidly and you may not have felt it but could you explain what it felt like going into and through your skin what were your thoughts during the start of the physical altercation did you think you were going to die have the criminals faced justice if none of them havent served justice for what they have done to you they are most likely in the cage for a crime related to what they did to you or not just remember karma gets those types of people keep strong
IAmA,not_removed,is that xavier university in cincinnati ohio
IAmA,not_removed,was it worth being stabbed for your laptop
IAmA,not_removed,do you know that you probably should not publish that photo of your id on the internet i mean it is probably nothing but at the same time it has your name and your id number and your university etc some asshole might use the info to do something you may want to take it down
IAmA,not_removed,why didnt you just shoot him
IAmA,not_removed,is the world a dangerous place to live in do you feel safer have you turned paranoid for your safety concerns
IAmA,not_removed,how often do you get adrenaline spikes after i got in a somewhat similar altercation my adrenaline would shoot through the roof whenever i thought about it or got sketched out by someone
IAmA,not_removed,why is this something that people should know about
IAmA,not_removed,did u deserve it
IAmA,not_removed,will the attackers be killed by the law guys who mugged me were drug addicts they were caught the next day
IAmA,not_removed,why do you think anyone here cares
IAmA,not_removed,why the fuck are you on reddit
IAmA,not_removed,got any more interesting stories
IAmA,not_removed,did it hurt
IAmA,not_removed,omg really this is how pathetic amas have become youre not exactly stephen hawking now are you
IAmA,not_removed,have you started a nonprofit to push for regulation of scissor sales
IAmA,not_removed,are you sure this was an accident it seems like this was on purpise
IAmA,not_removed,why did you punk out and let him rob you
IAmA,not_removed,sort of xd
IAmA,not_removed,oh my lordy though i was in an attempted stabbing a week ago and literally the thing i hope that stopped him was me yelling very loudly at am i might add go ahead ive got to get to work though
IAmA,not_removed,hey sorry for the late reply xd so i was walking home and i noticed immediately that three guys started to follow me this was already a huge red flag but then there was a guy up ahead so i was thinking if they do anything this guy will probably help so when i walked past the guy he walked away thats when the three guys surrounded me they wanted my phone and my bag which had my laptop and money in it i tried to act tough but deep inside i was scared shitless tbh give us your phone they said so i was like what youre gonna stab me they responded by saying if you scream well stab you so thats when i decided to hand them my phone then they told me to give them my bag i resisted because my laptop has my life in it so they got mad and just tried to pull it off me and run as they did i managed to grab the strap of my bag it was a messenger bag and pulled it back they fell and thats when they got really mad so they pushed me at the time being i thought that they just beat me up after they pushed me but thats when i got stabbed then a car passed by so they got scared and ran leaving my bag so i got my bag and chased after them i dont know the exact distance but it was pretty lengthy while i was chasing them a guy on a motorcycle offered to help but before i could climb on the motorcycle the guy pointed out i was bleeding thankfully the area they ran to was near a hospital so i just ran to the er immediately hope this answers your questions xd
IAmA,not_removed,i did not actually realize i was stabbed so when they ran i chased them later in the hospital the pain started and i can only describe it as blinding each time i took a breath it felt like something was digging into my lungs
IAmA,not_removed,getting hitstabbed in that kind of a moment feels like nothing fight or flight is stronk and youre p much pure adrenaline at that point
IAmA,not_removed,like warm apple pie
IAmA,not_removed,maybe thats how this whole thing started a game of rock paper scissors but the other guy came prepared
IAmA,not_removed,i wish i could give gold to this comment
IAmA,not_removed,they were caught the next day but honestly i didnt feel anything towards them i just wanted my phone back
IAmA,not_removed,im fine this happened three months ago
IAmA,not_removed,i wish i did xd
IAmA,not_removed,one cut it out the second cut him some slack and the third cut the cheese
IAmA,not_removed,at first you dont even realize it but when the adrenaline wears off its horrible i couldnt breathe since they punctured my right lung so they had to attach an oxygen tube
IAmA,not_removed,dead inside
IAmA,not_removed,youre asking the important questions here
IAmA,not_removed,he lost his way
IAmA,not_removed,nui seems more the type to go stabbing a person
IAmA,not_removed,ryukoryuuko
IAmA,not_removed,if he didnt call it a scissor blade
IAmA,not_removed,i came i saw i upvoted
IAmA,not_removed,ctrlf ⬆
IAmA,not_removed,typical pig in human clothing
IAmA,not_removed,dont do it kids
IAmA,not_removed,pepperoni man its a classic and thanks xd
IAmA,not_removed,every time he cuts a pizza hell have ptsd
IAmA,not_removed,hey man im sorry for the late reply if im honest i still feel panicky when im alone and someone comes close to me im always on guard now my friends have been supportive of me i think the best piece of advice they gave me was that i didnt stop trying ive never really known if i wanted to be alive but after that incident the answer was pretty much cemented in my mind now i try to be as positive as possible because if the muggers had just decided to stab me an inch or two longer i wouldve died tell your friend that its okay to feel paranoid its okay to be scared what matters is that they are safe and okay im still a bit paranoid but i try to calm myself down i have a few guidelines that i use whenever i go out never go someplace alone be at a place with many people or at least a security guard keep calm im sorry if this wasnt helpful at all have a great day
IAmA,not_removed,once they understand that random is actually random they will be able to move on
IAmA,not_removed,get a gun there is no better feeling of safety than bringing a gun to a knife fight
IAmA,not_removed,nope which is funny i saw a scissor blade but apparently the police found an ice pick so thats what was on the news c
IAmA,not_removed,i think youre a bit confused about what an ice pick actually is
IAmA,not_removed,guess these arent as common as i thought httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiicepick
IAmA,not_removed,maybe the other teens was attacked by an ice pick
IAmA,not_removed,the guys who mugged me were drug addicts they were caught the next day xd and yeah im not walking alone at night anymore c
IAmA,not_removed,never seen it i was interested in watching it though
IAmA,not_removed,i watched the whole thing because my friend told me to idk that was a really weird anime that didnt make much sense and seemed like an excuse to show girls in revealing clothing
IAmA,not_removed,im not too sure but my right lung was punctured blood was flowing into my lungs so there was a chance of me having a collapsed lung i recall the doctor telling me that my lung was flooded with blood and if it reached they would have to do an operation to drain it
IAmA,not_removed,well ive stopped staying out when its oclock or later i take a cab home now
IAmA,not_removed,nope hahaha it was finals week and i was out late studying with friends i decided to walk home xd
IAmA,not_removed,truthfully it did i was having my own mini bouts of existensial crises do i want to be alive or not was a common question on my mind
IAmA,not_removed,sounds interesting can you articulate more about traumas and realizations
IAmA,not_removed,even though the philippines has their own martial arts its easier to find a place that teaches karate judo or westernstyle boxing usually people that teach the local martial arts live in the mountains squatters or provincial towns ive found its easier to find a teacher overseas than it is in the philippines
IAmA,not_removed,imagine a pair of scissors imagine the two blades separated
IAmA,not_removed,maybe it is maybe he works for some clothing company thats plotting to take over the world
IAmA,not_removed,that weapon is literally designed after a single blade from a pair of scissors its exactly what he meant
IAmA,not_removed,not me bro xd
IAmA,not_removed,okay so i was walking home i was with friends at a local near my place so i decided to save a few coins by walking i had eaten quite a bit so i decided to burn those calories as well i had already noticed that three shady looking guys that started to tail me so inside i was already starting to feel paranoid ahead of me someone was outside of a house just smoking i assumed he lived there so i thought that if something did happen to me hed see and call for help when i walked past that guy he immediately started to walk away to the direction where i had just come from thats when the three muggers pushed me against a wall and pressed the tip of the blade on my chest i had learned later from the police chief that all three had weapons one icepick one knife and one scissor blade in my mind i was already starting to feel panic i waited for them to say something but my hands were already moving toward my phone when i had my phone in my hands they said to give it to them thats when i asked if they were gonna stab me they replied by saying if you scream well stab you so i pleaded to give me my sim card they told me to shut up and hand them my bag now my bag had my laptop and all my money in it my laptop has my entire life in it so i told them no they got pissed and threatened to stab me if i didnt give it to them so i pleaded them to just go away since they had my phone already i was already thinking of ways on how to escape but by this time they were nearly facetoface with me so i couldnt do anything they had also restricted my arms by holding it when i didnt do anything they just said just take the bag and run so they tried to pull my bag off of me and run the strap of my messenger bag had just gone over my head when they started to run i managed to grab the strap and pull on it hard the guys were thin so they were pulled backwards thats when they got mad i heard one of them curse as they pushed me onto the ground so at this time my mind went completely blank the only thing that was on my mind was dont get stabbed i thought they were just beating me up since i felt the punches and kicks at this time a car passed by and it slowed down just the tiniest bit i felt a sliver of hope as the three ran as fast as they could the man in the car didnt stop or get out of it he just drived away i grabbed my bag that they just left on the street and screamed as loud as i could for help then i put my bag on and chased them i screamed at them to stop to give me back my phone i dont know how far i chased after them but it was of considerable distance as i was chasing them a guy in a motorcycle offered to let me ride on his motorcycle and chase them i said yes but before i could hop on the guy pointed out that i was bleeding thats when my blood ran cold i lifted my shirt and there it was blood was pouring out like a tap out of my body the first thing that ran through my mind was to put pressure on it so i pressed my hand against the hole as hard as i could now this is the part where i got lucky the area where the three ran to was near a hospital so i thanked the guy on the motorcycle and just ran towards the hospital the guard at the gate saw me and opened the gates yelling at me to go to the er i burst in and all the staff and patients had stopped what they were doing and looked at me mind you at this point i still was not feeling anything then a nurse ran to me and told me to sit down he asked me what happened and i told him thats when two more nurses arrived and had me lie down on the stretcher at this point the pain had started to creep into my body tiny but piercing a doctor rushed over to me and asked if i had a relative i could contact the closest relative i had was my grandmother but she had a stroke earlier this year my sister was next but i had not memorized her number and it was about in the morning thankfully i memorized my friends number the doctor called her and thats when i asked to talk to her at this point the pain was starting to get unbearable each time i took a breath a sharp jolt of electricity ran through my body as i spoke to her it sounded like i was dying heres the thing i study out of my home town so in the time i was at the er i was alone after the call i was given oxygen through a tube and told to wait the story is a bit longer if you want to hear more tell me thanks btw d
IAmA,not_removed,tbh idk man xd
IAmA,not_removed,different xu but i am following your thought process nonetheless
IAmA,not_removed,immediately no at the hospital like a bitch
IAmA,not_removed,i was in the hospital for days but i was told to lay off anything that could get me tired for at least a month neither i felt nothing the entire time xd
IAmA,not_removed,rightie unfortunately
IAmA,not_removed,the ones for sewing
IAmA,not_removed,as a person no as a president i can find both good and bad things to say about him
IAmA,not_removed,i do but not as much as that bading ina obama
IAmA,not_removed,hes polarizing i can tell you that
IAmA,not_removed,i think he only has an ass
IAmA,not_removed,they tried to rob someone the next day thankfully a policeman was in the vicinity and caught one of them the one that was caught told the police the names of his buddies and they confessed that they were the ones who held me up
IAmA,not_removed,he said in a question above that he was pretty sure he was stabbed with a scissors blade but when the police arrested the attackers they found an ice pick the news went with the police investigations findings
IAmA,not_removed,i ran myself to a hospital xd
IAmA,not_removed,i have actually ive bought pepper spray and a comb that has a concealed blade in it im still about a gun
IAmA,not_removed,pathetic tbh i was a bitch during the whole time xd
IAmA,not_removed,i refused to give them my bag xd
IAmA,not_removed,fantastic im going to be in the next one d
IAmA,not_removed,im not afraid of scissors im afraid of anyone looking a tiny bit similar to the guys who mugged me
IAmA,not_removed,both yes and no ive always known there are horrible people in this world but i never actually thought that something bad could happen to me at this age no ones really safe from evil basically
IAmA,not_removed,the mugger since ive met pres duterte and spoke with him before xd
IAmA,not_removed,yes to the first question im somewhat paranoid when im alone but when im with friends im okay
IAmA,not_removed,couldnt speak english
IAmA,not_removed,ive been in support of carrying weapons for selfdefense although im about a gun ive already bought pepper spray and a comb that has a concealed knife in it
IAmA,not_removed,painless
IAmA,not_removed,nope
IAmA,not_removed,yes i was also prescribed antibiotics after i was discharged
IAmA,not_removed,i was admitted at a public hospital and i can describe it in two words it sucked the treatment itself was fine but the accommodations were horrid there were no private rooms since the hospital was going under renovation the first night i was place in a hallway with no proper airing the second day onward i was moved into a ward where it was hot and noisy as for payment if you have philhealth which is a government health program you can get discountsfree treatment personally i did not have a philhealth so i had to pay around £ i converted the amount i live in cagayan de oro city in mindanao ive been to manila and it is beautiful just be wary of thieves the common ones just take your stuff and run my advice keep your stuff on you or really close to you as much as possible and yes the people in the philippines lust over anyone white although im sure you are good looking xd
IAmA,not_removed,i havent been diagnosed with ptsd but i am constantly on guardparanoid about my surroundings now
IAmA,not_removed,the aftermath did
IAmA,not_removed,updated
IAmA,not_removed,scissors from what i saw the police found an ice pick and thatswhat the news reported
IAmA,not_removed,liempo
IAmA,not_removed,well i wasnt exactly taking photos while i was being threatened sorry i disappointed you
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know the exact depth but i remember i had a pneumothorax and my right lung was punctured i actually did not know i was stabbed so i only felt the pain at the hospital the only thing running through my mind was to not die at the time no it sounds weird but i was afraid of something but it wasnt death theyre currently still in jail awaiting a sentence from a judge i still have to go for trials and all that kudos on being a police officer man
IAmA,not_removed,probably not his id says ateneo de cagayan which is a university in the cagayan province in the philippines see here httpwwwxueduph
IAmA,not_removed,nope
IAmA,not_removed,im not american
IAmA,not_removed,the world is dangerous yes im not extremely paranoid but every time someone approaches me that has similar clothing or appearance i panic
IAmA,not_removed,altercation
IAmA,not_removed,whoa ive only ever truly felt adrenaline on that one incident i dont know why tbh
IAmA,not_removed,tbh idk but it was a wakeup call
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps theres talks of the death penalty bill actually becoming a law
IAmA,not_removed,what
IAmA,not_removed,this is about experiences people arent commonly around this is perfect for an ama way better than most of the celebrity ama reasons
IAmA,not_removed,there is a reason john wick uses guns and not scissors brother
IAmA,not_removed,what are you doing with your degree when you graduate
IAmA,not_removed,does your mom know you misused youre while correctly using it later on in the same sentence
IAmA,not_removed,accident
IAmA,not_removed,relevant sorry for mobile link httpmimgurcomgalleryqwkqx
IAmA,not_removed,got stabbed because of the use of xd
IAmA,not_removed,i can try
IAmA,not_removed,the motorcycle guy didnt take you to the hospital hope it was like across the street
IAmA,not_removed,thanks im surprised you chased three guys that tried to mug you adrenaline is a crazy thing glad you are ok now be safe im traveling to the philippines very soon ill avoid any dark alleys while alone
IAmA,not_removed,you chased them after they stabbed you damn dude thats badass haha
IAmA,not_removed,number rule when your getting mugged is give them your stuff and do as your told your life is more important then your items
IAmA,not_removed,did you ever get your phone back
IAmA,not_removed,i had my arm broken in in three places in a mugging myself wasnt fun
IAmA,not_removed,it felt like something was digging into my lungs was it a pair of scissors
IAmA,not_removed,being stabbed and chasing the guy is metal as fuck
IAmA,not_removed,ahhh the kick adrenaline gives makes me feel superhuman as if it turns pain off for a while
IAmA,not_removed,bliiiiiiinded by the liiiight sliced up by some douchebag in the middle of the night
IAmA,not_removed,damn that sucks
IAmA,not_removed,this is probably because of adrenaline adrenaline is a natural painkiller theres no point in feeling pain when you still have to fight or flee your attacker
IAmA,not_removed,holy shit is the philippines just full of badasses youre getting stabbed not feeling it and chasing your stabbers and your president is throwing people out of helicopters
IAmA,not_removed,i know that feel bro i was stabbed by a kabar style knife when i was

IAmA,not_removed,thank you so much for your reply i really appreciate it i think thats great advice to give yourself permission to feel everything that comes after the experience its definitely allright to not feel okay although i suppose the goal is is always going to be getting to the point where youre not held back by any fear that it sparked i love the idea of reassuring her that right now shes safe thanks again im really glad to hear youre feeling positive overall all the best wishes thanks for sharing your story
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,once you have a gun your job is to lose every fight you ever find yourself in guy pulls a knife and demands your wallet he gets your wallet your gun doesnt defend your wallet your gun defends your life thats it edit to all those internet tough guys out there going off about how the mugger really wants or needs a bullet you sound incredibly stupid by the way under bringing a gun to a knife fight will probably get you stabbed with your gun still in its holster
IAmA,not_removed,how do you know they live in a country where gun ownership is legal
IAmA,not_removed,maybe they got rid of the scissor blade
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair my default was the mountain climbing one i never remember what the actual name is
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,lets all ask trotsky
IAmA,not_removed,my humor is a little dry for you my child
IAmA,not_removed,sucks for them once duterte gets his hands on them get outta my choppa
IAmA,not_removed,honestly with duterte killing everyone i cant even believe that people still have the balls to use drugs or go anywhere near a drug dealer
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about the antidrug measures recently created by the president did this incident effect your view
IAmA,not_removed,did they end up getting killed due to the fent addicted presidents ways
IAmA,not_removed,did you stab them back at the police station after bribing the guards to look the other way
IAmA,not_removed,youre never alone with a gun on your side
IAmA,not_removed,might trigger some ptsd but in all seriousness i highly recommend it glad that youre doing alright though
IAmA,not_removed,anime dont need an excuse theres some fucked up shit out there
IAmA,not_removed,actually i loved it i thought the twists were pretty good and the whole thing about the girls in revealing clothing i was fine with because well the show didnt just make it girls in skimpy outfits just to be in skimpy outfits they gave a reason as to why it was skimpy and had the character no longer be embarrassed of it and had her treat it like normal battle armor when they had her treat it like that i started to treat it like that i became desensitized to the fact that it was skimpy as hell and just cheered for the main character like any other action anime i saw it as her battle armor rather than some sexy outfit i thought the writing for that was pretty clever to be honest
IAmA,not_removed,daaaaang how could you run after them with a pair of scissors in your lung
IAmA,not_removed,do you attempt to keep others from walking out late as well
IAmA,not_removed,did you take the finals or were your teachers understanding
IAmA,not_removed,so youd need to find the philippines version of mr miyagi huh interesting
IAmA,not_removed,im not an athletic person but i did consider it once but like thesixthvisitor said it would be more practical to pursue karatejudo since the teachers of panatukan are hard to reach
IAmA,not_removed,so basically what i imagined only less weeb and more irl
IAmA,not_removed,that was an interesting read man id love to hear more i love how you asked for your sim haha but in all seriousness fuck those guys for robbing you and fuck those guys for not stopping and offering to help maybe they didnt notice but still
IAmA,not_removed,i thoroughly enjoy reading this ama thanks
IAmA,not_removed,id like to ask though what is life in cincinnati
IAmA,not_removed,never know
IAmA,not_removed,jeeze what a bunch of assholes do you and you family have any lasting revenge feelings against these guys or are they just happy that your ok
IAmA,not_removed,interesting
IAmA,not_removed,aw im sorry
IAmA,not_removed,thanks very much that helps a lot
IAmA,not_removed,lol i was joking glad youre okay
IAmA,not_removed,very interesting i hope neither of us have to experience anything like that ever thank you stay safe
IAmA,not_removed,sorry to hear that
IAmA,not_removed,likewise why bother p
IAmA,not_removed,dont listen to that fucktard thanks for sharing your story i know you said the guys were caught but what was their sentence like how long in jail
IAmA,not_removed,no this is garbage its not much better than someone posting i just stubbed my toe ama there is nothing at all interesting about being stabbed with a scissor blade granted it isnt something that happens to people every day but that doesnt automatically make it something interesting ive had lots of experiences that dont happen every day everyone has
IAmA,not_removed,yes in the us people are injured by scissors every year and almost are killed in scissor related attacks edit meant to reply to the other guy
IAmA,not_removed,mcdonalds is always an option
IAmA,not_removed,just take out the m then its no longer a mobile link
IAmA,not_removed,it was actually if you want a map i can provide one
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man keep safe as long as you avoid those places youll be safe but always take a cab home d
IAmA,not_removed,nope sadly
IAmA,not_removed,oh you
IAmA,not_removed,cut that out
IAmA,not_removed,actually it was one scissor
IAmA,not_removed,looks like youre just introduced to the magical thing called adrenaline
IAmA,not_removed,when i broke my arm in two places i chased and fought the kid that was laughing at me adrenaline is hell of a drug would recommend
IAmA,not_removed,dont run with scissors
IAmA,not_removed,its the best thing ever i feel like i can solo the entire dark souls universe when it kicks in
IAmA,not_removed,true xd the doctors didnt even blink when i said i chased after them
IAmA,not_removed,ever watch old episodes of cops people get stabbed all the time and they almost never realize it or theyre up walking around like business as usual thats why experts always say that carrying a knife for self defense is a terrible decision as it will never stop an attack because the attacker wont know theyre wounded until way later when youre both in the hospital dying of stab wounds
IAmA,not_removed,the human body is a wonder when youre seriously injured its very common for people to not know theyve been shot blown up or even lost body parts for an alarming amount of time
IAmA,not_removed,kabar style knife whoa howd it happen
IAmA,not_removed,poland cannot into asympathetic spaceflight
IAmA,not_removed,paper is overrated
IAmA,not_removed,lol im getting fucked by it but honestly i couldnt care less i wish somebody had because i couldnt but its all okay
IAmA,not_removed,i got redditstabbed with an ice pick
IAmA,not_removed,ive got im just not spending it on any of you dorks just so you can go around spreading your shenanigans im saving it to buy a litre of cola
IAmA,not_removed,op plz
IAmA,not_removed,im so glad you said this i just felt weird that i felt no anger towards them i also feel really bad for the people who were directly involved a sister of one kept begging me to just let them go without suing them how are you btw are you hivnegative
IAmA,not_removed,sometime between a day and three months
IAmA,not_removed,four days
IAmA,not_removed,two it sounds like nothing tbh my stitches on my chin had five
IAmA,not_removed,screenshot this and post it to meirl
IAmA,not_removed,can confirm
IAmA,not_removed,rshittyama
IAmA,not_removed,or at least get a gun that doesnt require turning off the safety or manually cocking it first
IAmA,not_removed,this isnt entirely true if you pull a knife or other deadly weapon on someone in my state deadly force is justified though i will agree to losing every fight though even then you have no duty to retreat regardless of whether or not you are carrying
IAmA,not_removed,yes plus if a man with a knife is close enough to you to demand your wallet a gun will not be as useful as you think showing that a knife in close quarters will win against an holsterd gun
IAmA,not_removed,do they live in a country where mugging is legal
IAmA,not_removed,apparently in the us its referred to as a httpsenwikipediaorgwikiiceaxe didnt know that either though
IAmA,not_removed,i love michael cera
IAmA,not_removed,it isnt a joke its just that an ice pick is a tool to break chunks of ice for beverages kind of obsolete for most people but still not related to snow or mountain climbing edit its kind of like a letter opener except sharper and not flimsy
IAmA,not_removed,karma
IAmA,not_removed,its almost like killing drug users isnt the appropriate way to lower addiction rates
IAmA,not_removed,who could have predicted this would happen i mean alcohol usage totally stopped during americas prohibition
IAmA,not_removed,they use to hang people for pick pocketing crowds would come out to watch the hangings pick pockets would work the crowd for most laws increasing the punishment for the crime doesnt really reduce the number of offenders a lot people seem to commit crimes based on if they think theyll get caught or not an example of this is virginia theyve got some crazy fines for speeding people still speed in virginia because they figure they wont get caught
IAmA,not_removed,addiction is a crazy thing
IAmA,not_removed,i think im going to start killing people who dont understand that theres no way that would have had the desired effect that will make people understand right
IAmA,not_removed,personally i have mixed opinions about it it works but once a persons been branded as a drug userpusher theres almost no chance of survival my friends dad was rumoured to be a drug pusher and he was supposed to go to the local police to reform but the day before he was supposed to go he was killed in a hitandrun this incident however has changed my view two of the three had jobs and one was just a teenager who wanted to know what robbing someone felt like they stopped using drugs but instead turned to robbery perhaps the president could allot a budget towards rehab centers because theres practically none here
IAmA,not_removed,they might the trials are still ongoing
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,it was a scissor blade and they pulled it out right after they stabbed me i guess i failed to mention that it wasnt stuck in me xd
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely i also tell them to travel in groups
IAmA,not_removed,i took them a week later the teachers just said oh that sucks and had me take it after xd
IAmA,not_removed,yep
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man it kinda sucked that someone could have helped but didnt xd ill finish the story later im kind of tired d
IAmA,not_removed,thank you as well
IAmA,not_removed,i dont follow
IAmA,not_removed,not at all really were just really glad they caught them
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps i can expand in the philippines there is a common distinction between the upper class middle class and lower class i can safely say im middle class but the lower class are dominant where i live anyone that looks remotely similar to the muggersdress similarly i start to panic a tiny bit
IAmA,not_removed,its okay xd
IAmA,not_removed,hey thanks they still havent been sentenced officially but my lawyerprosecutor says they could do years since its robbery w frustrated homicide
IAmA,not_removed,your opinion personally i just wanted to share my experience and answer any questions anyone had about being stabbed d
IAmA,not_removed,ok well dont read it then

IAmA,not_removed,life pro tips want you
IAmA,not_removed,hard to select the middle of a hyperlink on a mobile device
IAmA,not_removed,did your massive balls slow you down when you chased them
IAmA,not_removed,ʢ◉ᴥ◉ʡ
IAmA,not_removed,cant wait to see the look on his face when he learns about pcp
IAmA,not_removed,not really he just said it was metal as fuck
IAmA,not_removed,woah woah dont get ahead of yourself there i bet i could finish persona in hardcore mode you die game over and you die pretty quick if you dont have a good persona when it kicks in
IAmA,not_removed,oh wow i didnt know about this thanks for the info man
IAmA,not_removed,this is why you slash dont stab its much harder to ignore if theres blood everywhere
IAmA,not_removed,i mean it depends on where you get them you could stab them times but if you miss organs and arteries they wont die now if you cut a major artery adrenaline will make it worse and the person will feel lightheaded in seconds dead in seconds to minutes
IAmA,not_removed,yeah adrenaline is a helluvadrug a mate of mine got shot in the back and didnt know it until someone said afterwards ahh bro are you alright youre bleeding from your back he was like oh shit so i am and got himself off to the hospital
IAmA,not_removed,if you get them in the neck or face then theyre definitely going to realize it
IAmA,not_removed,paper cuts itch and hurt for a whole day
IAmA,not_removed,so you are the only thing preventing your wish from being fulfilled stop standing in the way of your dreams
IAmA,not_removed,litrecola do we sell litrecola
IAmA,not_removed,dollars for liter of cola
IAmA,not_removed,here in oregon i get liters for each
IAmA,not_removed,it was latest iphone
IAmA,not_removed,did you sue anyway
IAmA,not_removed,it was actually only an hour they just cut a baby aspirin in half and gave him a flintstone vitamin and he was on his way
IAmA,not_removed,well youre not wrong
IAmA,not_removed,you know its bad when your stitches need stitches
IAmA,not_removed,yeah theyll upvote anything
IAmA,not_removed,can confirm am grim reaper
IAmA,not_removed,i think i just ded reading this can confirm reddit did more kills than any hitman
IAmA,not_removed,if a knife attacker is within like yards you wont have time to unholster a firearm and land any shots before they are upon you
IAmA,not_removed,thanks i linked that in an edit to my comment useful stuff
IAmA,not_removed,so youd rather spend life in jail than get mugged
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,youre the only one
IAmA,not_removed,almost
IAmA,not_removed,it might not be appropriate but it works
IAmA,not_removed,yeah and tl you cant even get addicted to pickpocketing
IAmA,not_removed,depends if youre efficient you will eventually kill all the people dumb enough to do drugs in an environment where the punishment is death
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps the president could allot a budget towards rehab centers because theres practically none here good on you for not supporting extrajudicial killing of people addicted to drugs
IAmA,not_removed,no worries finish it whenever you feel like
IAmA,not_removed,ahh thats good of them how would you react if this turned into a taken movie and your grandma called your phone that the muggers had and said i will find you and i will kill you xd sorry i have a wild imagination
IAmA,not_removed,buy a pepper spray a knife pitbull crowbar and youll be fine
IAmA,not_removed,its been some time just curious of the legal outcome
IAmA,not_removed,hold on i just cut my finger opening up a can ama
IAmA,not_removed,amazing
IAmA,not_removed,httpigurcogallaryqwkqx
IAmA,not_removed,httpigurcogalleryqwkqx
IAmA,not_removed,doesnt work wtf
IAmA,not_removed,well youre technically correct
IAmA,not_removed,gallary is bothering me
IAmA,not_removed,httpigurcogallaryqwkqx ftfy
IAmA,not_removed,gallary
IAmA,not_removed,let me call them c
IAmA,not_removed,they didnt thanks for asking
IAmA,not_removed,he probably wont have a face by the time hes hanging out with the pcp crowd
IAmA,not_removed,if he does pcp hell probably be introduced to something magical called duterte by magical i mean theyll make him disappear
IAmA,not_removed,this lol
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,that username tho
IAmA,not_removed,i bet i can solo it insert ludex gundyr music
IAmA,not_removed,loser of a knife fight dies in the street the winner dies in the ambulance
IAmA,not_removed,it is true agony
IAmA,not_removed,nope they sold it for parts the morning after they were caught the same afternoon
IAmA,not_removed,yes
IAmA,not_removed,thats great man i hope youre doing well
IAmA,not_removed,stitches who the hell needs stitches when you have the toughest caveman ever
IAmA,not_removed,brian regan much
IAmA,not_removed,you know what they say stitches get snitches
IAmA,not_removed,you ever ask your stitch for other stitches
IAmA,not_removed,anything edit where is the god damn karma you fucks
IAmA,not_removed,exactly this theyll be too close and will most likely attack you just cooperate also instead of a gun take some selfdefense classes from a nearby martial arts place they can teach you defense against getting stabbed also helps with your physical fitness
IAmA,not_removed,not in the free state i live in here you can use deadly force against anyone in the act of committing a felony and armed robbery is a felony also how do you know when a mugger with a knife approaches you that he intends to mug you and not stab you to death
IAmA,not_removed,sure is working when duterte himself is a fentanyl addict as told by his doctor what a joke country
IAmA,not_removed,i think his point was that their are much better ways to deal with it than simply murdering everyone who uses drugs
IAmA,not_removed,source on murdering drug addicts lowering usage and addiction rates please
IAmA,not_removed,no it doesnt
IAmA,not_removed,nope it doesnt
IAmA,not_removed,you absolutely can get addicted to stealing theres kleptomania and then you can also get addicted to the adrenaline rush you get after pickpocketing and getting away
IAmA,not_removed,i thought that until i started mainlining ground up lock picks and tumblers
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man its sad to see that my views are a minority in my country most of the people i know rave about extrajudicial killings
IAmA,not_removed,that would have been hilarious xd
IAmA,not_removed,go ahead d
IAmA,not_removed,aazing
IAmA,not_removed,spelled gallery wrong
IAmA,not_removed,fuck
IAmA,not_removed,this is really specificyou may not want to post thisjust sayin
IAmA,not_removed,honestly at the time all that was on my mind was getting my phone back it was my first smartphone ever and it was a gift from my grandma
IAmA,not_removed,i really doubt there is a pcp crowd in the phillipines drugs are really looked down upon
IAmA,not_removed,your username tho
IAmA,not_removed,wellit checks out
IAmA,not_removed,not that impressed
IAmA,not_removed,you cant not in a million years you might be able to get the monsters through the halls easily but the boss fights are always a challenge no matter what persona or what level you are even the lower bosses seem to adapt
IAmA,not_removed,yeah op got lucky this time
IAmA,not_removed,feelsbadman
IAmA,not_removed,they sold it for drugs the morning after ftfy hate this happened to you man are you working toward a profession that would allow you to carry a firearm on your person i dont know much about firearm laws in the philippines but a quick google search made it seem that only certain professions can carry firearms for self defense its a real shame your country wont let its citizens defend themselves these people could have easily killed you and you are lucky to have made it to a hospital to receive care if you would have shot them after they stabbed you i personally feel that morally you would have done the right thing low lives like these people are the reason the world is such a shit hole
IAmA,not_removed,yes im your state not everywhere else you should incapacitate not kill because in most places even in self defence you could be liable to incarceration you dont have to know which hes going to do incapacitate either way
IAmA,not_removed,we are a joke tbh
IAmA,not_removed,well if youre assuming that the individuals who raise usage and addiction rates are drug addicts would it not be logical to assume that eliminating drug addicts would lower usage and addiction rates nobody is arguing that it is in any way ethical and i think its just as vile and inhumane as the next guy but there are plenty of unethical solutions to a problem
IAmA,not_removed,well it would work because there would be less people to use the drugs because theyd be dead
IAmA,not_removed,let x be number of drug addicts where x let y be total population where x addiction rates are xy murder z drug addicts where z x addiction rates are xzy xzy xy since xz x which holds as zx and zx now we have shown that as long as equivalent to murdering someone who uses drugs murdering those who use drugs reduces addiction rates
IAmA,not_removed,yes but not fall into dependence like the case with drugs
IAmA,not_removed,just keep talking to them and try to show that addiction is a mental illness in the us we arent as bad but we still imprison addicts and dont get them the rehab and help they need but its all about progress you cant give up on trying to improve the situation
IAmA,not_removed,relevant username
IAmA,not_removed,thats just because they took out the m
IAmA,not_removed,gifts from grandma are sacred it is understandable but remember you are the best gift a grandma can ask for so stay safe
IAmA,not_removed,absolute madman
IAmA,not_removed,i bet i fucking can at least according to game mechanics just dodge dodge roll and fist repeat until victory at least with most bosses
IAmA,not_removed,im currently working to be a psychiatrist and in the far future a doctor the gun laws in the philippines are a bit constricting but with our president it should be a matter of time before he decides to legalize them thanks btw to this day i dont really know if im mad at them or myself for letting this happen to me
IAmA,not_removed,this is simply not true anywhere in the united states you never have to cower in fear or retreat from a deadly threat which a knife is you also dont have to shoot to incapacitate the police are trained to shoot for center mass and to keep shooting until the suspect drops we as citizens are afforded the same now if you live in some third world country your laws are probably more oppressive
IAmA,not_removed,it is both unethical and ineffective there is no way to know how the deaths of users and innocents will affect other people and thus affect their drug use
IAmA,not_removed,its not just unethical its doomed to be ineffective you can only ever identify a subset of drug users more people start using drugs every day duterte has already killed a couple thousand people in his drug war has it had any real impact on a country of million people no of course not hed have to kill millions to have an impact it would be a holocaust not gonna happen singapore and indonesia have extraordinarily harsh drug laws people still break them most dont get caught so while in an ideal world you might just kill all the drug users and bring the addiction rate to zero thats just not possible in reality
IAmA,not_removed,see my other comment about why that doesnt work i know youre joking but still for any other readers
IAmA,not_removed,you didnt take in to consideration the addition of new drug addicts and dealers please update formula
IAmA,not_removed,and wheres your part of the proof that shows that each drug user killed may cause their friends and family use more or basically any other social variable that we havent studied yet parents killed for smoking weed means kids growing up orphaned thus higher addiction rates in them its not like you can remotely kill them all anyway and theres no guarantee that anyone killed is an actual user plus you know the whole moral issue of it all and how murder is wrong
IAmA,not_removed,that oversimplification looks all nice and neat on paper but reality is a bitch you can only ever identify a subset of drug users new addicts arrive every day so yes while killing some drug users now technically has some small temporary effect the actual magnitude of change is not likely to be significant and is also subject to diminishing returns as you run out of identifiable addicts to kill andor society turns against your holocaust
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think you quite understand what an addiction actually is people become dependent on nondrug related fixations all the time sex addicts food addicts kleptomaniacs etc im sure you can weird find ones that dont have a specific name too were talking about people who literally despite better judgment simply cant tear themselves away from their addiction due to how theyve come to lean on it and depend on it as a structure in their lives respectively these people can turn into completely socially dysfunctional people the terminally obese or may continually accrue thousands to tens of thousands of dollars damaging their relationships with their family and their ability to support themselves financially all ruining their livelihood just because they cant detach themselves from these mental addictions addiction and dependence arent restricted to putting bad stuff in your body anything that someone can fixate themselves on can become an unhealthy obsession without sufficient restraint
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for the advice we have protest and seminars here discussing the effects of these ejk on the people that belong to the lowerclass people attend and its refreshing to see peoples views change
IAmA,not_removed,relevant usernae
IAmA,not_removed,i always forget the silent m in gallmery
IAmA,not_removed,and cause i just copy pasted woops
IAmA,not_removed,and cause i just copy pasted woops
IAmA,not_removed,yea i had a awesome old harmonica gifted to me by grampa that was stolen among other things wasnt the most expensive item but it made me feel the worst
IAmA,not_removed,thanks man d
IAmA,not_removed,i read this in an old lady voice
IAmA,not_removed,i dont want to get into deep details but i have been robbed like times and one was a house invasion dont blame yourself as there was really nothing you could have done during the house invasion i even had a gun in my dresser but that doesnt help you much when you wake up to a gun in your face just be thankful your attackers got caught because mine never didid be lying if i said its easy to get over because to this day i still wake up in the night paranoid when i hear a noise just try to let the paranoia be an advantage
IAmA,not_removed,last time i looked the uk and the majority of europe are not third world countries but its illegal here also pretty sure its illegal in most of asia also and australia
IAmA,not_removed,its year algebra man do it yourself
IAmA,not_removed,i totally agree but the satirical proof above should drive the point home maybe i chose the wrong media for the wrong audience
IAmA,not_removed,i was talking about physical dependence as in you need an external source of a substance to keep yourself from going on withdrawal i guess thats my fault for not being clear on that
IAmA,not_removed,now watch me whip now watch me usernae nae

IAmA,not_removed,sometimes we lose things sometimes we lose people but if were lucky its the memories we get to keep keep the kind present as a memory it physically wont last forever but the love that your grandpa has for you will
IAmA,not_removed,nothing wrong with that as long as it makes you happy
IAmA,not_removed,oh that sucks im sorry to hear that thats great advice actually thank you keep safe man i hope youre doing well
IAmA,not_removed,any nation that requires you to die rather than to defend your own life in my opinion is a third world country strick gun laws does not reduce gun violence chicago has very strict gun laws and top of the list for gun violence
IAmA,not_removed,he cant edit your comment banana man
IAmA,not_removed,no youre all good its just with reddit being the way it is you never know good to clarify for any passing readers haha
IAmA,not_removed,checking in here for spotify updates and that constitution stuff sounds important too
IAmA,not_removed,he still retains the title of president even after his term has ended
IAmA,not_removed,what was your biggest mileage day on the at what iswas your favorite piece of backpacking gear least favorite
IAmA,not_removed,hi tim could you describe the feelings you had on your way to vietnaam back in the day what were your standpoints of the war
IAmA,not_removed,whats the biggest meal you ate on your hike
IAmA,not_removed,what is your funniest story from your time in vietnam and also the at what unit were you with in vietnam
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel about foreign intervention after being in vietnam when is it appropriate if ever
IAmA,not_removed,how much money did you need to have saved to hike the at
IAmA,not_removed,hi tim thank you for doing this ive got two questions serious is there still something in life that scares you and what is it not so serious is your son single
IAmA,not_removed,hi tim thank you for doing the ama man after hiking the entire at going back to vietnam and now finishing a memoir what did you find the most rewarding why
IAmA,not_removed,although there may not be many did you have a best time or favoritegood memory while in vietnam besides getting to go home
IAmA,not_removed,what was your favorite bit of the at did you have a trail name or any fun experiences on it that youd like to share also thank you for service and for being brave enough to return that takes a lot of guts congratulations on everything youve achieved it takes hard work and dedication to do what you have
IAmA,not_removed,hi tim what is the perfect mixture of ingredients for a prairie fire
IAmA,not_removed,first off thank you very much for your service secondly how difficult was it to return to normal life after fighting in vietnam
IAmA,not_removed,ive always wanted to walk the ap trail but life is always in the way whats the good and bad of it
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your service and congratulations on both the documentary and book i aspire to be able to express myself as you have out of all the accomplishments you have listed which are you most proud of why which of those was most difficult to see through thank you
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for posting this tim two questions was there ever a point at which you almost gave up on your hike and what was the most memorable moment of your return to vietnam
IAmA,not_removed,how did you get over the shell shock
IAmA,not_removed,what kind of shoes and clothing do you recommend for the at
IAmA,not_removed,i have been around through hikers a fair amount and a lot of them seem to be veterans and maybe veterans are overrepresented in the group of people that through hike is there a veteran community within the normal through hiker community do you think there is something specifically attractive to veterans about hiking the at as a personal anecdote i have always loved the fact that the us has been fairly good about making peace with former enemies japan and germany stand out but vietnam is often overlooked it was a protracted bloody and demoralizing war that falls in the loss category by almost all definitions
IAmA,not_removed,would like to come hike with me out in the desert in moab

IAmA,not_removed,hi tim i had a question about your ptsd after returning from vietnam you had mentioned support from family and friends helped get you through it initially was there any government programs available at the time today there is much public support for oifoef veterans and the va generally does a terrific job of finding therapists to help veterans deal with issues plus there are the suicide prevention booklets we get with phone numbers and other general information so my question isdid the government have anything similar available to veterans in the late and into the

IAmA,not_removed,i was scared as was every gi on our plane i was very non political and didnt really pay much attention to the news i just thought i was doing the right thing because my dad was a wwii vet i never thought my country would lie to meus of course i learned to loathe war lost so many brothers
IAmA,not_removed,at the homeplace in slabs of roast beef pieces of chicken three orders of mashed potatoes and gravy lots of vegies rolls desert lemonades ice teas waters chocolate milks
IAmA,not_removed,when a fellow soldier saved bunches of bugs in a can then ate them all before we went on a combat assault it sure got our minds off what was to come the at when a fellow hiker thought he was eating from a cooler that was trail magic it turned out to be a construction workers lunch we were in hanover nh the trail cuts through this town
IAmA,not_removed,never liked it we occupy way too many countries those who start wars never fight them those who fight them never like them
IAmA,not_removed,i wish i could give you an exact figure on that i would say could get it done maybe a bit more you can freeze dry food before you head out but every once in a while you may want to get off ther trail and hitch into town shower a bed a cold beer good food it is life changinggo for it
IAmA,not_removed,all war scares me i feel for the participants and the civilians son is single but in love he is adorable isnt he
IAmA,not_removed,that is a very good question all were epic for me the at and all its miles were beautiful back to vietnam helped me immensely as i remembered my friends and made peace with my enemy the memoir was the culmination of both i wanted to get it out for other vets and possible thru hikers in the world
IAmA,not_removed,going on rr to australia was big i had a day rr i turned into days didnt even get into trouble the camaraderie with the fellas was so very special we protected each other a family really which made it difficult when we lost someone
IAmA,not_removed,for a section hiker i would say the shenandoahs lots of wildlife to be seen the white mountains in nh maine was my favorite state but the entire trail has its own beautytrail name of naneek so many experiences i have logged in the book so many special moments thank you for your kind words peace

IAmA,not_removed,the day i got back i knew i wasnt normal i have no idea the person i would have been had i not been in a year of combat at but i am grateful and i think fun is the key to being normal
IAmA,not_removed,the good of the at the people on and off the trail the bad wiping my ass with snow because i ran out of tp chaffing occurred you can read about all my experiences in the good hike peace
IAmA,not_removed,hiking the at was a huge accomplishment for me it gave me inner peace and i ended up going back to vietnam i had been leery of the woods going back to vietnam and meeting my former enemy only enhanced that feeling there is so much good in the world
IAmA,not_removed,my mentor made me promise i would do days before quitting i understand why i wanted to pack it in early because it was so hard for me physically but i pushed on and got my trail legs under me the hike was life changing memorable momenttwo thingsmeeting a former enemy and us accepting each another knowing we do things in war we would never do in life second returning to hill and remembering my friends and the enemy who lost their lives
IAmA,not_removed,talking with friends and family was a huge support ptsd never truly goes away the more goodness in my life the better i feel
IAmA,not_removed,i used vasque shoes rugged jagged rocks out there these shoes protected me clothing patagonia or smartwool something that dries easily and is light
IAmA,not_removed,i dont know of a veteran community when i hiked i didnt meet many none former infantry i have read about vet groups from iraq and afghanistan hiking together that sounded like a healing and good thing i dont know how you win or lose a war most of the people that are killed and wounded are civilians the vietnamese people were extremely kind to me when i visited in and we devastated their country thanks for your comments peace someday
IAmA,not_removed,that sounds beautiful i am heading to mexico in weeks
IAmA,not_removed,i was in the army mos was infantry wasnt supposed to be but when i ended up with my division they were shorthanded infantry bad break for me
IAmA,not_removed,i dont quite recall if i was there i did hike thru pa but was in the woods most of the time i will hike sections of the at again but probably not thru hike the at is part of my life i hold it dear to my heart
IAmA,not_removed,the only country other than vietnam i have traveled in is mexico i go to a little town sayulita for about months a year my hobby is volleyball i coached for years i played for longer still play in my age group in the nationals each year
IAmA,not_removed,get good equipment your journey will be so much more pleasurable dont pack what you dont need be comfortable keep your sleeping bag dry
IAmA,not_removed,i have spoken at many events in the past because our film naneek was in several film festivals i also did presentation on the at and all its beautyand what the journey did for me mentally and emotionally thank you for suggesting this peace
IAmA,not_removed,i am a member of a veterans group that opposes war i went back to vietnam and met other north vietnamese army soldiers those that i fought against back in the day very healing good people
IAmA,not_removed,dont let you dreams be dreams have patience and move forward too many people want it all now you will find yourself but dont sit stagnant engage peace
IAmA,not_removed,i did what i had to do at the time i had no idea what war was all about until i was in one nobody knows the intensity and horror of war unless they experience it all politiians should experience it before they simply vote and send us off and then later are so sad when we come back in a body bag
IAmA,not_removed,i think this is the case with all wars of which we are involved the politicians that send us to war have no idea the intensity and horror their children do not go to battle we have bombed countries since wwii it is always about money ringo always peace
IAmA,not_removed,nothing back then just go home and be good but many of combat vets and others would never be the same i think even still not enough is done to take care of our vets who suffered there are so many suicides we do private fundraisers to raise money for new beds at walter reed that should never be an issue for our wounded vets
IAmA,not_removed,yes very emotional i dont think i could have pulled it off without the support of my son he seemed to know when i was having problems i would recommend the journey to any vet the people in vietnam are so forgiving and have wonderful attitudes as they relate to life thank you for your kind words
IAmA,not_removed,cant answer all of these because i dont want to get into politics probably a on patriotic i love this country but sometimes disagree with policyi was in the army rank of sp i was an rto in vietnami have my medals and citations nothing elseboot camp was a drag for me i was way out of shapeuplifting stories are pretty much non existent war was not uplifting the friends met were super human beings we trusted each otheri loved meeting the nva they were cold initially but warmed to me we even did a prairie fire i then met one of them separately before i came home that was the highlight of my journey all in the book support war i dont know i would have to truly know we were helping and not hurting hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians have died as a result of our bombs i dont like that thank you for all your questions
IAmA,not_removed,look for good light gear if you are in bad shape physically i would work my way back into shape before taking on the trail not that you have to be elite just some kind of in shape then you take it slow as you start off until you get your trail legs under you
IAmA,not_removed,no tell him about it both the film and the book are for vets trying to get a handle on issues i would tell him i would bet he would appreciate it some vets choose not to talk about it i dont know many perhaps because i am one and like to engage
IAmA,not_removed,i have been to the wall very moving almost like being at a funeral very solemn i found friends names remembered them i was emotional they were all good people with families and friends just like you and i
IAmA,not_removed,this is a very hard question for me to answer in a short paragraph i tried to write about vietnam for years but coiuldnt get by certain events and battles after hiking the at and returning to vietnam i was able to put my thoughts down on paper hence i wrote a book it was good for me to get it down on paper losing my friends never escapes my mind fear follows combat vets
IAmA,not_removed,somewhat of a bummer for sure i try to focus myself on all the good folks in the world those people you refer to arent worth our energy
IAmA,not_removed,fundamentally solid
IAmA,not_removed,not really i try not to go there it seems our country likes to engage in the idea of occupying lord knows we have bombed different countries since wwii war is a big part of our budget
IAmA,not_removed,dont quite understand this question
IAmA,not_removed,i am a former volleyball coach an artist who played for me gave me a map of the world very creative most backwards that was back in i loved that gift
IAmA,not_removed,im going to add a question mark to the following pasted comment based on the rules fair enough i wish you were in my area because ive got nothing ive survived deployments to afghanistan and wish i wouldnt my family doesnt understand because my wife is from a nonmilitary family and my brother is the perfect army angel i think im already making a bad name for me but im rocky i added the goddman question mark and i want to hike the appalachian trail are you happy reddit bots
IAmA,not_removed,maine was my favorite state maybe because of its beauty maybe because of the great weather i had maybe because i was so close to completion i love maine but you can pick any part of the trail and enjoy beauty and serenity and you wont get lost folow the white blazes
IAmA,not_removed,maine was my favorite state the white mountains of new hampshire the shenendoahs in va every state is beautiful in its own way loved it all mostly loved all the people on and off the trail that supported us
IAmA,not_removed,i would never set up camp at the bottom of a hill a vietnam thing perseverance and determination i learned as an infantry soldier i did become determined to finish the at after i hiked miles or so barring injury i was going the distance i thought to myself many timesi survived a year in a combat zone i can do this and i can do this for friends lost
IAmA,not_removed,grew to love herbut not so much when i was in vietnam
IAmA,not_removed,dont quite know what you are referring to i am new to this gig
IAmA,not_removed,if i didnt use something for a week i sent it home great philosophy
IAmA,not_removed,i did a section hike of the at this year through the smokies and wrote a book about my experience too im not too keen on hiking the entire trail but i would like to do more section hiking along some of the better parts what was your favorite section of the trail to hike
IAmA,not_removed,did you meet forest gump
IAmA,not_removed,beautiful thank you for this also i totally agree with the beginning of the day bit i intentionally wake up two hours before i need to so i can have time to myself and to ease into the day
IAmA,not_removed,great message to live by
IAmA,not_removed,the problem is that many americans treat their brothers sisters and children like shit
IAmA,not_removed,my friend has a place right by the at in virginia and every time i visit i bring fruit beer water and sandwich ingredients which we put in a cooler with some ice at one of the stops what other things could we put in there that a through hiker would enjoy
IAmA,not_removed,lyndon johnson at least served in back in those days there were a lot of vets in congress if only because of conscription nowadays only poor people and military brats enlist
IAmA,not_removed,theres no real preparation for a post pf shot
IAmA,not_removed,dont forget puds pointless up and downs on the trail
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your response i plan on beginning my military career here soon so that definitely helps the fears of ptsdtrauma etc its a problem that will likely arise but there are always ways to handle it and remind yourself of the good in the world just have to find what works for you thats how i feel at least i wish you the best thank you again
IAmA,not_removed,i watched the ww ii series on pbs and one of the wives husband said the way they got over it was by sitting out on the front porch with their wives and couple friends and talking about it i met a year old guy from the battle of the bulge he said it took a long time his complaint was that his wife never initiates conversation good luck what do you think about meditation
IAmA,not_removed,thank you sir much appreciated
IAmA,not_removed,pedal for ptsd is a good group from what ive seen
IAmA,not_removed,excuse me for asking but what is shorthanded infantry
IAmA,not_removed,yeah walter reed was all kinds of jacked up the wrong doings were finally made public five or six years ago its good to see youre still involved with other veterans
IAmA,not_removed,and thank you for your service sir but i asked about uplifting war stories because ive read about some soldiers and marines in iraq and afghanistan whove had a positive relationship with the locals but yes youre right war is not pretty
IAmA,not_removed,i guess he is trying to ask what made you realize what technological advances have now become a daily reality
IAmA,not_removed,and its very interesting to look at thank you for the answer
IAmA,not_removed,im piggybacking onto your comment because op is not answering questions right now check out team rubicon usa a group of returning veterans who deploy to disasters here and in the world they are now regional and a dedicated band of men and women i think you will find kinship among those hardcore volunteers i have supported this organization because they have filled a void for those struggling to find community no questions asked please check them out
IAmA,not_removed,what area are you in have you tried mtn biking similar results from hiking to bikingclears the mindbrings peace to your well being biking is the only thing that calms my anger
IAmA,not_removed,what is the most near death experience that you had at vietnam
IAmA,not_removed,all were beautiful in there own way i had few dull moments i liked the shenandoahas because of the wildlife the white mountains of new hampshiremaine is beautiful keep doing sections until you complete the entire trail my hats off to you
IAmA,not_removed,i was looking for him
IAmA,not_removed,you are welcome dont forget the smile
IAmA,not_removed,maybe i should have said someone close to them someone they truly love if all people treated everyone like someone they love we would have peace way less destruction
IAmA,not_removed,you are hitting it right you are thru hikers dream i thank you from all of us sugar stuffi always rewarded myself with a candy bar of some sort when i summited some mountain
IAmA,not_removed,i appreciate your comments i didnt like seeing my friends die violently i would never want my children to go through what i went through i was forever thinking of a reason we were out there doing our duty i think we were just trying to survive not appropriate we were in iraq glad you are safe
IAmA,not_removed,this is interesting to me what did you enjoy about it
IAmA,not_removed,your claim of only poor people and military brats enlist is false
IAmA,not_removed,nowadays only civilians make sweeping claims about the military
IAmA,not_removed,no there isnt but it seems women handle them better than men
IAmA,not_removed,you are welcome be safe
IAmA,not_removed,meditation is a good thing quiet serene
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for your kind words peace
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for this
IAmA,not_removed,i think he meant they needed infantry so thats why he ended up in infantry
IAmA,not_removed,not really surebut i would assume shorthanded is like we were my entire tour of vietnam never at full strength
IAmA,not_removed,they needed men
IAmA,not_removed,angry for years getting on the at helped going back to vietnam helped writing about it helped my friends and family helped
IAmA,not_removed,never payed much attention to technology i dont like that texting is the gig nowadays people dont do the one on one personal face to face chats like they used to they dont even talk on the phone to one another how can people really bond that way
IAmA,not_removed,tldr
IAmA,not_removed,you probably meant to ask this question not me
IAmA,not_removed,smiles and hugs are renewable resources
IAmA,not_removed,i find this whole thread very interesting because i saw on cnn where a veteran started an appalachian trail hiking program specifically for ptsd and to help transition vets home it was very cool must be something about hiking ❤️
IAmA,not_removed,tldr is basically my question but its ok im happy you even responded
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think us oef vets really saw the same casualty counts that vietnam vets saw that might change your perspective i enjoyed my time down range too but if had lost more close friends i might feel differently about it our platoon only had two wia
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps one time war will come to your country so your children can enjoy the excitement of it too
IAmA,not_removed,i saw that as well i think it is just getting out there with no distractions and letting yourself think about your situation where you have been what you plan to do with yourself perhaps forgive we do things in war we would never do as a normal human being
IAmA,not_removed,i think its outside in nature in generaltheres a fb page called pedal for ptsd that does alot of support rides and long distance rides with vets to help combat the effects of ptsd im an avid mtn biker as well and joined there group to support these guys
IAmA,not_removed,rasktrumpsupporters
IAmA,not_removed,what is your viewpoint on low fat vs low carbhigh fat diets
IAmA,not_removed,what are the benefits of yoga
IAmA,not_removed,so one of the contributors to the obesity epidemic is that so many of our convenience foods are high in carbs potato chips french fries candy big hamburger and hot dog buns fast food noodle and rice bowls etc what do you recommend to replace those quick convenience foods with
IAmA,not_removed,i have recently started calorie counting in an effort to eliminate some stubborn belly fat i have been meeting my daily goals offered by the ua myfitnesspal app for days now and have lost almost pounds however i am not really seeing any of that loss come out of the fat furthermore i am afraid that the weight i have lost has almost been exclusively muscle which is aggravating considering i am a reasonably lean build and i have to work pretty hard in the gym to keep what little lean muscle mass i have is there a way that i can trigger my body to burn fat stores instead of muscle
IAmA,not_removed,is there a particular asana you would recommend for losing belly fat
IAmA,not_removed,are there good online resources to help with choosing the right foods to eat and which foods to avoid thanks
IAmA,not_removed,what is your opinion on diet soda
IAmA,not_removed,with body fat being a regulated tissue it appears long term weight loss without struggling is very difficult research indicate this is partly due to the various homeostatic mechanisms many of which we are still discovering at play throughout the body my question given the current state of obesity research what is your opinion on the future of obesity and its treatment do subscribe to any journals if so what is your favorite who is your favorite obesity researcher or group of researchers that you follow what university do you believe is cutting edge in research in this area
IAmA,not_removed,hi so im way late to this but i thought id comment anyway i had a baby girl months ago is there anything i can do health or exercise wise that will help my body become stronger again i eat relatively healthy anyway and im going back to ballet class tomorrow any food recommendations for a month old
IAmA,not_removed,i have really bad feet issues which prevent me from walking running or standing for a good amount of time ive recently been gaining weight and although i do push ups and sit ups and lifting dumbells for mins a day what are some more ways i could lose weight faster any specific workouts for someone with my feet problems specific foods all i drink is water every day i drink about bottles of water and rarely do i drink soda im and around pounds if that helps 😊
IAmA,not_removed,let me address the standard elephant in the room whenever talking to someone who purports to offer nutritional advice do you advocate a plantonly diet in general do you advocate a ketogenic diet in general do you advocate veganism in general do you advocate glutenfree in general do you advocate supplements in general
IAmA,not_removed,low fat diets clearly dont work unless you have a medical condition that necessitates following one think back to the lowfat craze that led our country to consume massive amounts of carbs and contributed to the obesity epidemic however we still need some carbs and certain people need more than others carbohydrates contain important vitamins like bs and are our bodys quickest energy source especially to fuel our brain power rather than focus solely on the amount of carbs fat its equally important to consider the quality and type of foods that make up these macronutrients in your diet healthy foods with fat like avocados nuts nut butters are key and carbs that are rich in fiber and essential nutrients and protein are best focus on building a balanced plate with veggies protein carbohydrate these carbs can be starchy veggies like sweet potato it all comes down to finding what is the best ratio of nutrients for you personally and this may change depending on your personal context
IAmA,not_removed,there are so many benefits of yoga heres a quick list immunity stress management fitness strength training to build muscle and lean body mass calorie burn did you know that you can continue to burn the same amount of calories you were expending during your yoga class for about an hour after it ends strong bones yoga helps you preserve bone density with aging due to the strength aspects of practice less aches pains like helping to alleviate low back pain these are just a few
IAmA,not_removed,giant can of unsalted mixed nuts has worked wonders for me for the last several years to stay away from other junk
IAmA,not_removed,absolutely you are so on the money with this one one of the best and most convenient forms of healthy carbs are fresh fruits lettuce wraps in place of buns there are some pretty cool pastas that are packed with protein and lower in carbs like those that are quinoalentil based vs wheat
IAmA,not_removed,youre not alone in your frustrations in fact i hear this all the time from clients here are a few ways i would unpack this many tools like myfitnesspal may generalize calorie goals rather than using your personal information to get the best target its about more than just your height weight age gender all calories are not created equal a diet of calories of nutrientdeplete fast food not that youre eating that will produce different metabolic results than calories of minimally processed nutrientrich foods body composition is about more than just counting calories and this level of complexity is hard to find in most apps its fantastic that youre including fitness there are many benefits to help trigger your body to burn off fat vs muscle here are some keys include healthy fats like avocado nuts certain oils eat a varied diet rich in plantbased foods make sure youre getting enough calories to support a healthy metabolism drink plenty of water
IAmA,not_removed,one of the many reasons i love to practice yoga is for the core strength which means help in burning belly fat balance poses and flowing through vinyasa sun salutations are excellent choices chaturanga dandasana is an excellent choice
IAmA,not_removed,yes lots of good options out there but absolutely important to have a discerning eye ultimately the right foods and those to avoid are individual but overall check out these reliable resources harvard school of public health httpswwwhsphharvardedunutritionsource dana farber cancer institute nutrition wwwdanafarberorgnutrition environmental working group wwwewgorg also im the chief wellness officer at a new startup called ava that gives you real time personalized suggestions and can better guide you on the right foods for you and those to limit right now ava is still in private beta but today you can use this code if you want to give it a try text ama to to get started now or
IAmA,not_removed,i do not have a high opinion of diet sodas in fact its one of the few foodsbeverages that truly should be avoided not only is there zero benefit to drinking them there are risks that many people are unaware of research shows that drinking diet sodas can actually hinder weight loss plus contribute to insulin resistance and high blood pressure risk that may sound counter intuitive given that there are no calories but this is precisely why we have to look beyond calories to get a clear picture aside from additives preservatives and other processed ingredients the hypersweetness of diet soda is linked to some of these health issues harvard school of public health found that many people who drink diet soda end up consuming the same amount of or even more calories they slashed from their beverage in other foods in part because these drinks can be times sweeter
IAmA,not_removed,i am happy to see youre well read on this topic excellent discussion and given the fact that of our adult population in the us is either overweight or obese and out of every children are according to the cdc it is a crucial subject to address while treatment is key prevention will emerge as our best way to address the burden on our population for journals i use pubmed all the time to seek peer reviewed research rather than subscribe to paper copies of specific journals ive shifted to online and appreciate the ability to read from so many beyond oncology society of integrative onc journal of clinical onc medicine amer journal of public health jama for ex and nutrition american j of clinical nutrition for ex i also read journals on exercise from acsm tufts university here in boston and in particular dr susan roberts lab in energy metabolism are at the head of leading research in obesity of course there are many other wonderful researchers and institutions working to help everyday people live a happier and healthier life
IAmA,not_removed,hi glad youve reached out definitely not too late congrats on your baby girl ballet class is an excellent choice for strength postpartum yoga and mombaby yoga is also wonderful for helping rebuild core strength and support your metabolism if you are continuing to breastfeed to any extent this can help as well walking as much as possible wearing your baby ideally can do wonders for your body mind and connection to your daughter that includes wearing your baby during light housework and as much as possible i used to use my babys like a medicine ball and safely of course do some fun and silly weight work holding them for example chest press walking lunges here are more ideas httpwwwrebootwithjoecomturnyourerrandsintoexercise for foods it would help to know what youve tried with her so far before commenting feel free to share and im happy to comment
IAmA,not_removed,sorry to hear great job on the water and avoiding soda to help lose weight when you cant be as active as youd like tracking can be a big help and focusing on a plantbased diet with lots of fruitsveggies give ava a try with our free code ama for this awesome group youre doing great with strength training add in new exercises or slow down your reps or use slightly heavier weights to keep reaping benefits walking even in limited and slow amounts will be immensely helpful for preventing gaining weight while youre on the mend do what you can for short bouts maybe times a day wishing you a speedy recovery
IAmA,not_removed,love this question truly there is no one size fits all approach an adaptive customized personalized path and plan is always the way to go icymi you can grab the code i put up above to try out ava i support plantbased diets of all kinds including only plants plantbased diets whether they are plants or mostly plants are clearly the healthiest and best for energy fitness and more i do not advocate a traditional or technical ketogenic diet for most people working in the past with kids suffering from seizures there are clear benefits for some an adapted keto diet thats lower in carbs and that includes healthy fats vs loads of processed meats would be the way to go for anyone wanting to give it a try see my answer to question i absolutely support vegan diets but it is not something that everyone must follow everyday plantbased diets can take on many forms personally i follow a glutenfree diet however it is helpful for many but not necessary for all happy to get into more details with you thanks
IAmA,not_removed,yes excellent choice
IAmA,not_removed,a typical day for me looks like this breakfast applesauce and cottage cheese lunch turkeycheese sandwiches with some low fat spread on wheat or rye bread fruit grapes apples etc dinner usually grilled chicken or steak served with a few side vegetables liters of water not a typo i drink water almost constantly per day snacks unsalted nuts any immediate suggestions youd make to that sounds like maybe try to add more vegetables
IAmA,not_removed,vinyasa sun salutations are excellent choices is it that surya namaskar asana
IAmA,not_removed,thank you for responding i should apologize for my poor grammar and proof reading it was very late
IAmA,not_removed,hi thanks super helpful info here and wow you sure are hydrating careful with your exercise that youre not over watering and lacking electrolytes l is a gallon which is great see if that end of the range helps for foods yes i would suggest adding in more vegetables also avoid low fat products and go for the real thing in particular avocado guac hummus may be a good choice for your sandwich if you have risks or concern around gluten intolerance that can lead to some bloating and belly fat too so thats something else to explore
IAmA,not_removed,yes exactly you got it
IAmA,not_removed,thanks so much for all the useful information
IAmA,not_removed,happy to help feel free to give ava a try and see how that works for you text ama to to get started now or
IAmA,not_removed,do not make this ama about political sides keep to the facts not about waging a war honestly that ama is a crashandburn trainwreck waiting to happen no facts will be mentioned and it will turn into a spewing political hate soup
IAmA,not_removed,what can we do to stop trump holytalk about a loaded question
IAmA,not_removed,dear ama mods please start deleting assholish comments from any side
IAmA,not_removed,really a shame that these questions are framed in such a biased manner if anyone could have shown a lack of bias it would have been a former attorney general and so they should be treated as such
IAmA,not_removed,how do you feel that now you will be in the guinness world record to be listed as the shortest term us cabinet member january january
IAmA,not_removed,hey look another tell me how im right and everyone else is wrong ama request obligatory i didnt vote for trump i just find these kind of loaded ama requests annoying defense
IAmA,not_removed,come on none yall even knew who sally yates was up until hours ago
IAmA,not_removed,lmao
IAmA,not_removed,do people know what acting means
IAmA,not_removed,this would be fascinating though im not optimistic
IAmA,not_removed,the lack of knowledge on what the role of certain government officials is is quite shocking either redditors flunked grade social studies or there are a lot of foreigners making comments that have no idea that the attorney general is a president appointed cabinet position that can be replaced as the president pleases its shocking how many people dont understand this also sally yates was appointed by obama she was not going to be in that position for more than a month or so
IAmA,not_removed,why do you think the eo is against the constitution
IAmA,not_removed,why is she getting all this attention she was out in a week she knew exactly what she was doing and now it sets her up for a run at political office a judgeship in a future democrat administration or a million dollar a year job at a law firm
IAmA,not_removed,why is it when obama asks you to do something illegal you do it and supporters didnt care but if trump asks you to do something something obama also had you do now it was wrong how to you reconcile the difference when the leadership changed but a request was the same even less than the illegal stuff obama had you do
IAmA,not_removed,why didnt you stand up to obama when he issued the same sort of visa stay in against iraqis for six months
IAmA,not_removed,this comment section is just disappointing
IAmA,not_removed,seriously i cannot think of any previous cabinet member that disobeyed the executive order of a potus hailed as hero
IAmA,not_removed,sally youre an american hero
IAmA,not_removed,yeah like she has the time or idea to be on reddit after getting canned for defending the constitution 😒
IAmA,not_removed,why do you feel your politcal opinions are more important than enforcing the law
IAmA,not_removed,heres a good question my employer expected me to do my job and i didnt so he fired me how can i play the victim and get reddit to circlejerk over me
IAmA,not_removed,your chance to stop trump was back in november and you lost get over it
IAmA,not_removed,like you i dont want to do my job can you tell me how to get fired while still being treated like a hero by bunch of morons in the mainstream media
IAmA,not_removed,thanks for your service did you discuss or attempt to discuss the eo with potus prior to issuing your insubordinate order did you tender your resignation to potus prior to issuing your insubordinate order if so what was the result of that discussion
IAmA,not_removed,rephrased for accuracy ama request anything that will allow me to keep overdramatizing the president
IAmA,not_removed,not just pretend theyll call you a liar if you mention them some go so far as to say obamas policies which killed arguably tens of thousands were a net benefit while a simple immigration halt is somehow worse
IAmA,not_removed,she most assuredly cannot talk about specifics right now pending any legal action plus protection of state secrets
IAmA,not_removed,go to work today and refuse to do youre job see what happens she also is boardering treason imo
IAmA,not_removed,now that she has plenty of time lololol
IAmA,not_removed,nobody wants to hear from her im so thankful she was fired she absolutely needed to go
IAmA,not_removed,man you people really want a civil war this division is without question damaging the country more than trump ever will edit if youre against people wanting a united country youre probably part of a hate group
IAmA,not_removed,how is the unemployment line you traitor cunt say fu to obama and killary for us
IAmA,not_removed,how does it feel to get the youre fired treatment from the god emperor of mankind
IAmA,not_removed,can always count on td to brigade a thread with sally yates in the title must be their new trigger word
IAmA,not_removed,what was it like being ag for days
IAmA,not_removed,do you find it ironic that it was jeff sessions who asked you how you would react in exactly this situation at your confirmation hearing
IAmA,not_removed,how will you make a living now that trump has signed a five year ban on lobbying for all his cabinet staff or is that unconstitutional too
IAmA,not_removed,i wanna know if trump did his little hand gesture like he did on the apprentice when he said youre fired
IAmA,not_removed,oh good another default sub with an openly leftist agenda this site is such an absolute shit hole
IAmA,not_removed,she makes more money and will make more money than anyone in this thread lmfao how do you reddit expect to help her other than making more posts about antidjt
IAmA,not_removed,hey its me sally been a hectic few days im sure you can imagine lol but im happy to answer some questions i dont agree with them take a vacation set up a gofundme page in my honor not much i dont know
IAmA,not_removed,no question just a sincere thank you for doing what is right even though i am sure you knew you would pay a heavy price i wish the democrats has as much spine as you have shown good luck
IAmA,not_removed,i would like to know what she thinks about the horrors of male mutilation on the public
IAmA,not_removed,how does a cow manage to get into office the way you did i ask because i work on a dairy farm and i know some heifers that would be just as useful if not moreso than you lets face it they make milk and youre just a tool might have them take a stab at your job
IAmA,not_removed,i dont understand how people are surprised by this she acted against the president of the united states that is an act of treason
IAmA,not_removed,fuck her you refuse to do your job leave
IAmA,not_removed,cucked anti democratic disgusting socialist
IAmA,not_removed,maga
IAmA,not_removed,what if trump does things that you guys like hes been in office day is and everyones acting like the worlds ending
IAmA,not_removed,former acting attorney general sally yates dear sally question have you considered inviting donald to relate his worldview to you while drawing his attention to any paradoxes revealed that rationally shouldnt be there
IAmA,not_removed,yeah ops questions are framed so badly if it does happen im hoping people will ask neutral questions such as did you anticipate this outcome etc
IAmA,not_removed,waging a war
IAmA,not_removed,good call you are right
IAmA,not_removed,yeah never ask direct questions never act unexpected always stay square and never dare to try another approach this way to think made trump president in the first place
IAmA,not_removed,at this point its the question many people are thinking especially after the attorney general tried and failed to halt trump its a naturally loaded question but any president with this abuse of power this soon i think we need an answer to where is the presidents off switch for when we actually do need to answer that question
IAmA,not_removed,vote and tell your friends to vote
IAmA,not_removed,always have always will
IAmA,not_removed,honestly the mods should have deleted this thread based on the rules of the sub
IAmA,not_removed,you shouldnt need that edit
IAmA,not_removed,i still dont know
IAmA,not_removed,very sadly true for most people
IAmA,not_removed,nope neither do they know how employment works probably because they dont have jobs she told the doj not to follow a presidential order now theres a new ag its a really easy flowchart
IAmA,not_removed,because the attorney general is there to be the presidents expert on judicial matters she said she wasnt sure about the legality of it which is basically her job trump didnt like what she told him and fired her think about the precedent this now sets if you speak out against the president from a position within the white house youre gone within hours hes filling his cabinet with people who tell him what he wants to hear as opposed to what he needs to hear
IAmA,not_removed,obama had very strong reason to believe that there would be terrorists coming because of a potential attack bowling green plot i believe rather than they might do something so lets ban all countries without any evidence to suggest that
IAmA,not_removed,i care why do i have to like obama to hate trump cant both dissapoint me
IAmA,not_removed,well the answer is that it was wrong in both cases not that she should act illegally for trump too because she is alleged to have deemed it acceptable under obama as you seem to imply
IAmA,not_removed,what are you taking about the kentucky case there was never a stop in immigration from iraq just a slow down which was back up the next year less youre spewing more trumpfox related garbage then i cant help you there
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,the difference mostly lies in what obama issued executive orders for and what trump issued executive orders for if obama had proposed the muslim ban many would react the same way as many are now
IAmA,not_removed,this is a very reasonable question i hope it gets a reasonable answer too
IAmA,not_removed,factual yet downvoted cause liberalism and massive ctr funding probably
IAmA,not_removed,because the acting ag was a political hack that needed to go assistant ags have no problem with this order and her letter to the executive was less than professional
IAmA,not_removed,because that was a response to a specific threat the bowling green plot and not a political ploy because it was much narrower only currently processing refugees only one country and with a specific goal there were plenty of people protesting including many of the same veterans that are protesting now because translators that were sponsored by the military were caught up both times
IAmA,not_removed,boom exactly
IAmA,not_removed,ops post is disappointing simply from the loaded questions
IAmA,not_removed,the comments in here are amazing a hero you guys have low standards on heroics
IAmA,not_removed,for getting fired from a job she was going to be removed from anyway ok clock kid is a hero too i guess
IAmA,not_removed,how
IAmA,not_removed,you misspelled traitor
IAmA,not_removed,a attorney general is a cabinet position she was going to lose her job anyway qq she lost it a week sooner b what trump did was in no way shape or form unconstitutional obama literally did the exact same thing to iraq in the constitution doesnt have shit to do with foreigners attempting to gain entry to our country
IAmA,not_removed,funny she never did under obama but now she does she didnt even defend the constitution funny if it was about guns you guys would be whining to rid of them defending the constitution as you and obama saw fit
IAmA,not_removed,translation reeeeeeeeeeeeee
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,i agree she should contact them
IAmA,not_removed,is she negotiating with a foreign entity on behalf of the us government without authorization to do so is she actively attempting to foment insurrection or rebellion against the us government if not then its not treason its not really a matter of opinion
IAmA,not_removed,she is defending the constitution and upholding her sworn duty that is her job
IAmA,not_removed,years
IAmA,not_removed,fyi trump is elected already
IAmA,not_removed,because im sure an exattorney general wouldnt be able to find a good paying job 👍👍
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,most people support him right do you live in a parallel universe
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,are you really this fucking stupid
IAmA,not_removed,obama didnt have a iraq travel ban he paused processing of visas trump banned travel by people who have visas and green cards who have a legal right to be here people with green cards may have been here for decades went to the bahamas for the weekend and end up banned from returning to their homes families jobs businesses etc because the cheeto god is much more concerned with throwing red meat to his trailer park supporters than governing if you dont believe me look it up you are being lied to and you are lapping it up
IAmA,not_removed,you know i started to reply to this comment and then realized you wouldnt even listen and would probably lash out have a good day and educate yourself in the differences
IAmA,not_removed,that video cuts off too soon but i think the point the senator is trying to make is that its the supreme courts job to determine if something is unlawfulunconstitutional
IAmA,not_removed,she will go after an elected position
IAmA,not_removed,i agree i used to look forward coming to reddit during my work breaks but the politics on here have turned me away so many hypocrites sad
IAmA,not_removed,so sad
IAmA,not_removed,times like these i ask myself what a trump supporter would say i know if you dont like it get out
IAmA,not_removed,girlbye
IAmA,not_removed,dont like it get the fuck out
IAmA,not_removed,help money apparently
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think an attorney general or any attorney dislikes the publics attention when they have a cause to fight for also we are potential voterssupporters for whatever she wants to do in the future im sure she will be pressured to use her publicity to get into some kind of an office mayor governor senate congress ngoetc
IAmA,not_removed,noones surprised youre working in a farm
IAmA,not_removed,grow up dude
IAmA,not_removed,do you need some ice for that butthurt
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,she did her job she got fired for it
IAmA,not_removed,lawyers have an ethical responsibility like your president to uphold the law this was illegal she did her job your president didnt he is forcing a constitutional crisis in his first two weeks in office
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,your use of the word cucked shows me you probably hold views from the century antidemocratic shows me you dont understand what democracy is and for some reason think it means bending over to be fucked by the supreme leader after theyre elected your use of the word disgusting shows me you hold the views of a year old as you cant accept that other people hold different views your use of the word socialist shows you seem to think that a socialist is just someone you dont agree with spoiler alert thats not what a socialist is its fine to disagree with her but if youre going to insult her then at make it moderately relevant
IAmA,not_removed,whats wrong with socialism thanks to the limited amount we have in this country my family can eat and live in a house
IAmA,not_removed,lol triggered
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,add another cents to your account
IAmA,not_removed,what can we do to stop trump gg op
IAmA,not_removed,and the first one shes already answered also yes she certainly knew this was coming the minute she said i will not anyone who wasnt yet sure what the gag is they know now
IAmA,not_removed,sure theyre framed badly but considering sally yates actions the questions really arent too charged looking at op probably wants to know what she thinks we should to support her actions which is valid ama material
IAmA,not_removed,yeah agree entirely better questions would be around the nature of offices relations with the white house or the constitution vs government policy in general not pro or against either side
IAmA,not_removed,ah thanks for that i get so caught up that i forget minor details
IAmA,not_removed,this is not the area for debate this is for strict information regarding positions you want a political debate go anywhere but here in reddit its happening all over the place theres no shortage of it so dont act like there is
IAmA,not_removed,alternative implies there are multiple sets of correct factual occurrences there are not one woman did one thing to one administration and nothing was done in the dark
IAmA,not_removed,thats mere opinion the other side could easily say she her bias was impacting her judgement
IAmA,not_removed,lobbyists are crushingly effective organizing yourself and your friends family to vote would be hilariously ineffective even assuming they all actually vote for the same person
IAmA,not_removed,at this rate midterms is too long to wait and next presidential cycle most certainly is
IAmA,not_removed,did you see the infograph depicting education and political stance that should tell you something
IAmA,not_removed,not long i think not long at all before people go missing
IAmA,not_removed,opposition in a democracy the us is not a democracy she is not an elected official her job was to carry out the instructions from the head of the executive branch
IAmA,not_removed,its ok to break a rule like that in order to have this discussion at least in my opinion every discussion about trump or his latest actions as president will always end up being a shitshow but the us as a nation and reddit as a community we need to have these shitshows that way were at least talking about it
IAmA,not_removed,really really should not need that edit but all opinions and facts are slanderous lies now especially when telling people a simple truth like hey this ama frame is kind of biased
IAmA,not_removed,if it was his pick that went against his executive orders thatd be pretty big but we are dealing with a remnant from obama i stand behind ops point that shes gone within a week this couldve been a completley politcal move especially considering he appointed another remnant from obama that will actually defend the ban
IAmA,not_removed,it is not her job to question the legality of it that is the supreme courts job she is part of the cabinet even the supreme court agrees that trump has the right to do this she is completely in the wrong for believing it is down to her to stop this
IAmA,not_removed,im just surprised that nobody expected this our acting president has never been told no a single time in his life as a business leader it may have been smart to surround yourself with a makeshift ego echochamber but its honestly just foreboding as president
IAmA,not_removed,office of legal counsel is there to be the presidents experts on law they said the order was fine they are authoritative
IAmA,not_removed,wasnt ctr part of the clinton campaign the one that ended back in november
IAmA,not_removed,trashtalking liberalism like a true fascist
IAmA,not_removed,lol dude youre a freak come back to the real world
IAmA,not_removed,there was never actually a ban the admissions process slowed down while previously admitted refugees were revetted but it never actually stopped
IAmA,not_removed,was that threat publicized before the visa order was given i dont believe it was it affected people which is more than the current order will likely affect and because of the timing during active iraqi action it affected far more iraqis who assisted us in the war please provide proof of significant protests ive searched quite a bit and havent found a single news story indicating anything but a few meek objections nothing like a real live protest
IAmA,not_removed,you realise however that the countries with an immigration ban all except syria were highlighted by the obama regime as countries at risk for dangerous immigrants trump didnt select the countries trump has equal justification we need to make sure that there is sufficient control over who gets into the country from dangerous failed states and once the vetting process is established then we can take in immigrants in the exact same numbers as proposed during the first years of the obama administration and bushs
IAmA,not_removed,these are bad responses
IAmA,not_removed,all of it is fucking retarded its baiting idiots from both sides to throw their own filth at each other and its disgraceful to see americans like this
IAmA,not_removed,sacrificing your job to stand up for what you believe in is pretty heroic imo
IAmA,not_removed,sally is the hero reddit needs anything that moves to make trump look bad or undermine him
IAmA,not_removed,lol it truly is amazing its funny watching both sides point fingers at each other from the outside they dont realize they might as well point their fingers at a mirror
IAmA,not_removed,i appreciate her standing up and not carrying out an order she believed to be unconstitutional in her case given how limited her time remaining in the job was saying no and getting fired was probably the best course of action im a bit concerned that everyone seems to be too quick to praise those who have or may in the future resign in protest though i believe this is what trumpbannon want they want to purge the government of anyone who will stand up to them and replace them with lackeys if people resign of their own volition thats all the better for them they can claim their hands were clean i believe we need good people in government who oppose trumps idiocy to stay we need them to stay and fight him grind his overreaches to a halt with any bureaucratic hurdle they can subvert him from the inside this will obviously be very difficult and require walking a fine line but we need a fabian strategy at the moment
IAmA,not_removed,shes a traitor because she stood up for the first amendment why do trump supporters only support the constitution when its convenient to them
IAmA,not_removed,america only exists because of traitors
IAmA,not_removed,she is a traitor to the forcible suppression of opposition aka fascism she is hero for standing up for what she believed to be unjust unamerican aka freedom
IAmA,not_removed,did you see the infographic on education and political stance that should tell you something what trump did was illegal she told him so he cant just do whatever he wants he has to follow the law
IAmA,not_removed,i dont think you understand that term this ban will be used against us in the form of extremist propaganda some of us would rather see an end to the fear mongering and a return to actual american values not the made up bullshit the far right chooses to promote
IAmA,not_removed,she swore an oath to the constitution and american people not an orange child dicktator
IAmA,not_removed,i remember when conservatives respected the constitution
IAmA,not_removed,thanks america
IAmA,not_removed,to adress part b of this comment whether or not what trump did is unconstitutional is still up in the air i dont think it is but im not a lawer but it is not at all literally the exact same thing is a pretty good summary on why basically obamas order restricted only refugees without visas even then the order still let some in
IAmA,not_removed,obama did not do the same thing try fucking reading something other than breitbart fox and oann you fucking dolt
IAmA,not_removed,you need to stop reading fake news what you are saying is not true
IAmA,not_removed,stop spreading false info
IAmA,not_removed,dude all of reddit is taken over by ctr or whatever name they go by now fake accounts spreading hate against trump and worse trump supporters normalizing attacks on trump supporters etc reddit is chasing half of its reader base away because liberals think theyve a monopoly on truth you can see here that redditors act like she was defending the constitution which does not extend to non citizens meanwhile they spend most their time whining about guns the second amendment most in here dont know politics outside what they read from the politics section which is nothing but an anti right wing hate hub none in here know economics they only know how to cite talking points like fake news or sourcing brietbart because they heard a leftie once say it used to just be fox news but they are including more right wing media while ignoring how shitty and bias the rest is theyve no self awareness
IAmA,not_removed,dont worry some people understand this most of these down votes are out of false information and their feelings good post
IAmA,not_removed,im sorry but this is hipocrisy despite the fact that some people turned blind eyes to some of obamas actions not every democrat has done so it doesnt make it less wrong when trump does it justifying acting against the constitution because the other guy did it too only makes the constitution less powerfull it doesnt help absolutely anyone
IAmA,not_removed,obama didnt do anything unconstitutional so theres that
IAmA,not_removed,youre stupid stop talking
IAmA,not_removed,
IAmA,not_removed,no way
IAmA,not_removed,really showing your intelligence arent you
IAmA,not_removed,i wouldnt hire someone who put feelings ahead of security poor guy walks up to armored truck in poor heres a sob story okay heres a bunch of money
IAmA,not_removed,only with scum good riddance
IAmA,not_removed,youre welcome
IAmA,not_removed,yes he apparently is
IAmA,not_removed,i think you should be the one to look it up for one travel to the us from the bahamas is not banned so thats a pretty bad example also while it was poorly implemented right at the very start people with green cards visas and dualcitizenship are still allowed to come back to the us even from banned countries yes they may go through extra questioning and screening but they are not banned completely it literally took me less than minutes to look that up
IAmA,not_removed,you clever bastard i actually took it literally for a second there
IAmA,not_removed,oh ill happily be magaing for the next years id suggest everyone pacing your crying as dehydration is a real threat what happened to all those promises of celebrities leaving the country if trump was elected anyways
IAmA,not_removed,dont like muslims in our country get the fuck out
IAmA,not_removed,i dont get why this got downvoted i totally agree
IAmA,not_removed,what does that even mean does producing milk and livestock somehow equate to a lesser stance in life that i am less a man than a doctor lawyer or whatever career you find respectable what obvious stereotype are you trying to push on me here are you insinuating you have to be ignorant to work on a farm do you imbeciles even know the amount of structure it takes to run such institutions how much moneybit takes how much trust in your fellow humans it takes of course you dont go ahead and hivemind downvote me you bunch of pathetic chumps
IAmA,not_removed,your president are you speaking from the outside in shut the fuck up if so if you are pulling the notmypresident bullshit then shut the fuck up this is not a land of immigrants this is a land for americans and everyone under that banner that provides for the betterment of society i owe nothing no healthcare university or jobs to refugees stop being retarded or shilling
IAmA,not_removed,this is someone from rthedonald dont bother s
IAmA,not_removed,most cringe comment so far century what about the or or or how about century isreal or japan i think you have little understanding about what you say and you live under the assumption that the worst thing you can do is be racist and the best thing you can do is be progressive
IAmA,not_removed,nothings wrong with true socialism but modern socialism is mainly marxist socialism redistribution of wealth etc national socialism is what youre looking for and is a very rational and working alternative approach go government
IAmA,not_removed,fbi opens a file on every username in here
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i was thinking that pretty sure the answer is something along the lines of throw the country into civil war
IAmA,not_removed,yeah i didnt think they were too bad either it would be one thing if op was like how do we get trump impeached but its just general questions that go along with the circumstances at hand as long as the extremes is stay away or get deleted it should be fine unfortunately extremists on both sides ruin it for everyone i want to know did trump say youre fired or was it done more professionally
IAmA,not_removed,would also be a different ama the op is clearly interested in a specific action by the ag not about the position in general you may disagree with the motivation but remaking it into an interactive civics lesson isnt going to satisfy the ops curiosity
IAmA,not_removed,she did a good job she told the new boss to get stuffed when she knew she was out the door in a week
IAmA,not_removed,she is most certainly not a rogue attorney she did her job and refused to uphold an illegal and unconstitutional order issued by the president of the united states comrade trump there is supposed to be a system of checks and balances on power so that we remain america and not a dictatorship the last time a president fired the attorney general for doing their job was when nixon fired his for refusing to cover up watergate the president is not above the law and refusing to do illegal things is not going rogue
IAmA,not_removed,no prob sorry for being pedantic
IAmA,not_removed,no political debate on reddit the big forum about life on the internet lul ok
IAmA,not_removed,well hes president now so yes midterms are the nearest opportunity to actually threaten trump with any consequences for any of his actions i dont think he plans on winning reelection though to be honest however we were shocked the first time he won so its not impossible
IAmA,not_removed,i missed it but i have a feeling i know exactly what to expect got a link
IAmA,not_removed,it does make it very easy to be vindicated from one side of the fence though
IAmA,not_removed,unfortunately probably more power abuse in one month than americans have known in quite some time i dont think thats an opinion either his presidency is already hallmarked by the abuse of the executive order it hasnt even been four weeks
IAmA,not_removed,the oath of the ag is to the constitution only not to the president if you think being unelected means not having to worry about constitutionality just wait till trump gives mattis an illegal order
IAmA,not_removed,and the role of the german soldier was to carry out orders and exterminate the vermin jews s that is not true the role of ag is to prosecute and conduct all suits in the supreme court in which the united states shall be concerned and to give his or her advice and opinion upon questions of law when required by the president of the united states or when requested by the heads of any of the departments to which her advice was this order is unlawful i can not and will not defend it the ag is just as every american citizen legally and ethically bound to the constitution edit it is my professional opinion that it is very likely to be unconstitutional i cannot defend it without a proper review
IAmA,not_removed,the judicial branch doesnt just do exactly what the president says theyre a separate branch for a reason its a system of checks and balances and the acting ag believed that what was asked was unlawful
IAmA,not_removed,the us is a republic or representative democracy this means that we are not in the business of directly deciding issues and leaders but instead we elect officials who operate an increasingly entrenched government this is very simple shit this is what high school students learn please read up first and comment second next time
IAmA,not_removed,i used to agree sadly i see less discussion and more screeching hysteria from both sides these days one side certainly more than the other
IAmA,not_removed,yeah this was basically the reason for the last second edit i feel now more than ever the us vs them mentality is running rampant and people are looking for more and more ways to label someone friend or foe at a glance
IAmA,not_removed,if it is political its pretty smart honestly she wedged herself into importance by doing this instead of just waiting to be removed from office anyway
IAmA,not_removed,it is her job the oath that every lawyer takes includes this language i will not counsel or maintain any suit or proceeding which shall appear to me to be unjust nor any defense except such as i believe to be honestly debatable under the law of the land consider this hypothetical if some future president were to order the us marshals service to summarily execute all the left handed people in the us would you want all the employees of the justice department to say well im just really here to unthinkingly rubberstamp everything that hits my desk or would you want them to exercise a smidgen of independent thought and perhaps to possess a spine
IAmA,not_removed,one google would answer your question but yes same thing but now it has funding it was mill now its like mill
IAmA,not_removed,trashtalking liberalism like a true fascist meanwhile denying a direct order from the president of the united states like a true patriot
IAmA,not_removed,er do you have any idea how many syrian refugees there are hint its more than
IAmA,not_removed,obama placed those terms for those countries as a way for the congress to enact legislation they see fit if they want to limit travel no one thought the president would issue an eo that was incomplete and overall disorganized and you can see this from the fact that the congress didnt know and that the secretary of hs wasnt brief until after the eo was passed trump detained us citizens and now both hs and the trump admin the congress and national security officials are all confused and have differing opinions on how to deal with visa residents trump fucked up by issuing this with no communication why do you think airport officials denied habeas corpus to our own citizens for having dual citizenship cause the eo was not well thought out you can play the obama part all you want and the rights has been trying to justify this but the fact remains that what obama did and what trump did are completely different thats like saying maybe we should think about how we feel about pistachios and then trump going burn every pistachio farm in the world
IAmA,not_removed,americas vetting process is one of the most extreme in the world please do research on the topic before you discuss it
IAmA,not_removed,except all the countries that have actually sent terrorists to the us and europe arent on the list was saudi arabians and egyptians paris nice berlin maghrebs from north africa its a cheap political ploy that doesnt even address the problems it claims to be attacking
IAmA,not_removed,she was going to be replaced within the week as is always the case with a new president and cabinet members didnt really sacrifice much
IAmA,not_removed,she was an acting ag who was going to be replaced its not like shes living paycheck to paycheck and just sacrificed a minimum wage job
IAmA,not_removed,that would include trump himself
IAmA,not_removed,idk why youre getting downvotes i wonder if they are from both sides of us political beliefs or just misunderstanding you
IAmA,not_removed,syrian refugees do not have constitutional protection jackass thats limited to citizens
IAmA,not_removed,how is she standing up for the first amendment the refugee ban has nothing to do with the first amendment lmao
IAmA,not_removed,why do liberals forget about the second amendment when posturing about how amazing they are with everything all these amazing constitutionalists that choose when to defend it seems they didnt care or anyone else when obama pissed on it for years typical liberal fashion a conservative does it its bad otherwise a liberal does it its good and noble trumps protecting the second amendment obama kept trying to get people to hate guns who is defending what pick and choose your liberal logic
IAmA,not_removed,sorry but thats not even remotely what fascism is fascism is an economic policy thats very similar to capitalism stop associating economics with dictatorships
IAmA,not_removed,where was she when obama banned iraqis in
IAmA,not_removed,you mentioned this infographic a couple times what is it
IAmA,not_removed,ya wow go read the politics section because if you believe your side is above fear campaign s youve been sleeping since jan holy shit what a joke liberals not into fear campaigns when theyve literally spent trumps entire time in office protesting commenting etc over fears of what he will do all fear mongering and fantasy wow down vote away the politics section is fucking visual proof of that statement being utter shit literally actual proof but proof doesnt go far to a liberal actual visual proof of fear mongering all trump supporters are nazis to the left wing simple fear mongering and its resulting in right wingers being attacked on the street thats the best part is the left protesters are committing acts in the streets right now brilliant
IAmA,not_removed,everything is used against us in the form of extremist propaganda these riots and protests by the left are being used against as extremist propaganda already the fact that our women can go outside without a male escort and a trash bag on their head is being used against us by islamist extremists so you really think muslims are so weak that they can be driven to murder people this easily if so then perhaps the restrictions arent all that bad are they
IAmA,not_removed,i dont it makes me sad that conservative has become synonymous with all of the backward thinking that needs to go where is eisenhower or teddy roosevelt
IAmA,not_removed,youre so full of it syrian refugees do not have constitutional rights only us citizens do
IAmA,not_removed,its not up in the air at all the constitution has absofuckinglutely nothing to do with refugees from the middle east it is entirely about rights of citizens of the us and what laws the government can or cannot create
IAmA,not_removed,now discuss cnn guardian msnbc etc all the truth outlets right is hillary gonna win chance oh my i bet brexit is going to happen what other things do your sources come up with were they right all year or super wrong all year with a sprinkling of you ignoring all that come up with something new other than fox is bias cant even come up with an original comment that hasnt been jerked to death
IAmA,not_removed,i am not a fake account i do not hate the right i do fear what is becoming of our country under trumps leadership we are and have always been a country of immigrants and i feel that this ban is unconstitutional he prioritized the refugees who are christian against those who are of the muslim faith that goes against our constitution the first amendment states congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances trump is trying to restrict a certain religion he told the univision reporter to get of his press confrence which conflicts with freedom of press part to top it off there are millions who now excersise the right to assemble in protest i just ask that you do not dismiss our very real concerns and we will not dismiss yours we work better together and not divided
IAmA,not_removed,then leave bye
IAmA,not_removed,ive got over comment karma i couldnt care less about year olds who get all their info from reddit and think the us constitution applies to foreigners downvoting lol
IAmA,not_removed,sure it does you guys never once spoke out against obama but do now because its trump stop pretending that doesnt happen protests literally started the day trump got into power they ended the day obama got into power and were missing the entire years he was in office still committing acts of war spying yet no protests this is because a liberal does it its ok otherwise its wrong same shit in canada liberal does it its good otherwise its bad of course it matters its called consistency and accepting truth otherwise youre just supporting your fave team and pretending its for noble reasons
IAmA,not_removed,you mean besides the dozen or so court cases his administration lost when challenged in the supreme court
IAmA,not_removed,good comment this is the type of discussion i expect from the left
IAmA,not_removed,come up with some new catchphrases trump humper
IAmA,not_removed,nope im a lawyer and ive read both orders myself but nice try i guess
IAmA,not_removed,no the ban is based on where you are from not where you are travelling from bahamians are not banned a syrian green card holder who has lived here for forty years and takes an untimely vacation is
IAmA,not_removed,also the order by its terms does ban them completely some have been released because courts ordered them released others have not been released yet despite there being no evidence to support detaining them customs officials seem to be choosing ad hoc whether to follow the rule of law or follow their boss
IAmA,not_removed,okay then you cant compare the two bans at all one was an executive order not looked by homeland security and the other one was voted on obamas ban didnt effect green card holders at all and of course targeted one nation in response to a specific event its actually surprising that you really think she would go to lobbying when she could make plenty of money being on literally any other position related to her previous position not a long way of saying im wrong just annoyed that youre uneducated im a free market libertarian and im against it as are of my conservative friends so please inform me if you see any holes in my points i will be glad to defend them
IAmA,not_removed,dude thats my point fuck that guy bitching about someone defending the constitution
IAmA,not_removed,is all you do talk shit holy fuck im not a trump supporter but i seen you several times just patronizing people
IAmA,not_removed,triggered
IAmA,not_removed,this is not a land of immigrants lol
IAmA,not_removed,that was a really concise run through of how to be a colossally shitty and immoral human being checklist bravo as for your president i mean the president you support i recognize that trump is legally president i do not support him if he tried to do something positive for the country yet to see any sign of that i would support him in that endeavor again unlikely to happen but i will never support him you can tell me to shut the fuck up all you want but its only because you have no ability to counter anything i am saying you are an ignorant degenerate and most of all you are scared scared because you know that you are inferior to most of the world that you cant compete that the only value you have is value your government artificially gives to you you know that most immigrants are actually stronger morally superior better than you in every way and so you fight against them sorry special snowflake but in the long run you are going to lose
IAmA,not_removed,your first lady is an immigrant trumps family immigrated here only about of this country didnt immigrate here
IAmA,not_removed,oh i assumed so but leaving them in an echo chamber just makes them believe the legitimacy of their insults
IAmA,not_removed,i chose the century because your use of the word cucked reminded me of othello i didnt go into any detail about my views so i think youre jumping to conclusions if anything i helped you with your insults as now you know that the best insults are grounded in reality not plucked out of the air
IAmA,not_removed,fbi agent hmm lets look into this pmmeurfarts fellow
IAmA,not_removed,this lady should be arrested for failing to do her job for the american people put her in the cell next to obama and the clintons
IAmA,not_removed,i want to know did trump say youre fired or was it done more professionally this is top of the list for me
IAmA,not_removed,its the climate we live in now criticism and plain fact are slander now
IAmA,not_removed,oh i dont know ask the right open question about the constitution and i think youd find out what she thought
IAmA,not_removed,would you not basically ask trump to fire you if you were about to be forced to be in sally yates shoes
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt say that youre were never considered the smart person of a class were you
IAmA,not_removed,no sorry hopefully another redditor will supply the link i suck at searching
IAmA,not_removed,to which her advice was this order is unlawful i can not and will not defend it that is not what happened at all rather than make that statement to the president she worked for she instructed the justice department to ignore a perfectly legal executive order to make a political point
IAmA,not_removed,the judicial branch is the court system the ag and the department of justice is actually a part of the executive branch
IAmA,not_removed,the ag is part of the executive branch not the judicial branch you just failed grade civics
IAmA,not_removed,as i have already explained no it is not her job to question the legality the legality was shown to be there by the supreme court its her job to do the orders of the president in the case of your example if the supreme court ruled that it is legal to do so then yes however the supreme court would never allow this and your example falls short because of that
IAmA,not_removed,its unconstitutional to execute that many people for no reason it would only be constitutional if approved by a higher court and eventually upheld by the supreme court so no the doj does not have to sit under the presidents thumb theyre loyal to the constitution only
IAmA,not_removed,a direct order that violated the law she was right to refuse trumps order she was wrong to accept obamas
IAmA,not_removed,wanna have a talk about nixon
IAmA,not_removed,would you drink a gallon of horse urine if the president ordered you to the president is a public servant as much as he or she is a leader
IAmA,not_removed,hint we admitted syrian refugees for the entirety of a day stay will not affect anywhere near perhaps the number of refugees is so high because obama dropped bombs on syria in look at that obamas about with it comes to blowing up sections of their county and accepting people interesting
IAmA,not_removed,i like the points in your first paragraph but then you tried to lump the guy your responding to into a blurry group lets keep the informed responses coming please
IAmA,not_removed,im not sure if you realise but under section of what was issued it clearly stipulates that those coming to the country would be viewed case by case on whether they could come into the country citizens with dual citizenship clearly fall into this and will be allowed into the country trump wasnt even the first to do this reagan did it without protest in obama did the same exact thing for entire months double what is currently happening also the problem with what you said at the end is that its an analogy fallacy it isnt relevant as a comparison as the two things arent the same hence why its a fallacy im also not sure if you realise this but most of these states prohibit and ban immigration to israeli jews and chrostians and many other minorities im guessing that it doesnt matter how those minorities are treated by the countries in question
IAmA,not_removed,so when people from other countries bypass the vetting process they become illegal is what i can extrapolate from your statement
IAmA,not_removed,is that why in alone more than cases of people entered into the country to resort to terrorism do you believe it is acceptable to remain at the same vetting process when of syrians are isis supporters its not drastic at all to improve the vetting process coming to the country as an immigrant is a privilege not a right also maybe do your own research before telling others they dont know what theyre talking about
IAmA,not_removed,fbi says the process doesnt work dhs testified the same
IAmA,not_removed,its proactive not reactive those are failed states mostly
IAmA,not_removed,trump himself has said that in future more countries could be added to the list the countries who are currently suffering from the immigration ban are countries selected by obama as dangerous meaning they are most likely to have immigrants that are not acceptable to have in america anecdotal evidence of where specific regions terrorists have come from is insufficient compared to the proper statistics of many other criteria
IAmA,not_removed,yeah but that makes it even more impressive she very easily couldve kept her head down do nothing and serve out her term instead she risked her career and future employment opportunities to stand up for what she believed in you can always get another minimum wage job but at her level a black mark like that could be a career ender
IAmA,not_removed,dont confuse them with facts they are very delusional they still think we are banning muslims
IAmA,not_removed,you said liberal or derivative of it in every paragraph well done
IAmA,not_removed,relevant clip on obama and gun control i did not agree with a lot of things obama did either fwiw calling her a traitor for saying this is illegal sets a terrible and dangerous precident
IAmA,not_removed,it violates international law she told him so
IAmA,not_removed,he was trying to attack the loopholes like the gun show one that made it extremely easy for most anyone to get one without a waiting period he just didnt want the process of becoming a gun owner so pathetic and easy would you hand car keys to a year old with no prior training and tell him to go have fun plus his decisions were coming off the heels of major mass shootingsbut no youre right he wasnt aiming to correct a broken system with loopholes he was just pissing on the constitution
IAmA,not_removed,fascism is not an economic policy any more than communism is even the most rudimentary reading on the subject will make it clear to you that you are wrong educate yourself the key defining element of fascism is suppression of opposition
IAmA,not_removed,did you even look it up your ignorance is off the charts
IAmA,not_removed,that never happened after two people with approved visas were identified as threats but no criminal action in the us all iraqi refugees were subject to additional screening the number of people who came in under that program were much lower than and due to the increased processing time but six thousand were still approved see more info here
IAmA,not_removed,the obama administrations actions were limited to one country and in response to a specific threat there are more differences but im not sure your willing to reason on this edit forgot to say i have no idea where she was
IAmA,not_removed,when a troll is too obvious smh
IAmA,not_removed,actually only once damn i am better at searching than i thought
IAmA,not_removed,the left protesters are committing acts in the streets right now holy fucking shit dude your ideas are as clear as your grammar once this shit burns down and the adults start rebuilding civilization we should implement a literacy test for voting
IAmA,not_removed,we arent protesting over fear of what he will do were protesting over things he promised to do were protesting on the things he campaigned on one example donald has said he wants to bring back torture well the senate select committee on intelligence released their research on enhanced interrogation techniques aka torture in it they show that yes torture yields evidence but it doesnt yield real evidence apparently when people think theyre dying theyll say anything you want to hear that is horrifying also a few dumb protesters doesnt make the whole movement completely irrelevant it means that and i know this is hard to grasp some people are shitbags regardless of where they are youre an excellent example of this
IAmA,not_removed,were not dealing with someone named timmy from the walking down the street whistling and waving at their neighbors its not like timmy hears someone talk shit about muslims and immediately turns into an extremist were talking about people who have been through wars civil and otherwise for years people who have been swept up with little cause dragged to a cia black site and tortured without so much as a trial people who have never been involved in extremist activities yet they see their family killed in a drone strike its not just one tiny thing its the overwhelming amount of shit that happened their lives some of these are people who endangered themselves and their families as interpreters and were promised asylum only to go through a two year vetting process during which who knows what could happen then they find out after all that personal suffering that bobby mcfuckface hates him and his president just made it impossible to gain access to the us
IAmA,not_removed,tr was a republican progressive not a conservative
IAmA,not_removed,hey your right man everyone is at some point the reason trumps new ban is seen as unconstitutional has more to do with the due process part of the constitution than discrimination at least thats how i took it there are laws against religious discrimination of potential immigrants however your right its not in the constitution but theres definitely gonna be some form of legal battle there just republicans vs democrats nothing new not the end of the world the point i was trying to make and probably could have made without sounding like a partisan idiot is that the conservatives freaked the fuck out about due process with some of obamas executive orders but now that its the red teams turn in office they dont seem to give a fuck anymore im not saying anything new just pointing out the general hypocrisy of political parties and politicians in washington
IAmA,not_removed,there is a very big difference between reporting analyst opinions based on polls and reporting the news predictions about the election were analysis pieces pointing to how cnn got that wrong and trying to make a leap from there to cnn is fake news is just plain idiotic
IAmA,not_removed,to be fair more than half the country thought trump was never going to win he was a joke and it came as a shock to alot of people he actually won
IAmA,not_removed,i dont read any of that shit kthxbye
IAmA,not_removed,you can go fuck yourself
IAmA,not_removed,we have been a nation of controlled immigration and historically at much lower numbers than now weve never been about allowing anyone to walk in and we shouldnt be now this current trend was started in the mid and was supposed to be temporary this history where we welcomed anyone and everyone with open arms is a fallacy
IAmA,not_removed,the constitution applies to us citizens not refugees from terrorist friendly countries
IAmA,not_removed,you guys im brazilian what the hell do you mean there were no protests wasnt occupy during his presidency since when is it wrong to protest isnt that one of the pros of being in a democracy to have the right to free speech and being able to bring up wrongdoing of the governement you are doing precisely that or are you in some way trying to imply no republican ever spoke out against obama during his presidency are you fucking kidding me in what reality do you live dude and dude just google democrats criticize obama and youll realize you are being completely unfair and maybe youll even realize that it is not only liberals that lack consistency if you truly wish to make your country great start by understanding you own fault and hipocrisy have a nice life edit typo
IAmA,not_removed,didnt take me minutes to find protests against obamas drone policy httppeaceandjusticeorguknewsletterbuildingdemocracydronesweekprotestsacrosstheukus check the dates of the news and maybe look for more your ignorance of the events does not mean they didnt happen
IAmA,not_removed,and lies about politics are exactly what i expected from the fascist
IAmA,not_removed,httpwwwsnopescommexicoguatemalaborder
IAmA,not_removed,dont like it get the fuck out of my country
IAmA,not_removed,it is by demographic a land for whites since immigration act of however the white population has been dwindling rapidly from of the total population to now a meager japan provides for the japanese china provides for the chinese nigeria provides for nigerians etc we are not a land of immigrants and your laughter is exactly why public school is a piece of shit a nation is no nation without a common people its in the very latin roots of the word nation i lol at you not the other way around shitlib fucking ctr
IAmA,not_removed,dog im not the guy you originally responded to
IAmA,not_removed,to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american public ― theodore roosevelt
IAmA,not_removed,that lady was doing her job her job is to look at th legal implications both local and international not do whatever her bosses tell her to
IAmA,not_removed,dear fucking god here we go you are a raging lunatic like obama and the clintons belong in a cell anymore than any of the other million career politicians out there 🙄
IAmA,not_removed,you should sign up to be donalds personal butt boy i am confident you would do a great job licking his ass clean
IAmA,not_removed,by american did you mean wasps
IAmA,not_removed,insulting now we certainly know whos the idiot d
IAmA,not_removed,the president she worked for although she reports to potus its more accurate that she works for the constitution and the american people from within white house she instructed the justice department to ignore on the basis that she beleived it to be unconstitutional a perfectly legal executive order that is simply an incorrect statement as no court has ruled it as such you misconstrue me as saying it is definitely illegal at the very best it can be said to be a hotly contested topic with no clear answer and desperate need of a supreme court hearing it is the professional opinion of yates that it is not legal that interpretation is not without basis or broader support in the legal community
IAmA,not_removed,hmm i was unaware of this in my defence im from australia
IAmA,not_removed,people are going to downvote you but you are absolutely correct this ignorance is what happens when schools no longer teach civics
IAmA,not_removed,my bad in my defence im from australia
IAmA,not_removed,why exactly are people down voting you this is factually true this is verifiable with a google search fucking read
IAmA,not_removed,i dont understand your comment the legality was shown to be there by the supreme court what do you mean the ink on trumps executive order is barely dry it is likely to be several years before this makes its way through the appeals courts and is heard by the supreme court it has however been in front of at least district court judges all of whom found problems with it to get back to my hypothetical would you have the marshals service shoot as many left handed folks as they could find for a few years while they were waiting for a supreme court opinion
IAmA,not_removed,what war she denied trumps immigration order now shes out simple as that
IAmA,not_removed,and once were done talking about them then we can talk about the time jimmy carter deported muslims and denied immigration during the iran hostage crisis then we can talk about the time obama halted immigration from iraq for six months
IAmA,not_removed,sure but why not talk about someone more recent like bill and hillary clinton
IAmA,not_removed,the president is a public servant youre damn right he is latest rasmussen shows support for extreme vetting i would suggest you get used to this kind of stuff happening years is a long time to be on suicide watch
IAmA,not_removed,there is no day stay syrians have been banned indefinitely is the press in the us not reporting this or are people just not reading things properly presidents have been bombing for decades and people have been protesting it for decades whats so special about obama
IAmA,not_removed,the last paragraph being absurd was kinda intentional in the same way the ban was disorganized and hard to implement
IAmA,not_removed,so because they do it the us should do it too should we also enact sharia law because they already do it and apparently to you we have the same constitution as them saudi arabia commits war crimes daily and we still ally with them and yet when it comes to partisanship all of a sudden people want to get picky on which countries to antagonize saudi arabia should be on that list then since they have massive religious discrimination too the way we deal with diplomacy is not how we deal with regular humans we deal with business not ethics also in theory the eo might have been plausible but in practice it was horrible airport officials detained both us citizens and permanent residents when they landed in the us because they didnt know what casebycase basis to follow thats why the confusion happened hs tried to find out what the requirements for casebycase was and priebus gave them one answer and trump gave them another secretary kelly even went out and tried to clear the confusion and in turn got little to no response kelly had to go out and say that permanent residents are of national interest no shit and that they will still use casebycase well then has the trump administration found the regulations for casebycase cause it seems that theyre using the same vetting as fbi and state dept which the people should already have gone through
IAmA,not_removed,the only thing i can extrapolate from your statement is youre a moron
IAmA,not_removed,source on please
IAmA,not_removed,youre not banning shit trump doesnt need you tools anymore he has his presidency
IAmA,not_removed,shes lying it isnt illegal
IAmA,not_removed,rudimentary reading i studied world war for years in history and i did economics for years your rudimentary bullshit is obviously simplifying very broad topics
IAmA,not_removed,look what up fascism i studied history for years i know the difference
IAmA,not_removed,isis is a specific threat terrorism is a specific threat heres the deal you dont like it because trump did it stop play fuck fuck games
IAmA,not_removed,thanks and you mentioned it twice in this thread
IAmA,not_removed,they never had the right to gain access to the us immigration is a privilege my dear sir the notion that they are somehow more upset that they are temporarily blocked from immigrating seems outright pedantic compared to obama and bush and their actions if some random muslim is going to snap over this eo they were just looking for a reason i agree it is a huge list of things but that still doesnt excuse the behavior and if anything only reinforces the notion that we shouldnt allow every tom dick and harry into the country what obama and bush did or really didnt do to the interpreters was nothing less than cowardly i did my time in iraq and afghanistan im well aware of the dangers these fine people faced to help us im also well aware at the massive number of times we were screwed over and walked into danger on purpose by our interpreter my time also taught me that there are extreme cultural differences that dont vanish just because they gain access to this nation when it is considered acceptable universally so in some muslim nations to mutilate the genitalia of women and kill gay people thats not a society that is going to easily adapt in large numbers all of the quality interpreters are dead or already here a little late to start caring now by the way
IAmA,not_removed,meh you and your logic
IAmA,not_removed,shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion nor prohibit the free exercise of that has nothing to do with their citizenship it has to do with what he is actually able to do we need to stand up to a goverment who openly break the constitution if we let them bend the rules that govern our country when will they stop edit words
IAmA,not_removed,occupy wasnt against obama it was against republicans and wall street the comment is correct these types of protests did not exist when obama unilaterally attempted to drastically alter immigration policy and was actually ruled unconstitutional these protests and riots did not happen when obama dropped literal millions of bombs on middle eastern nations they also didnt happen when entire families were killed in drone strikes
IAmA,not_removed,you guys im brazilian what the hell do you mean there were no protests wasnt occupy during his presidency no and he got elected because of that and didnt do anything specific to wall street since when is it wrong to protest isnt that one of the pros of being in a democracy to have the right to free speech and being able to bring up wrongdoing of the governement its not and i never said it was you are doing precisely that or are you in some way trying to imply no republican ever spoke out against obama during his presidency im doing nothing outside what you falsely accuse me of and yes if people dont speak out against whoever is in power then its clear they support a team and not freedom or reality it doesnt matter their political side thats the point are you fucking kidding me in what reality do you live dude earth and dude just google democrats criticize obama and youll realize you are being completely unfair and maybe youll even realize that it is not only liberals that lack consistency obviously not everyone is like that sport calm down go read the politics section and tell me that subreddit is down the middle and scrutinizing both left and right then ask who makes up the majority of readers its liberals its a generalization but one reddit demonstrates especially just in this very discussion if you truly wish to make your country great start by understanding you own fault and hipocrisy have a nice life arrogant attitude accusations youre a perfect example of what i am talking about on the liberal side
IAmA,not_removed,i find it quite odd id be called a fascists considering my views are that of freedom and not forcing people to do anything not even force people to help others im not sure how that is fascists but its clear from the liberal propaganda machine thats taken over reddit the last few days everyones either a nazi or a fascists or whatever else during the election it was racists sexist homophobe etc but now its elevated to this if its ok to punch a nazi is it ok to punch a communists socialist thats the big question those being accused of being nazis are wondering in regards to those accusing them the true fascists people like myself arent setting america on fire and running fear campaigns people like myself arent running from confrontation or writing people off with labels because theyve nothing intelligent to say outside nazi its boring antiintelligent and totally fits the left wing narrative that is going on shouldnt you be out protesting with other feminists about a pay gap that doesnt exist or offensive halloween costumes
IAmA,not_removed,youre pathetic
IAmA,not_removed,please give me your legal argument i enjoy a good discussion and i would be interested to hear your textual interpretation
IAmA,not_removed,well done just what i would expect of an ignorant person
IAmA,not_removed,are you native american if not where did your family immigrate from
IAmA,not_removed,yeah this is a quote specifically talking about citizens and the press having the right to criticise the president as protected under the constitution it isnt about people who are sworn to uphold the law and exist within a very clear hierarchy unfortunately for yates her refusal to follow an executive order is a dismissable offence in short this quote is a fine one but isnt appropriate in this context
IAmA,not_removed,and it is sad that she got fired for doing exactly her job shows what too much power does to you
IAmA,not_removed,exactly none are better than the rest politics is run by money hungry power heads what do you expect at this point
IAmA,not_removed,are you acknowledging that they belong in a cell
IAmA,not_removed,k
IAmA,not_removed,she works for the american people from within white house your sophistry and mental contortions do not change the fact that she serves at the pleasure of the president
IAmA,not_removed,an educated populace is the political classes greatest fear
IAmA,not_removed,or when people would rather bitch and moan about alt this and alt that rather than actually understanding politics and government yes though its certainly a dark day for the us when the working class nightmare reaches the presidency and nobody is educated on what the government can and cannot legally do not trying to demonize trump either just stating that our current state is woefully inadequate very few americans understand america and that is very important knowledge to have right now
IAmA,not_removed,no worries mate
IAmA,not_removed,this type of order by a president has happened several times before twice in the case of a president refusing migration to aliens the court has never opposed the legality in not a single one of these cases because since the president acts on the premise that those countries are a risk for the nation he has the justification he needs there are plenty of lawyers who have been interviewed about this and no matter their political side have agreed trump is acting completely in his right why are you so set on these examples they only further to show your lack of unerstanding you dont need a supreme court to see that it is against the law shooting people if what trump was doing was illegal then this wouldnt have been able to happen but as ive explained he is in his right to do this also the supreme court in cases like this convene inside a week to review the case by no means years
IAmA,not_removed,because its illegal now the government is really corrupt
IAmA,not_removed,yeah lets compare apples and peaches why the shit not come back when youre done being completely delusional and realise that the president is a servant of the constitution just as any other person goodbye
IAmA,not_removed,oh i forgot you people never have anything good to say about trump all you can do is to shit on people with actual political experience
IAmA,not_removed,im not american so cant comment on what indepth statistical analysis you have conducted to assume the years thing but alright
IAmA,not_removed,i never said that at all my point was that youre so extremely concerned for what is happening however i doubt you show any protest to what is happening to minorities persecuted by countries like these i whole heartedly agree that we need to space ourselves from countries such as saudi arabia it wasnt trump who has been financing the middle east its hillary and obama trump himself has said more countries may be added to the list in the future and if you truly believe in your reasoning there for why it should be then you should not find any problem with it happening yes the way in which the airport process could always be better and isnt always whats desired but it is a neccesary step when needing to control our borders better with these failed states the conflicting statements are no longer an issue as trumps statement is what shows what the requirements adhere to when it comes to the vetting process that information is something i have little knowledge of and by the sounds of it neither do you so it is pointless to make assumptions on what the process will newly entail
IAmA,not_removed,you cannot even argue your point typical liberal call people names but never deal with the topic next youll call me a racists im done with you drop mic spit on your shoe
IAmA,not_removed,its shown in one of the charts
IAmA,not_removed,calm down take a vacation and come back to reddit if you are still mad then grab the tin foil hat from the obama haters
IAmA,not_removed,reducing fascism to an economic policy and i am the one simplifying you gotta be trolling
IAmA,not_removed,i studied history for years what a fucking waste of time
IAmA,not_removed,isis is not a specific threat and nor is terrorism theres nothing specific about either of those terms a specific threat would be a known planned attack with a nominated target
IAmA,not_removed,ding ding ding traitor supporters value feelings over national security
IAmA,not_removed,if you cant tell thats on you compare reporting on each of those outlets to reporting by ny times wsj and washington post
IAmA,not_removed,сосать мой хуй вам уродливую пизду
IAmA,not_removed,where did he make any law or prevent citizens from exercising religion you clearly have no clue what youre talking about way to only use of a sentence to try to get your point across and still fail though amendment i congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof last i checked the president isnt congress nor are executive orders laws and i guess you missed the whole opening sentence of the constitution we the people of the united states citizens of middle eastern countries arent the people of the united states im not even a trump supporter im just pointing out that yall have no fucking clue what youre talking about and are just making yourselves look dumber than trump
IAmA,not_removed,and thats the big one everyone here is whinging about a ban when obama has killed thousands with drone strikes and not a peep thats the true hypocrisy of most on reddit currently ignoring the last administrations horrors and going as far to pretend they didnt happen
IAmA,not_removed,well not accepting the law you oppose on others as your own is the literal concept of fascism you are supporting a man who breaks the law and spits on the constitution followed up by removing those trying to protect it from office you are a fascist because you think its a good idea to silence critic and because youre supporting a white supremacist its not okay to punch either ideology what is even wrong with you people hunting down those who have a different opinion is that all you folks can do a civilized and intelligent human being does not attack a fascist or a communist of which the difference is apparently too big of a thing for you to comprehend he outargues them which is very easy yeah no trump never went around waging terror and fear against the eastern and southern appearing people known as majorily muslims and mexicans s keep ignoring the fact that this was his entire campaign oh and of course hilary his only other argument who is supposedly worse blah blah it makes it a lot easier showing the world how ridiculously stupid you are never did i say nazi you people sure love to put words in others mouth as it suits you eh no no i called you a fascist which you are easy as that and a sudden jump to feminisms whereever that comes from do you hate the female sex for a specific reason or where you bored one day from your daily trailer life so you decided to support the latest jumpstarter among the kkk have a really bad day
IAmA,not_removed,ill take that over memes which is all you have and you know it
IAmA,not_removed,its not a dick dont take it so hard
IAmA,not_removed,we conquered the united states it is ours now
IAmA,not_removed,why has this been downvoted a dissenting opinion that has been properly explained is still downvoted because its dissenting jesus christ man you redditors need to show some class
IAmA,not_removed,the law isnt whatever the president says it is it is the legislation that is already in place be it federal or constitutional law as such if she truly believed that the order was in breach of the law it is her job to be honest with this and provide an accurate assessment using her expert opinion that is what she did as she believed the order to be at least in part incompatible with us legislation as it stands and that to defend the order would be a waste of resources that would be better used to amend the order to be compatible with the law
IAmA,not_removed,how exactly is it not appropriate sally yates willingly defied the white house and most probably understood the possible consequences its open criticism of trumps muslim ban perhaps the quotes highly specific original use doesnt match up here but thats why we use abstract thought sometimes the content of roosevelts message is do not worship the president
IAmA,not_removed,and very shortly into whats looking to be a very scary four years
IAmA,not_removed,i expect the president to uphold the constitution to its upmost decree
IAmA,not_removed,i take it that you concede that it is not a clear case of it being a legal order then article of the united states constitution you may wish to read it i do solemnly swear or affirm that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic you may wish to watch the sessions you have to watch out because people will be asking you to do things you just need to say no about do you think the attorney general has the responsibility to say no to the president if he asks for something thats improper a lot of people have defended the lynch nomination for example by saying well appoints somebody whos going to execute his views whats wrong with that but if the views the president wants to execute are unlawful should the attorney general or the deputy attorney general say no yates senator i believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the president as well as an excerpt of which i quoted in the above comment
IAmA,not_removed,can you cite to the previous presidential actions you believe are equivalent can you cite to the supreme court opinions you believe upheld those action it is exceedingly rare for the supreme court to issue an opinion until after a record has been developed in the district courts and after the matter has been heard by one or more of the circuit courts of appeal which typically take several years you can find the occasional example of when they seemed able to act within a few weeks but they are rare the last example i can think of was in and folks were stunned by how quickly that moved if what trump was doing was illegal it may well be unlawful the immigration and nationality act of forbids discrimination against immigrants based on their nationality place of birth or place of residence this argument has already found traction with the district courts that have considered it in the past five days
IAmA,not_removed,except that it isnt otherwise it would be struck down but hey look at the bright side maybe just maybe if you hold your breath long enough it may magically come true you should try it
IAmA,not_removed,obviously beyond your level of comprehension
IAmA,not_removed,fair point
IAmA,not_removed,lmaoooooo okay you little special snowflake go back to your safe space i hope you appreciate the irony of my statement
IAmA,not_removed,not only would i like the know how they phrased the question how they chose their demographic and what support of isis actually means like if you asked about supporting syrian rebels some people will think bad assad good rebels even though that may include in a poorly thought out questionnaire isis whereas others are thinking white helmets kurds and the national opposition group
IAmA,not_removed,what implies me not being calm youre hallucinating buddy thats all
IAmA,not_removed,no it is not legal four federal judges have already said there is a significant likelihood it will not be upheld you have no evidence and no argument you are just a pathetic troll just go back to rthedonald where you can all fellate each other without bothering those interested in reality
IAmA,not_removed,great response i can assume youre or please refrain from replying to me with more childish comments as i have no interest in arguing with a child
IAmA,not_removed,lol
IAmA,not_removed,welcome to the leftist echochamber where even left of centre moderates like myself are nazis
IAmA,not_removed,shes sworn to the constitution not to the president thats about it she did her damn job its a shame her boss is a manchild
IAmA,not_removed,because its not a goddamn opinion she is sworn to uphold the constitution not the presidency end of story we need to stop legitimizing these absolutely batshit conclusions by calling them opinions theyre just incorrect
IAmA,not_removed,what does this have to do with my comment above which is simply pointing out the quote is meaningless within this context
IAmA,not_removed,my comment explains exactly why it isnt appropriate its not talking about members of the executive branch its talking about the citizenry i shouldnt have to lecture you on the very obvious differences
IAmA,not_removed,we made this impossible right around the point we elected trump
IAmA,not_removed,compare and contrast with some of obamas decisions that were rigorously defended by eric holder which were so egregious that they were
IAmA,not_removed,im on my mobile but you can look up how obama prevented immigration for from iraq and also how reagan used the same justification in this isnt discrimination this is to improve the vetting process there are muslims in the world and to say that this is discriminating against them isnt the case as the countries with vastly larger muslim populations have not been banned this is about controlling the border against failed states not discrimination
IAmA,not_removed,how could it be struck down when the just people are being fired for speaking out in the name of the constitution trump shits on freedom by firing someone defending the law oh believe me right now the us are holding their breath a very slow but inevitable national suicide
IAmA,not_removed,eh insult you can do better next time i believe in you oh enlightened defender of alternative facts
IAmA,not_removed,or maybe its phrased in the way that it asks if they support the isis movement im pretty sure that any support shown to isis that created that would be people i wouldnt want coming into the country
IAmA,not_removed,i am glad you are calm now you make better posts
IAmA,not_removed,thats the america we live in now thank your buddy trump dont like it get the fuck out your use of spanish i learned in grade is bigly sad
IAmA,not_removed,thats weird i just looked at wikipedia and it says there is no continuous wall on the border although there are sections of fence near populated areas and official border crossings google maps does not show walls any more lies this is kind of fun
IAmA,not_removed,thats the response of a child redirect and deflect your clap back game is weak little girl when you want to have an adult conversation and bring something to the table talk to the person next to you at the bus stop
IAmA,not_removed,unfortunate but not that untrue
IAmA,not_removed,if you ever use the world manchild to describe someone generally it shows that its you who are immature its also unsurprisingly a goto word for the reddit echochamber as to your point the attorney general is from the executive branch not the judicial branch she can certainly refuse to defend or enforce an executive order i dont think anyone is disputing that but the consequences for that are clear and have played out understand as the chief legal counsel to the president to refuse to defend policy passed by the president means she isnt doing one of her primary roles im not frothing at the mouth saying she should go to prison or has committed treason because that isnt true her position is untenable though
IAmA,not_removed,this very this end of story she doesnt have to do a goddamned thing for any president not just this one
IAmA,not_removed,so youve read all of article ii of the us constitution the judiciary act of and yates hour officiation boy youre quick nice whataboutism where did i say i didnt or did support obama eric holder or the particular decisions detailed in your link to the point what are you getting at do you support obama and holder youre clutching at straws
IAmA,not_removed,my recollection is that obama slowed the processing of refugees from iraq while they improved the screening process and it didnt purport to unilaterally abrogate permanent resident status that had already been granted to folks without any due process i suggest that they are different enough both in scope and in the status of the people affected applicants vs folks who have completed the process that you cant extrapolate from one to the otherthere is a point where differences of degree become differences of kind you can perhaps see how after trump spends months on the campaign trail talking about a ban on muslims that folks suspect that he might be trying to ban muslims you have a valid point that this first order doesnt speak to say indonesians but since it would also deny entry to for example an iranian who obtained permanent resident status in when iran was nothing like a failed state it also doesnt seem to be narrowly drafted to screen out the alienated detritus of a failed state
IAmA,not_removed,obama improved the vetting process it takes er took to months for a refugee to get approved obama was responding to a very particular threat at the time and he did not ban those with a visa or a green card in fact he didnt ban anyone he just put them through a more thorough vetting process note that trump has actually banned syrian refugees from entering the country altogether not just for days whether they have a visa or not
IAmA,not_removed,not meant to be an insult i mean doesnt everyone american or not know that presidents are eligible for two terms youre assuming hes only going to be around for years im telling you that he can be around for as long as years i guess thats an alternative fact now basic american civics
IAmA,not_removed,it could be but i am doubtful i had a strange experience working in local politics where i saw firsthand the way the weasel questions to get the answers they want i am doubtful of any news source that does not include the question with the results
IAmA,not_removed,i mean at least one of us does
IAmA,not_removed,so youve got nothing im a little disappointed i thought you would at least try
IAmA,not_removed,oh the irony ill be the bigger person here and ignore what youve said good day
IAmA,not_removed,if you cant understand how that would be a proper moniker for the current president youre the problem im not one for hurling ad hominems but the man legitimately has the demeanor of an elementary student with less empathy edit since you edited and added another paragraph of bullshit it is not the job of the ag to blindly support and follow executive orders that is patently false in fact the opposite is true it is the duty of the ag to provide nonpartisan legal counsel to the president and thats exactly what she did when he tried to push an illegal order quit your bullshit
IAmA,not_removed,if you cant understand how that would be a proper moniker for the current president youre the problem ah right im the problem not the people saying wah wah wah manchild notmypresident perhaps if you people actually engaged with and understood politics outside of whatever sensationalist rot buzzfeed tells you wed not have just gone through an election with the worst set of candidates to date portraying politicians or public figures you dont like or approve of as one dimensional monsters is ignorant and simply plays into the hands of their supporters not only that its people such as yourself who are so unappealing in your childish tantrums that you have driven more people away from liberal politics than trump ever could grow up
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt throw a childish tantrum nor call trump a manchild i simply defended the other guy who did i dont read buzzfeed actually i study political science and international relations and work with my state aclu charter i have a better grasp on american government and constitutional law than of americans a blatantly obvious lack of political literacy is what drives people away from liberal politics if the antics of the president arent enough to drive those people away from their party i dont see how making an accurate criticism of him is any more damaging you cannot reason with these people because they never reasoned themselves into their position in the first place
IAmA,not_removed,i didnt throw a childish tantrum nor call trump a manchild i simply defended the other guy who did you stated the term was appropriate and implied my dismissal of a childish trite buzzword as being part of some wider problem with politics in the us actually i study political science and international relations and work with my state aclu charter i have a better grasp on american government and constitutional law than of americans if true it almost certainly isnt your comment is especially embarrassing a blatantly obvious lack of political literacy is what drives people away from liberal politics if the antics of the president arent enough to drive those people away from their party i dont see how making an accurate criticism of him is any more damaging key word here is accurate criticism which hasnt happened he has been called a fascist inaccurate but what constitutes fascism isnt even universally agreed upon so some tenets apply as they did for other presidents too a white supremacist laughable a nazi also laughable and almost every speech he has made has been twisted beyond all recognition by the media an accurate critique will get you attacked by the left as you are enabling the fictitious nazis and therefore just as bad you must believe he is orange hitler or you are shunned and subject to abuse you cannot reason with these people because they never reasoned themselves into their position in the first place you seem to be talking about the hysterical protesters who seem to believe trump wants to kill black people and put homosexuals in camps you know the same people who championed a muslim woman as being brave for protesting trumps ban of people but they ignore she supported the holocaust logic died some time ago and this election cycle pissed on its grave
IAmA,not_removed,its not even worth arguing with you i have no way to prove my credentials other than the fact that i know you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about and youre blatantly shilling for donald trump you have no idea what the ags job is as evidenced above fuck yourself with a rake and have a nice day
IAmA,not_removed,its not even worth arguing with you i have no way to prove my credentials other than the fact that i know you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about ah yes the classic i am incredibly qualified in this specific field but cannot counter any of your arguments despite a superior understanding defence and youre blatantly shilling for donald trump by saying that the hysteria over the muslim ban it isnt a ban on muslims and isnt a ban at all is too much and grounded in ignorance by pointing out that a member of the executive branch refusing to defend an executive order has an untenable position you have no idea what the ags job is as evidenced above it seems incredible to me that someone so qualified as you would dispute what i have said the ag is the head of the doj and represents the united states in all legal matters as well as providing legal advice to the president and executive branch heads these are facts if she refuses to represent the us on this matter because she disagrees with the legislature then she cannot fulfill one of her primary functions you are clearly lying about what you do for a living if you think this is incorrect in any way
IAmA,not_removed,this has nothing to do with the legislature she refused to support donald trumps executive order because it is unconstitutional that was her legal advice to the president and she was fired for it it is not the duty of the ag to blindly uphold any and all executive policy let me reiterate just because the ag works in the executive branch does not mean it is their job to fully and blindly support the actions of the executive it is the job of the ag to check the legality of executive proposals which she did the immigration hold is unconstitutional because it blocks approved greencardvisa holders and potential citizens from entering the us never said i did it for a living when you assume which youve done quite a bit you make an ass out of you and me
IAmA,not_removed,this has nothing to do with the legislature she refused to support donald trumps executive order because it is unconstitutional the ag said she felt it may be unlawful and would need to be convinced many legal minds have stated it absolutely is lawful and certainly not even up for debate about whether or not it is unconstitutional foreigners have no right under the us constitution to demand entry to the united states or to challenge any reason we might have to refuse them entry even if it is completely discriminatory and without merit thats a fact that was her legal advice to the president and she was fired for it her quote was at present i am not convinced that the defense of the executive order is consistent with responsibilities nor am i convinced that the executive order is lawful at present she didnt advise against it she refused to defend any challenge brought against it which is her principle duty its open and shut that she had to be terminated at that juncture let me reiterate just because the ag works in the executive branch does not mean it is their job to fully and blindly support the actions of the executive just as well i never said it was and in fact made exactly this point the immigration hold is unconstitutional because it blocks approved greencardvisa holders and potential citizens from entering the us see above green card and visa holders are not citizens never said i did it for a living when you assume which youve done quite a bit you make an ass out of you and me you said actually i study political science and international relations and work with my state aclu charter i have a better grasp on american government and constitutional law than of americans i replied if this is true then its sad because youve clearly not retained any of the knowledge i certainly hope its an area you leave behind as you grow older
IAmA,not_removed,its unconstitutional because christian immigration is being expedited while primarily muslims are being detained it is a violation of the first amendment border protections also illegally detained a year old american citizen today and all current detainments are a direct violation of court order the executive branch is literally going rogue and you cant even comprehend why thats a problem
IAmA,not_removed,oh no i have no proof how will i reach out

IAmA,not_removed,how cool was it seeing the earth develop so much like the cars technology even the way people dressed that mustve been awesome
IAmA,not_removed,while i know this question is completely out of your realm of knowledge you are probably the most qualified person to ask what do you think about when this generation gets old and has to interact with the new technology of that time do you think they will be as confused as many older people are now
IAmA,not_removed,i saw one of your previous comments on you not liking president trump i personally like him i like how its america first how he will help keep american culture alive from the mass immigration of another society i dont know where you live now but you must have noticed the huge demographic changes in southern california and transition politically how hes working with russia to keep peace between our nations unlike hillary who was keen to show off to russia and potentially get us in a war with them and making sure america is a christian nation what do you think

IAmA,not_removed,how old where you the last time you managed to successfully have intercourse
IAmA,not_removed,do you ever feel like a fraud
IAmA,not_removed,oh my is there nothing sacred in my family must i disclose all of my – and my wifes – peccadilloes my first thought and safest answer was the difficulty in leaving an idyllic lifestyle in ann arbor with children loving their elementary junior high and to a lesser degree high school and moving to washington dc where we only stayed a year but since i am pledged to honesty further deeper thought reminds me of several aspects of the cultural change in lifestyle – particularly having our offsprings cohabitating before they were married but how utterly wonderful has been the result one is never too old to learn
IAmA,not_removed,hi jake
IAmA,not_removed,thats the most interesting question and i really should take more time to consider specific events – maybe i can get back to you later certainly i have never seen anything like the handling of truth by the trump administration but for a longterm reporting of history i think it has taken quite some time for many to realize that franklin roosevelt was far exceeded by his wife eleanor in espousing liberal causes and from the incarceration of japanese on the west coast to turning back jewish refugees he was no paragon of virtue
IAmA,not_removed,to truly know oneself and be receptive to the thoughts and feelings of others
IAmA,not_removed,i hope you been able to read between the lines of my introduction enough to see that i feel extremely fortunate in virtually everything ive been able to do in my years i do regret that i never traveled to what we used to call the orient or australia and new zealand and on a more personal note i regret that i did not have more confidence when in my early professional life i was placed in some rather esoteric leader ship positions that i could have made more of a contribution had i had more confidence and experience thanks for the opportunity to reminisce
IAmA,not_removed,what do you regret doing in life
IAmA,not_removed,the world is so much different now than the one i entered right after wwii that i am reluctant to give advice since i enjoyed children in school the teaching profession was a natural for me when i realized that there was no way i wanted to be a christian minister making the progression from teacher to principal to assistant superintendent to university work and back to my first love a junior high school principal gave me variety challenges and adequate income though honestly with a fair inheritance along the way education at any level provides adequate vacation time the state of michigan has provided an adequate retirement program and i think this is extremely important for one to think about there are a great many things to balance in choosing ones employment and the complexity of todays world has made it much more difficult i know good luck to you
IAmA,not_removed,i remember the river before there was a riverwalk and i recall that there was a very progressive mayor named maury maverick who initiated the program further i proudly claim to have been one of the oarsmen for the first parade on the river – we were polers pushing from the rear of the barge with long poles how beautiful it was to see the beautiful plantings and restaurants joining the magnificent cypress trees i could wax for a long time about my love of san antonio and i was there with relatives a year ago and ill be back in april to welcome some of my german relatives one of the beauties at that time was that all of the restaurants and stores were local you might also be interested in the slogan that was given san antonio at that time one of americas four unique cities you have to supply the other three but san antonio must be one i add santa fe new orleans san francisco how about you
IAmA,not_removed,perhaps its a carryover from the depression years when we were happy to have any food but i enjoy eating most anything and am not particular about its source certainly our eating habits and the proliferation of restaurants is one of the most dramatic changes i have seen in my lifetime most important to me i think continues to be getting good value for the money i spent and i really dont enjoy food and extremely fancyexpensive restaurants when i dont really know what im eating
IAmA,not_removed,i really must admit that i have trouble generalizing about groups however i am generally thrilled with the idealism of youth and their openness and desire for change toward a more inclusive society i feel however that their total absorption on their tablets and phones causes them to miss much of the beauty of the life going on around them i also feel that their age group has helped create the divided society we have in america robert putnams book bowling alone introduced us to this phenomenon that has only grown with the advent of the social media and i must also add i feel there is an impatience for change and a failure to recognize that the arc of justice as indeed moved steadily until the recent election in a positive direction
IAmA,not_removed,quite a challenging question there are so many things i enjoy discussing with young people but one that is certainly at the top or near there is their impatience for change while i also commend this characteristic i do feel they tend to look for immediate results and improvement in society not realizing that social movements and improvement often come about only through years of diligent pursuiti e – the bernie phenomenon along with this is also the desireneed to experience everything right now i know this makes me sound like an old fuddy duddy even my dragon dictation device cant spell that but living that lifestyle has been very good to me
IAmA,not_removed,this first question strikes an extremely sore point with me i find everything about the man to be abhorrent – his divisive campaign and the values he discloses in his lifestyle represent to me the worst of america while i neveer saw him on television i believe he exemplifies the worst of american showmanship he has however brought to the fore and used to his advantage the fact that a changing world has caused the loss of much of americas middle class i have hopes however that the goodness of american society will unite and see us through
IAmA,not_removed,fun think about miniature golf the big band era and on a broader scale a much slower lifestyle sorry i couldnt limit it to one
IAmA,not_removed,because of my white middleclass status i can think of a better time to live and a large part of it is because i have seen more progress in the area of civil rights for alls types of individuals that i could ever imagine wouldve occurred from my texas upbringing i only hope the next generation will feel the same
IAmA,not_removed,currently i would have to say it is the threat of bigotry and hatred and renunciation of american principles introduced by donald trump in american society i cant help but be appreciative of the beauty and miracle of each day and the opportunities we have had in america too often built at the expense of minorities and the underprivileged
IAmA,not_removed,i joined the vast number of adults who had a bit of trouble accepting any new music that came along while ive grown to love most of the new like the beatles i still have yet to appreciate hiphop or atonal classical music
IAmA,not_removed,yours is indeed a heartwarming message thanks how fortunate your grandfather had you around to help i feel the same way with a grandson now living here in dc who has helped me with my blog problems im curious where did your grandfather get his flight training san antonio indeed the world is tremendously different from the much more simple slowpaced confident small world in which he and i grew up while there were dire times during the war i particularly felt this when hitler and stalin join forces in an alliance i never really recall being scared there was a confidence that good would win over evil i believe that this resulted in our truly believing in the truth of american exceptionalism in spite of our slow progress toward justice for all ive always felt this way – until now i am dismayed that trump was able to find at least of americans ready to follow his type of leadership that renounces so much of what i believe it however i am heartened i believe that young people and women are finding their voice and that with patience and determination the next years can even be better interesting that your grandfather and i shared so much of the same – including being spared by the bomb i was getting ready to invade japan
IAmA,not_removed,there really is nothing dramatic that i would change id probably be a little more outspoken in expressing my opinions even though they may have gotten me into trouble
IAmA,not_removed,thanks so much for asking about some of the hidden recesses of my life growing up in a male centered world with one wage earner the choices were easy for me i love my work but i love my family equally well and i enjoyed doing things around the house that enable us to live a good lifestyle on a limited budget from reroofing the house to making childrens toys out of wood to being in leadership roles in my liberal church to making sure that every friday night was family night when the children got to plan the evening the simple pleasures were great events family life is not given to keeping up with the joneses or training to excel in a single sport as an educator having two months off the summer was a godsend although im an agnostic atheist
IAmA,not_removed,because its near galveston because it is near galveston but nothing holds a candle to the alamo city
IAmA,not_removed,how great to get two questions that strike an emotional chord with me regina and i met at north central college in nearby naperville as the first girl i ever loved it was a thrill to leave the library walk down to the candy kitchen and get an ice cream treat and then walked her to her female dormitory with a fond good night on the front porch my last job the one i enjoyed most for years was as the principal of a blackwhite innercity school in michigan when my wife died there was nothing holding me in that city since my children had all moved away i visited my son who left ann arbor for a few years in washington dc and i was hooked what a wonderful city to retire in so much to do so much of it free so many opportunities to volunteer magnificent location on the east coast with both local and international transportation easily available ive never had a regret
IAmA,not_removed,im not hard to please i love any kind of cake even fruitcake and ive recently discovered the very reasonable cakes at whole foods i guess however my favorite with the german chocolate cake from that wellknown bakery in new york city sorry a senior moment – it just came to be the magnolia bakery to die for
IAmA,not_removed,to really get to know yourself your interests your abilities your weaknesses and what truly makes you happy look for as many new experiences as you possibly can and find friendships with a wide variety of people savor the beauty of each day
IAmA,not_removed,by realizing that we all have our strengths and our weaknesses
IAmA,not_removed,this is totally out of my frame of reference sorry
IAmA,not_removed,given the marvelous opportunities i have been given and the fullness of my life i have few regrets as i explained however in a previous similar question i do wish i had had more confidence earlier in my life when i was too early placed in prestigious position to advocate changes in education i now believe in so very strongly
IAmA,not_removed,why would i want to see elvis when i was stationed at camp pendleton in california i had many weekends in hollywood seeing radio shows that ranged from sinatra to duffys tavern to dinah shore to stan kentons band at the hollywood palladium and the duke ellington at an outdoor venue in san antonio hows that for name dropping i used to think hawaii was my favorite overseas destination but having visited the small town in germany where my grandfather came from ive really enjoyed the beauties of germany and austria raised as a teetotaler i still have great difficulty mixing drinks so ill take my bourbon straight on the rocks
IAmA,not_removed,other than possibly being required for work why does one always need to get the latest expensive notebook or phone i really appreciate our new social interactive techniques and the miracles they have brought about but why must they constantly need to be in use the only way ive really been able to at least try to keep up is by having a grandson available to help me
